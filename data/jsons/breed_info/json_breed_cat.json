The Aby is one of the oldest breeds, and its physical appearance matches that of the cats of Ancient Egypt. The breed\u2019s true origin, however, is unknown. They were first shown in England, when a cat \u201ccaptured in the late Abyssinian War\u201d  won third prize at a show at the Crystal Palace in 1871. There are no records to trace this importation, however, and many breeders believe the cats, with their distinctive ticked coats, are crosses of silver and brown tabbies with the British \u201cBunny.\u201d Genetic studies, however, suggest an origin for the Abyssinian along the coast of the Indian Ocean. Top-quality Abys were imported to North America in the 1930s to form the basis of the bloodlines still represented in the U.S. today. Although Abyssinians are not lap cats, they are affectionate and intelligent, requiring lots of interaction. Although Abyssinians are not lap cats, they are affectionate and intelligent, requiring lots of interaction. They enjoy being with a family, and get along well with other cats in the household. These curious extroverts are a little willful, but they\u2019re also fun and playful, always exploring and wanting to share their discoveries. Although Abys like to climb, they aren\u2019t acrobats. They enjoy toys, and can often be induced to play fetch. Talkative and expressive, Abyssinians have a much quieter voice than other feline conversationalists like the Siamese, but they will make themselves heard. Abyssinians are medium-sized cats with an alert, engaged appearance emphasized by their tall, pointy ears. Almond eyes in varying shades of copper, gold, green, and hazel highlight the broad, wedge-shaped head, and give the Aby its inquisitive expression. The small, oval paws and slender, long legs create a fine-boned look, but the breed is muscular and well-proportioned. The long tail is broad at the base but narrows to a point. Aby\u2019s have medium length fur that is dense, but silky in texture further enhancing the cat\u2019s overall sleekness. Each hair of an Aby\u2019s coat progresses from a lighter base color to a black tip across three or four darker bands. This distinctive \u201cticking\u201d pattern is only found in two other breeds, the Somali and the Singapura. The Aby\u2019s original reddish-brown base color with black ticking is called \u201cUsual\u201d in Great Britain and \u201cRuddy\u201d in the United States. In this variation, the cat\u2019s feet, including the backside of the hind legs, are black. Other colorations include the yellow-brown or cinnamon \u201cSorrell,\u201d the light beige \u201cBlue,\u201d and the rare \u201cFawn,\u201d with a light cream tone base. \u201cSilver\u201d Abys are not recognized by the Cat Fancier\u2019s Association. Their undercoat is pure white. The \u201cChocolate\u201d (a darker version of the Sorrel) and \u201cLilac\u201d (a variation of the Blue) are now recognized for champion status in the United Kingdom. The Abyssinian requires little in the way of grooming thanks to its dense and manageable coat. An occasional bath to remove loose hair, in tandem with a regular regimen of brushing will keep the Abys coat sleek and shiny. The breed is somewhat prone to develop gingivitis, so kittens should be taught to tolerate having their teeth brushed, or they should be provided with dental treats to help reduce tartar buildup.", "facts": " Muscular, alert ears Families with older children.

It hails from the Greek Cyclades Islands, which are found in the Aegean Sea. Because these cats learned to thrive on those islands, they are not afraid of water, and they are also known for being comfortable around the various people, including fishermen, that they encounter in their daily life. Despite being one of the oldest breeds of domesticated cats on the planet, it was not until the last couple decades, in the early 1990s, that the Aegean was named an official feline breed. Today, this breed is considered a national treasure throughout the country of Greece, where it is popular as a family pet. So while you might have difficulty finding the Aegean in other parts of the world, where it is quite rare, you will easily come across one of these kitties in Greece. The Aegean cat is a natural feline breed that developed without human intervention, making it a healthy and hardy breed. Aegean cats are known for being wonderful family pets because they have been domesticated for centuries. You can expect your Aegean to be a talkative and energetic kitty, as well as a social, lively, and loving companion. Plus, these felines will even get along well with children and other pets. Providing your cat with loads of attention and affection, while also ensuring that he has plenty of toys and playtime, will keep him happy. Being that these kitties are not afraid of water and are always on the lookout for a fishy treat, if you have a pond or fish tank at home, it is best to secure it so that your cat won\u2019t be able to cause any mischief around your water-dwelling pets. Because these cats enjoy interacting with their human family and are so intelligent, you might even be able to teach your feline friend some tricks. These obedient and adaptable kitties can also be trained to follow your rules. The earlier you start the training, the better. When looking at an Aegean Cat, you will notice that these cats are medium in size, but their body is muscular. You will even note that the body is strong but lean overall, and the feet are also medium in size and round, helping these animals hunt efficiently. The eyes of an Aegean will also stand out, as they are a lovely almond shape, while the ears will feature rounded tips. This breed\u2019s eyes can feature various shades of a striking green color, while the coat will feature a bicolor or tricolor pattern with white as a part of the pattern. There could also be tabby striping as well. Fur colors can include red, cream, blue, and black. You should expect that your Aegean\u2019s luxurious coat will adapt to the changing seasons of the year. The coat, which can be described as plush, will be short in the summer after this kitty sheds his semi-long winter coat. Therefore, shedding occurs more heavily once a year in the summer, and the coat will shed a moderate amount throughout the rest of the year. When it comes to grooming, simply brushing your pet several times a week will help remove loose fur, keeping it off of your clothes and furniture, no matter what the season. However, you will probably have to brush your cat daily when heavy shedding occurs. As with other feline breeds, it is also highly recommended that you keep the claws on your Aegean trimmed and that you brush his teeth as well in an effort to prevent dental problems.", "facts": " Muscular, lean Any cat loving household, including those with children, other cats, and other pets Intelligent, social, affectionate, friendly, playful, energetic, talkative", "tags": "Aegean Cat, bicolor, Greece, Greek Cyclades Islands, tricolor, "}, "american bobtail": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/american-bobtail/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/american-bobtail.jpg", "name": "American Bobtail", "type": "cat", "text": "The American Bobtail appeared through natural selection. They are not the result of crossbreeding a domestic cat and a bobcat. In the 1960s, breeders used a foundation stock of feral and domestic cats with natural bobtails to produce these hearty cats with their wild looks and excellent dispositions. They were recognized by The International Cat Association in 1989, and accepted for championship competition in the Cat Fanciers Association in March 2013. No pedigreed cats were used to develop the breed, and it has no relation to the Japanese Bobtail. The American Bobtail is an especially healthy animal, with no known genetic tendencies toward any particular health issues.

The Bobtail\u2019s wild appearance is never more evident than when he\u2019s stalking a favorite toy, which he will then likely drop at your feet. Although a quiet cat by nature, Bobtails trill and chirp when they are content and happy. Unlike many cats, they take easily to the leash, and like to go on walks. They are warm and loving, interacting constantly with their humans. Not surprisingly, these happy charmers do quite well with families, other cats, and even dogs. But be warned, Bobtails like shiny objects, which they will steal and hide. Owners often report finding a \u201cstash\u201d of items socked away by their feline companions. American Bobtails are medium to large-sized cats with a solid, rectangular build. Sometimes described as stocky, they are still a fairly long cat, but definitely broad chested. Their short tails are one-third to one-half the length of a \u201cnormal\u201d cat\u2019s tail, and should be visible above the back when the cat is alert and interested. The tail is expressive and flexible, and may be straight or slightly kinked with some bumps present. Both the head and muzzle are wide and well defined. The face is characterized by a strong chin, and a pronounced whisker pad. The overall expression is one of intelligent vigilance. The shoulders and hips are prominent adding to the American Bobtail\u2019s muscular athleticism, and confident manner. They grow slowly, taking as long as three years to reach their full mature size. A wide range of colors and patterns are found in the coats of the American Bobtail, and their eyes can be any color as well. Show animals tend to be tabbies with a \u201cwilder\u201d appearance, which is the look emphasized by most breeders. Both short and medium length coats are common. American Bobtails are easy cats to groom, adding to the popularity of the breed. Since both short and medium length coats appear, requirements for brushing vary.

A family in Lakewood, California rescued the foundation female, Shulamith, in 1981. She was a stray, with long, black hair. Six months later she gave birth to kittens. Selective breeding began in 1983. Researchers analyzing 383 cats with the curled ear trait found the gene to be autosomal dominant. A cat with even one copy of the gene will show the distinctive trait. An American Curl was first exhibited in 1983, with the breed receiving championship status in 1987 by The International Cat Association. It was admitted to the Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association in 1993 with both long and short-haired divisions. The American Curl loves spending time with their humans, showing open affectionate and being interactive in every way imaginable. The temperament of an American Curl is nothing short of outstanding. They love spending time with their humans, showing open affectionate and being interactive in every way imaginable. They are easy going, adapting well to other animals, children, and rolling with the flow in any situation. Faithful and oddly dog like, Curls are known to follow their humans around eager to see what \u201cwe\u2019re\u201d going to do next. They are not big talkers, opting for happy trilling and cooing. Often known as the \u201cPeter Pans\u201d of the cat world, Curls remain kittenish throughout their lives. They are vigorous cats with dynamic and engaging personalities. The American Curl\u2019s large, expressive eyes are augmented by the backward arc of its Lynx-like, tufted ears. Their perky alertness is infectiously charming. At birth, the ears are straight, but begin to take on their unique form within 3-5 days. At around 16 weeks, the process is complete. In show cats, the ears should curl within a 90 to 180 degrees arc, but should not touch the back of the head. The American Curl takes three years to mature, and is a strong and healthy cat typically weighing 5-10 lbs with a well-balanced, rectangular body. Whether the fur is short or long, it lies flat against the body. The plumed tails of the long-haired American Curl luxuriantly plumed. Because of its feral origin, the American Curl comes in a wide range of colors and patterns. Both long and short-haired versions are typical. Cat with ears that are almost upright are considered \u201cpet quality,\u201d while show cats must have the 90-180 degree arc. There is some preference for colorations that enhance the Lynx-like appearance of the American Curl, but in general, this is not a breed with a \u201cwild\u201d look, so there is no definitively acceptable coloration or marking. The American Curl has a silky, soft coat. It requires little grooming, but but will benefit from brushing to remove loose hairs. Thanks to a minimal undercoat, however, shedding isn\u2019t much of a problem. The ears are the real maintenance issue, requiring regular cleanings to guard against infection. Although the ears will feel stiff and hard to the touch when fully set, they must be handled with care to avoid breaking the cartilage.", "facts": " Well-proportioned, solid Families and people who are home a lot.

When Susan Manley found him, he was a 2-day-old kitten who needed to be bottle-fed in order to survive. As he grew and reached the age of 4 weeks, she noticed that he had a unique tail that would curl over his back. After having Solomon examined by a veterinarian, it was determined that there was no underlying medical issue or deformity that caused his tail to curl. The cat seemed perfectly comfortable and content, holding his tail curled over his back when relaxed. In 1999, Susan started a breeding program whose goal was to reproduce this curled tail, which she had also noted in other feral cats throughout the northern California neighborhood where she lived. A few breeders began working with Susan by 2005. The cats with curled tails were bred with purebreds and Domestic Shorthair cats. And in that same year, The International Cat Association, also known as TICA, gave this new breed \u201cRegistration Only\u201d status. The American Ringtail Cat (also known as the Ringtail Sing-a-Ling) is a fairly new experimental breed. This breed is still considered experimental because it is so new, but it is already really popular because of its attractive appearance and wonderful personality. These cats do well with other animals, making them great family pets. And they even enjoy communicating with owners by talking back when spoken to. American Ringtail cats are very affectionate, outgoing, friendly, and loyal, though they may be a little shy around strangers. They are great with children and often develop a really strong attachment to one particular member of the family. They are also curious and love to explore. Often, they enjoy analyzing running water and may also hide their food throughout the house for consuming later on. These characteristics are considered \u201cwild traits\u201d that may be carried over from their feral roots. Because they enjoy climbing, playing, and exploring, owners should have plenty of toys and cat trees for them to keep busy throughout the day. American Ringtails are quite large, long, and muscular. They have a strong, flexible, and long back, as well as silky soft fur. And they come in a variety of eye colors. They also feature medium-sized paws that have long, webbed toes, which can spread wide when playing and climbing. When born, the tail will be straight, but as the cat grows, the tail will begin to smoothly curl over the back. The tail, which is muscular and broad, especially at the base, features well-developed bones that aren\u2019t fused together, so it has complete range of motion and can even be held straight if the cat wants to uncurl it. Owners of American Ringtails also notice that these cats use their tails more than other cats do. For example, in addition to being utilized for balance, the tail can be used to slow them down when descending from a cat tree, or to slow down during a high-speed chase. The American Ringtail cat is bred to exhibit all patterns and colors. This breed can feature a coat that is short or medium in length. Cats with medium-length coats would require regular grooming, probably around two times a week.

In the late 19th century, cat fanciers became interested in refining a show quality line of this all-American feline. In 1906 the Cat Fancier\u2019s Association recognized its first five registered breeds, including the Domestic Shorthair, which has been called the American Shorthair since 1966. Now a purposefully developed breed, with genetic traits cultivated to enhance his amiable disposition and beautiful, sturdy conformation,  the low-maintenance American Shorthair is no \u201calley\u201d cat and remains one of the most popular of all cats in the U.S. The American Shorthair is an easy-going cat that openly displays affection and does well with children and dogs. The American Shorthair is an easy-going cat that openly displays affection and does well with children and dogs. They do, however, like their quiet time and may disappear throughout the day to get it. They are fairly independent, and since they do not typically suffer from separation anxiety, they can be left alone while their humans are off at work. They will play when asked to do so, but they are also great nappers. These quiet cats rarely use their voices. The descriptive most commonly used for the breed is \u201ceasy,\u201d which explains their high level of popularity as companions. The American Shorthair is a robust, long-lived cat, easily reaching age 15 and greater. They have sturdy good looks derived from their \u201cworking\u201d heritage. The American Shorthair\u2019s genetics have equipped the breed to be premier mousers and pursuers of small vermin, which accounts for their solid, athletic build. With well-developed chests, shoulders and hindquarters, they excel at jumping and pouncing, and are quite fast over short distances. Males are larger, attaining a weight of as much as 15 lbs while females seldom weigh more than 12 lbs. There are more than eighty different recognized colors and patterns for the American Shorthair. These included brown-patched tabby, white (with blue eyes), silver, smoke, cameo, calico, black, brown, and every conceivable blend and combination in between. This variety, coupled with the Shorthair\u2019s fantastic disposition, makes it one of the most popular breeds in America. This is the animal most people think of when they hear the word \u201ccat.\u201d Most American Shorthairs have a dense, short coat that does not require any special grooming. Shedding is generally moderate, and since the amiable Shorthair will readily consent to a nice brushing, that little amount of attention will keep stray hairs out of the house, and give the cat\u2019s coat a lovely, healthy sheen. If an American Shorthair becomes unduly dirty due to circumstances beyond its control, the cat will usually submit to a bath, but normally these cats can be left to their own devices in matters of grooming.

These cats do well in a variety of families, making them great lap cats for seniors and energetic cats for children. They are good-natured, calm, and easygoing, with quiet voices. Females, however, are typically busier than males, while males tend to be more relaxed. American Wirehair cats are also intelligent and really interested in things in their environment. They have great hunting instincts, enjoy watching birds outside the window, and retain a good amount of independence even though they love being around people. Despite having a lot of energy, though, they do prefer to stay indoors. American Wirehair cats have a distinctive short coat that somewhat resembles steel wool, though it\u2019s soft to the touch. Their whiskers are also crimped, giving them a truly unique appearance compared to other cat breeds. The fur of the American Wirehair is similar to the Devon Rex and Cornish Rex.

Anatolians have medium-sized bodies that are muscular and quite strong.

These kitties are described as massive, with triangular shaped heads, long high legs, and long, lean bodies. Also, their eyes can either be oval or almond shaped, and they are set wide apart on the face, while the ears are pointed and straight, sitting high up on the head. The torso of the Aphrodite Giant breed is powerful, long, and muscular, with back legs that are higher than those in the front. These unique cats also have a tail that is either medium or long in terms of its length when compared to the rest of the body, and the tail can also be quite full and bushy. It takes up to three years for these cats to reach full size, at which point they will be big felines that are truly impressive in appearance. Aphrodite Giant is a breed that comes in all colors except lilac, fawn, cinnamon, mink, pointed, and chocolate. Solid and bicolor cats are common within this breed. Eye colors can include light yellow, pale blue, green, and dark blue. This breed comes in both longhaired and shorthaired varieties. In either case, the fur is very soft, thick, and luxurious.

In fact, if you go to those parts of the world, you will commonly find Arabian Maus living as street cats, surviving independently and adapting to their environment even as the deserts are transformed into cities. \u201cMau\u201d is actually the Egyptian word for \u201ccat,\u201d and these kitties are active at night, preferring to sleep during the day just like their ancestors did in order to avoid the hot sun of the desert. The Arabian Mau is one of the oldest of all of the natural feline breeds. Arabian Mau cats are social and energetic. In fact, because they are so active, these cats do best in homes where their owners will be able to provide them with plenty of playtime and enrichment. They need a means by which to release all of their energy, so these are cats that require loads of attention and interaction from their owners. Also, because these kitties are so friendly, intelligent, and adaptable, they will get along great with just about anyone, and they will even get along well with other pets and children. They will likely follow you around the house, always looking for interaction and something to do, though they may not make the best lap cats. One of the distinct features of this breed is its ears, which are large and pointed in order to help release excess heat from the body (very handy when living in the desert). The tail is also a medium length compared to the rest of the body, and it somewhat tapers towards the tip. Overall, the Arabian Mau\u2019s body is typically medium in size and sleek, making it an agile hunter. And these cats also feature oval paws, long legs, and strong muscles. The Arabian Mau naturally occurs in a wide array of patterns and colors, as these characteristics have allowed the cats to blend into a variety of environments. However, they typically exhibit some combination of white, black, brown, and gray. You can also find them in red, black and white, and brown tabby. Because the Arabian Mau has short fur without any undercoat, grooming is really simple. You can occasionally brush your kitty to bond with her, as well as to help distribute the naturally occurring oils throughout the coat to keep it looking and feeling smooth and healthy.

There are very few registered Australian Mists in the United States, and there aren\u2019t any breeders there either. This breed was produced by Dr. Truda Straede in 1977 in order to create a cat that would be happy to live a life completely indoors. The goal was to produce a new feline breed that would be quite mellow as well, especially since there were so many feral cats attacking native wildlife in Australia. The Australian Mist was born from an original set of 30 cats that primarily consisted of Burmese, Abyssinian, and Domestic Shorthair breeds. At first, the Australian Mist was called the Spotted Mist, but the name was later changed in 1998 in order to accommodate the variety of coat patterns that this breed could exhibit.

These felines are a mix of the affectionate dispositions of Burmese cats, the intelligence of Abyssinians, and the energy of the Domestic Shorthair. They are also even-tempered, love a life indoors, and enjoy being around people because they thrive on human attention. It has also been noted that this breed takes interest in a variety of human activities, including music. It should be noted that these cats do enjoy snacking and eating quite a bit, so they are prone to obesity. Pet parents should take care to feed the appropriate foods in the right amounts to prevent these cats from gaining too much weight. Australian Mists are lively as kittens but will calm down quite a bit once they reach maturity. They are great for families with children, including young children, because they are patient, tolerate being handled, enjoy the attention, and are typically not inclined to scratch. And because they enjoy interacting with people, they do well with children who can play with them, as well as adults who can snuggle with them. The Australian Mist features an average sized body. They are medium boned and have a round head, large ears, and large round eyes that are usually a shade of green. The tail is plump with fur, and their coat pattern is either marbled or spotted against what is referred to as a misty background. The legs and the tail are also barred and ringed, and the face is lined as well. These cats also have a great facial expression because they have a broad chin, broad whisker pads, and a broad nose. The Australian Mist comes in a variety of colors and can feature a spotted or marbled pattern throughout its coat. It can be found in seven colors, in particular, which include peach, gold, lilac, chocolate, caramel, blue, and brown. Another great feature of the Australian Mist is the fact that it sports a short-haired, glossy coat that is easy to maintain and sheds only moderately.

They do not come from Bali, but originated in the United States. There is only one gene difference between the two breeds. In all probability, longhaired Siamese kittens occasionally appeared, and one was registered with the Cat Fanciers Federation in 1928. In the 1950s, however, the idea caught the imagination of breeders who made a serious effort to promote the mutation into a stand-alone breed. In the 1960s, Helen Smith of MerryMews Cattery bestowed the name \u201cBalinese\u201d on the cats, which she compared to Balinese dancers. The breed was granted CFA grand championship status in 1970. Elegant, graceful, and intelligent, the long lines of the Balinese create a svelte, muscular cat that is both supple and strong.

These long-haired beauties have a more than healthy curiosity about life \u2014 primarily yours. The alert sapphire eyes sparkle with inquisitive good humor, to the point that Balinese are often described as big-hearted clowns. They have been rated as the most intelligent of all the long-haired breeds. If left on its own for long periods, the Balinese becomes terribly lonely. They are definitely playful, people cats and enjoy being with a family, following their humans from room to room talking. They are easy going, and do well with other pets. Similar in physical confirmation to the Siamese, the Balinese has a long, slender body that belies this cat\u2019s natural athleticism. Look for engaging blue eyes set in a wedge-shaped head. Two types are shown, the \u201ctraditional\u201d and the \u201ccontemporary.\u201d The traditional sports a coat about two inches longer, and it is the sturdier variant of the breed. The contemporary is reminiscent of the Ragdoll, with a semi-rounding of the muzzle and ears. The Balinese has rather large ears, a straight nose, and almond eyes. The Balinese coat can be found in frost, chocolate, seal, cream, red, blue, lilac, and fawn. The seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac are the traditional Siamese colors. Red, cream, and tabby patterning were recognized as acceptable for the breed in 1979, and there are also some tortoiseshells of all colors with both solid and tabby points. The silky flowing coat of the Balinese has remarkable qualities. It lies close to the body, conforming to the cat\u2019s natural lines, but it does not mat because it has a single layer only. At the tail, the hair forms a regal plume. These characteristics make the Balinese unusually low maintenance for a longhaired cat.

Both the short-legged gene and the hairless gene, which are naturally occurring, are found in this kitty because breeders purposely combined them to create the Bambino. This is considered a new breed as well, as the first Bambinos were registered in 2005 by Stephanie and Pat Osborne. And in 2006, The International Cat Association (TICA) designated the Bambino as an Experimental New Breed. The Bambino was created when the Sphynx, which is a hairless feline, was crossed with the Munchkin, which is a breed that has short legs. And the name \u201cBambino,\u201d which means \u201cbaby\u201d in Italian, is appropriate, as these cats look a lot like kittens even when they are fully grown, thanks to their little body. The Bambino is one of several dwarf feline breeds that are also known as miniature cats. These little cats are known for being mischievous, outgoing, and rambunctious. They will gladly play all over the house, running and jumping just like any other normal sized kitty. And they are so funny to watch that they have even been compared to little monkeys. Giving these cats plenty of toys and providing them with interactive play sessions will allow them to release their energy in a positive way. Bambinos are adorable kitties that make wonderful family pets, too, thanks to their affectionate personality. They thoroughly enjoy interacting with their human companions, even when it comes down to snuggling in your lap, so giving them plenty of attention and love is important. If you wish to travel with your Bambino, you should find that your cat is able to adjust quite well to a new environment. And if you have children or other pets in the household, you can expect that, if your Bambino is treated with kindness, he will get along with everyone. What makes the Bambino so unique is the fact that it is hairless in addition to being short, and when these little cats walk, they have a distinctive waddle in their step. But that doesn\u2019t stop them from getting around easily and with surprising speed. The skin on a Bambino will be wrinkled and loose, and it could either feature a fuzzy, faint bit of down that could be described like the skin of a peach, or it could be truly hairless. However, because the skin is exposed, you need to take care that your pet won\u2019t get burned by exposure to too much sun. You can also give your kitty a sweater to wear if he is feeling chilly. The ears, which are large, will be forward facing and alert, and they can be described as lynx-tipped ears. This means that there are little tufts of hair at the tips of the ears, much like a lynx. Also, the eyes are large and can be described as being lemon shaped. The long bones that are found in this breed\u2019s upper legs are short. The tail should be long, flexible, and slender, and it should taper from the base to a tip that is pointed and may even have a tuft of hair as well. Since these tiny cats do not have any fur to show off, they aren\u2019t as colorful as other breeds. Instead, you can find them in black or cream. Just because the Bambino is a hairless breed does not mean that you won\u2019t need to worry about grooming your cat. In fact, you might be surprised by how much grooming is required to keep this breed happy and healthy. Because there isn\u2019t any fur to naturally absorb the oils that are produced by the Bambino\u2019s skin, you will need to gently bathe your cat on a regular basis.

Brazilian Shorthairs date back to about 1500, when Portuguese sailors brought British Shorthair cats on their ships in order to keep the rodent population on the boats under control. Even though they soon became street cats, they were eventually bred into the modern day Brazilian Shorthair, which received approval as a purebred in 1998. Paulo Samuel Ruschi is credited with creating this breed. He was a cat breeder, as well as the founder of the Cat Federation in Brazil and Cat Club in Rio de Janeiro, and he was inspired to take certain street cats and transform them into a recognized breed.

And the eyes are large and round, coming in different colors, including blue, green, deep gold, and copper, depending upon the coat color and pattern. Like the British Shorthair, the British Longhair comes in a variety of colors and patterns. While blue is the most popular color, other patterns and colors include black, white, cream, tabby, calico, bi-color, and tortoiseshell. To keep a British Longhair looking great, you need to brush your cat at least weekly using a bristle brush, but you don\u2019t really need to worry about actually bathing your cat, as he will take care of that on his own. Increase the frequency of your brushing during seasons when your pet sheds more than usual. The brushing will prevent tangles and matting, while keeping the skin and fur in the healthiest condition. Plus, brushing will help prevent hairballs and will assist in curbing excess shedding.", "facts": " Medium build, stocky Any cat loving family, individuals who work a lot, families with kids and other pets Friendly, affectionate, independent, laid-back", "tags": "breed spot light, British Longhair, cat breed, independent, overweight cats, Persian, working professionals, "}, "british shorthair": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/british-shorthair/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/british-shorthair.jpg", "name": "British Shorthair", "type": "cat", "text": "The oldest of all British cat breeds, the Shorthair traces its lineage back to Roman domestic cats. The ancestors of the British Shorthair were initially prized for their skill as hunters. Big and strong, they were more than a match for any rat or mouse, and thus earned their keep living in proximity to humans. Once a street cat, the British Shorthair is now highly prized as a companion and beloved for its beauty and engaging, loyal personality. The British Shorthair became an officially recognized breed in 1889, principally due to the work of enthusiast Harrison Weir. The first British Shorthair to earn a Grand Champion title under the rules of the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy was a blue male named Brynbuboo Little Monarch. Today, virtually all British Shorthairs trace their lineage back to this one cat. The British Shorthair is an adaptable and calm breed. The British Shorthair is an adaptable and calm breed. They learn quickly, and get along well with all members of the household, although they do tend to bond more deeply with the human of their choice. They don\u2019t like to be carried, but other than that the British Shorthair is an easy going cat that doesn\u2019t have much to say. Somewhat rowdy as kittens, they grow out of their boisterous phase to become excellent companions and members of the family. The British Shorthair is not especially vocal, nor are they bad to wander away. They can be left alone without suffering from either separation anxiety or loneliness. Often described as having a \u201cteddy bear\u201d appearance, the British Shorthair is a sturdy cat with a large head and big, round, inquisitive eyes. The breed is slow to mature, not reaching full size until at least three years of age. They are big cats, with males reaching as much as 17 pounds. Powerful and well balanced, the Shorthair is broad of chest and short of leg with rounded paws and a tail that narrows to a rounded tip from a thick base. Small ears top a sizeable head made to appear even wider thanks to the cat\u2019s full cheeks. The British Shorthair comes in many patterns and colors. The blue variant has been widely popular, but in recent years the black, white, red, cream, chocolate, lilac, and cinnamon variations have grown in prevalence. The cats can be all one color, or they can be colorpoints, tabbies, and bicolors. The coat of the British Shorthair can be compared to a carpet with a deep pile. They have more hairs per square inch in their coats than any other breed. Surprisingly, this luxurious coat requires very little care beyond brushing or combing with a wire toothed comb to remove dead and loose hairs. This should be done on a weekly basis to minimize shedding.", "facts": " Sturdy, big bodied cats Families and singles with or without children and pets Calm, easy going, adaptable, affectionate", "tags": "adaptable, affectionate, British Shorthair, Calm, easy going, powerful, "}, "burmese": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/burmese/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/burmese-cat.jpg", "name": "Burmese", "type": "cat", "text": "In 1930, Dr. Joseph Thompson of San Francisco acquired a female cat in New Orleans from a sailor newly returned to the United States from Burma. Wong Mau was a walnut brown, small-bodied female that Thompson bred to Siamese cats. The first coat color to be isolated in selective breeding was Sable. Wong Mau was likely herself a Burmese-Siamese cross, but her kittens bred true for the dark brown coloration. The breed achieved pure pedigree status in the U.S. in 1956, and the CFA accepted a breed standard for the Burmese in 1959. By the 1970s, the Burmese was the third most popular breed in the U.S. after the Persian and Siamese. The Burmese is a highly affectionate and charming cat that seems to convey an endearing quality of innocence. The Burmese is a highly affectionate and charming cat that seems to convey an endearing quality of innocence. They bond deeply with their humans, and like to spend as much time with them as they can, but they are not demanding cats. That being said, they should not be left alone for more than a few hours, or they will get very lonely. Most will willingly fetch toys, or happily engage in other games of their own creation. The kittens are especially fearless and spirited, retaining those qualities well into adulthood. Over time, however, the breed\u2019s rare intelligence and confidence surfaces until, before you know it, they are running the house (females even more so than males). Although very soft-spoken, this cat is quite capable of getting his opinion across. They follow their people around the house, and seize any opportunity for lap time. They are far too trusting to ever go outside, and should be kept exclusively as indoor pets. The Burmese is especially well known for its large, round, golden eyes, which are charmingly expressive. They are small to medium cats, with rounded, compact, and solid bodies. This not a delicate or dainty cat. He\u2019s broad chested, with the hard muscles of a feline athlete, and is often compared to a little bulldog. He has oval paws and slender legs. Its tail tapers slightly to a point. While neither long nor slender like other cats of Oriental descent, the Burmese is still elegant and has a heartbreakingly sweet and open countenance. There are four colors recognized for Burmese cats: Sable (a rich, dark brown), Champagne (a warmer beige), Platinum (a pale gray with fawnish undertones), and Blue (medium gray with fawnish undertones.) The Burmese has a short coat, which lies close to the skin and is silky to the touch. Little grooming is required, and often loose hairs can be effectively removed just by stroking and petting the cat daily. If more care is needed, a plain rubber brush should do the trick. It should be noted for all aspects of care that a Burmese is a \u201cless restraint\u201d cat.

The story goes that an English baroness had Burmese cats as pets, but when one of them escaped, the cat mated with the Chinchilla Persian next door. Their kittens were so beautiful that people immediately wanted more, so the breed was formed from repeat matings. As a result of the cross between the two breeds, the kittens are friendly and inquisitive like Burmese cats, but have the tipped markings and silver colors of Chinchilla cats. The Burmilla breed was officially recognized after only a few years, from 1981 to 1987. These cats are highly intelligent, figuring things out, such as how to get a door open, as well as learning tricks. Burmillas are less energetic than Burmese, but also more energetic than Chinchillas, so they are great for families that have the time to interact with these cats and also give them some downtime when they need it. These cats are highly intelligent, figuring things out, such as how to get a door open, as well as learning tricks. And they also enjoy playing with toys and people, making them great companions in households with children, though they will walk away when they get tired of playing. This breed enjoys getting plenty of attention and thrives on being a part of the family. In fact, these cats can be pretty demanding and will even follow their human companions throughout the house as they cry for attention. They like being spoken to, and will often answer as well. But when they are content, they are quiet and gentle pets. Burmillas have two primary appearances. The coat is usually silky, soft, short, and dense, but some Burmillas are born with long hair. In addition to their coats, their faces are also distinctive because their eyes, nose, and lips are outlined in a dark and smoky color that contrasts beautifully with the eyes, which can range in color from green to gold. It should also be noted that Burmillas can be prone to allergies and kidney disease. Getting a kitten from a pair of cats who were checked for kidney problems prior to mating will reduce the chances that your Burmilla will have problems in the long run. Burmillas have coats that feature a silver-white background color that\u2019s shaded or tipped with a contrasting hue. Cats with a tipped pattern feature coats that almost sparkle in appearance. These cats are also generally lighter than those that have shaded coats. The main Burmilla colors include lilac, brown, black, blue, cream, chocolate, tortoiseshell, and red. The Burmilla features a beautiful, soft coat, which should come as no surprise because it is a mix between the lovely coat of a Burmese and the equally luxurious coat of a Chinchilla. Grooming requirements are low, as there is little shedding, though you should brush your Burmilla weekly to prevent matting, which is common in this breed. Brushing will move the oils through your cat\u2019s coat and prevent the hairs from sticking together.", "facts": " Medium-sized, muscular Any cat loving family, including those with children and other pets Laid-back, intelligent, playful, loving", "tags": "allergies, Burmilla, Chinchilla Persian, demanding cat, England, kidney disease, opening doors, soft coat, tricks, "}, "burmilla longhair": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/burmilla-longhair/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/burmilla-longhair.jpg", "name": "Burmilla Longhair", "type": "cat", "text": "The Burmilla Longhair is basically the longhaired version of the shorthaired Burmilla cat. To understand its history, it is important to know the history of the shorthaired Burmilla breed. The first Burmilla kittens were born after an accidental mating. Basically, a Chinchilla Persian cat ended up mating with a Lilac Burmese cat in 1981, and that litter of kittens was the first of all Burmilla cats. The attractive kittens featured a short coat that could be described as having a black shaded silver color. After seeing how stunning the kittens were, the breeding program for the Burmilla cat was started. Later, during the \u201890s, the Burmilla Longhair was established as its own breed because of the number of kittens that were born with a longer coat, likely the result of the Chinchilla Persian genes. Today, the Burmilla and the Burmilla Longhair are feline breeds that are still rare in the United States. The Burmilla Longhair is basically the longhaired version of the shorthaired Burmilla cat. If you are planning on introducing a beautiful Burmilla Longhair into your family, you should know that these cats could have a personality that can be described as independent and bold. But they do adore their human family and will often continue to behave like kittens even after they are fully grown, so they can be a lot of fun and affectionate as well. These cats could also be described as mischievous, curious, smart, and demanding, but they could even be laidback, relaxed, and easygoing too. And as you get to know a Burmilla Longhair cat, you will realize that these animals are loving, playful, and social. They enjoy having fun, but they are also gentle, sweet, and quiet. And because these cats tend to get along well with just about everyone that they meet, they are also a wonderful choice for families with children, other cats, and other pets. The Burmilla Longhair is medium in size, with an elegant body that is also muscular. Overall, these cats are described as being similar in appearance to the Burmese breed, but they do have what could be described as a sweeter expression. When looking at a Burmilla Longhair, you might easily notice a few similarities to the Burmese. For example, the head will be gently rounded, and it will taper to a blunt, short wedge. The ears will be medium or large in size, and they will also tilt forward somewhat and feature tips that are slightly rounded. The eyes are large, the muzzle is somewhat broad, and the chin is well developed, while the paws are neat and oval, the tail tapers to a tip that is rounded, and the legs are slender. The eyes of a Burmilla Longhair could be any shade of green. Often, the eyes are yellowish or greenish gold while the cats are young, and the deeper green color appears as the cats get older. In addition to the breed\u2019s stunning eye color, another unique feature is the Burmilla Longhair\u2019s silver coat, which is described as sparkling. The color of the coat could also be chocolate, lilac, blue, brown, or black, and it could be ticked or shaded. You will also notice dark lines surrounding the eyes, nose, and lips, further bringing out these features. The eyes will be outlined in black, making it appear as though the cat is wearing eyeliner, and the nose will be a brick red color with a darker outline as well. Because the Burmilla Longhair is actually a semi-longhair, the coat will be fine and silky. You will notice that there is feathering on the bib, plume, britches, and underside, and there might be a fully plumed tail and ear tufts as well. And the great thing about this breed is that, despite the longer coat, intensive grooming typically will not be necessary. Instead, a basic weekly grooming routine will be sufficient to help keep your Burmilla Longhair\u2019s coat soft, smooth, shiny, and healthy. Plus, brushing your cat\u2019s coat is a great way to bond with your pet while massaging the skin and making him feel pampered.

It was created in the 1980s in order to produce a domestic housecat that would closely resemble the appearance of wild cats, such as the leopard and the ocelot. Paul Casey and Louis Leakey teamed up in 1971 to create a domesticated cat that would look like a leopard and other spotted wild cats. Their goal was genuine, though, because it was to raise awareness about the poaching of leopards that was putting their population at risk. They felt that if people were to own cats that looked like leopards and wild cats, they would be less inclined to purchase their furs. To produce this new breed, Casey and Leakey started by crossing breeds that included the Siamese, Angora, American Shorthair, British Shorthair, Manx, and Abyssinian. They also added street cats from Malaysia and Egypt. By 1985, they had produced a cat with the right appearance, and it was introduced in 1986. As a result of their gorgeous and exotic look, these cats were very expensive early on, especially while they were still very rare. Today, though, there are other breeds, like the Bengal and Ocicat, that are similar to the California Spangled. Also, there are only about 200 cats of this breed left, despite its popularity. The California Spangled cat breed was intentionally bred to resemble a leopard. Even though the California Spangled may look like a miniature leopard in your home, these cats do not have wild personalities. Instead, they are loyal, affectionate, gentle, sociable, and docile companions who seek human attention and affection. In fact, they don\u2019t do well when they are left alone for extended periods because they will easily get lonely and stressed. These cats love spending time with their owners, and they are also very energetic, acrobatic, and playful, often moving to the highest locations in the home, just like a wild cat seeks out a place in the trees to look down on everything. Despite being active, though, these cats are also easy to tame and intelligent. The California Spangled is known for its tubular, strong body, as well as its short and spotted coat, both of which make it look like a miniature wild cat walking stalking your home. Its eyes are typically a deep copper or a pale amber color, and it also features wide, prominent, sculpted cheekbones. This breed\u2019s spots are well-defined and can be triangular, square, round, or oval. The spots are found along the sides and back of the cat\u2019s body, sometimes in rosetted patterns. The tops of the forelegs are also marked with dark bars. The California Spangled comes in a variety of colors, including charcoal, black, white, brown, blue, red, gold, silver, and bronze. The California Spangled does not require a lot of grooming. Instead, a weekly brushing session should be enough to keep the skin and coat healthy and soft.

It is basically the longhaired version of the modern Bengal, which is a popular breed that was developed during the 1980s and was accepted as a breed by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1986. But even though longhaired Bengal cats were being bred the entire time, those cats were not recognized for Championship status by TICA until 2017. Cashmere cats, or longhaired Bengals, are also referred to as semi-longhaired Bengals, and they were always part of the breeding program as the Bengal cats were developed. But the longer hair used to be considered an undesirable trait, so it took some time before these cats were accepted not only as a variety of the Bengal cat breed but also as a new breed on its own. And the name Cashmere came about in 2013, when the longhaired Bengal was given preliminary breed status in the NZCF (New Zealand Cat Fancy) registry. That is when Damian Vaughan, a breeder, asked to have the Cashmere name used to register these cats. Longhaired versions of the Bengal cat exist because some of the cats carry a longhair gene, which is a recessive gene that would cause some kittens to be born with longer hair. Breeders today can use genetic tests to figure out which Bengal cats have this recessive gene, and by breeding two cats that have the gene, they can ensure that Cashmere kittens will be born. Despite these efforts, however, the Cashmere is still considered rare. The Cashmere cat is also known as the Bengal Longhair. The Bengal Longhair will have the same personality traits as a shorthaired Bengal. These cats make wonderful companions that are loyal and devoted to their human family. They are also curious, confident, and social, getting along well with everyone, including other pets, especially when they are properly introduced. It is important to note that Cashmere cats are known for being active and playful, and they enjoy climbing up to high places around the house. These cats also like keeping busy, even though they could be lap cats when they choose to be. They love having fun and spending time investigating, climbing, playing, and chasing. They are also vocal cats and they may even show an interest in playing with water. Cashmere cats will also enjoy spending a lot of time around their family to be near the action at all times. Giving your pet plenty of attention and affection, along with playtime and a variety of interesting toys, will help keep your Cashmere cat out of trouble. But these felines are also intelligent and can be easy to train, so taking the time to teach your kitty the rules of the house could also be beneficial. And you might even be able to train your Cashmere to perform tricks or go for walks on a leash, which could be a lot of fun. Just like the shorthaired Bengal, the Cashmere features a luxurious coat that is soft and features a marbled or spotted pattern. Some cats might also showcase what is referred to as \u201cglitter,\u201d which is basically an iridescent sheen that can be seen on the coat. Cashmere cats are medium to large in size, but the males will usually be bigger than the females. You will also notice that these cats are well muscled and athletic. And the body of a Cashmere cat will be well balanced, so none of the features will be particularly pronounced or exaggerated either. The most popular coat color for the Bengal breed and the Bengal Longhair is the black/brown tabby color. But their coats could be a range of colors, from shades of copper, mahogany, bronze, or gold, to cool gray. The marbling or the spots could range from rich black to brown. On the other hand, silver Bengals will showcase coats that are nearly white or gray, along with patterns that are black to dark gray in color. And Bengals might even feature cream, light tan, or ivory colored coats with marbling or spots that could range from dark chocolate to light brown. Plus, these cats might also have facial markings and undersides that are nearly white and show off the tabby pattern. Even though you might assume that the Cashmere cat would require more grooming because it features a longer coat than the shorthaired Bengal, it turns out that, thanks to the coat\u2019s silky texture, even the long hair only requires a basic grooming routine. The long hair, much like the short hair, is not likely to tangle or to mat, thanks to its texture, so a regular routine of brushing your cat will help keep your pet happy and make him feel pampered. Brushing is a great way to bond with your pet, and it could also help massage the skin and ensure that the Cashmere\u2019s coat remains soft and smooth. And, like any other cat, a Cashmere\u2019s grooming routine could also include regular claw trimmings using feline nail trimmers.", "facts": " Muscular, athletic Singles and families with children and other pets who can handle a cat that requires a lot of activity and attention Playful, social, loyal, active, energetic", "tags": "Bengal Longhair, Cashmere Cat, loyal cat, social cat, "}, "chartreux": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/chartreux/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/chartreux.jpg", "name": "Chartreux", "type": "cat", "text": "Only recently has genetic research proved the origin of this breed in Persia.

The breed\u2019s presence was noted as early as the 16th century. The Chartreux disappeared almost completely after World War II until the cats were brought to California where breeders saved it from extinction. It was awarded championship status in 1987.

An amiable and loyal breed, the Chartreux is known to follow its human from room to room chirping quietly to indicate is intelligent and active interest in whatever is going on.

The Jungle Cat actually has a long history of living with people, as it was domesticated by ancient Egyptians because it had great hunting skills and an easygoing personality. In fact, these cats were adored so much so that they were mummified. Even though the Jungle Cat would occasionally mate with domesticated cats, the first recorded breeding occurred in 1990, and it wasn\u2019t long before the hybrid breed was fully recognized and became popular. Chausie (pronounced chow-see) is derived from the Latin name for the Jungle Cat, felis chaus. As with other hybrid cat breeds, the Chausie is a high-energy feline. These cats need a lot of attention and a lot of toys, cat trees, and scratching posts to stay entertained. They don\u2019t do as well in homes with many delicate objects or in families with small children because they still retain a lot of their wild tendencies. But they can do well in homes with other pets, such as dogs. These cats are also highly social, intelligent, loving, and outgoing, and they seek out the attention of their owners. In addition to playing, they enjoy interacting with their families, so they should not be left alone for extended periods of time. Only cat owners who spend a good amount of time at home every day should consider getting this breed, as it isn\u2019t wise to leave these cats alone for 12+ hours a day. Chausies need to be a fed a diet that consists of meat and no plant matter because their digestive systems are unable to break down grains and vegetables. Feeding the wrong type of diet can lead to intestinal inflammation, malabsorption of nutrients, and malnutrition. The Chausie is one of the largest cat breeds, with a long, tall, and slender body, thanks to its wild roots. But in addition to its large frame, the cat also has a wild appearance thanks to its elongated snout, which appears similar to a cougar\u2019s snout, as well as its large, sometimes-tufted ears. These cats have a lot of energy and are highly active and athletic, with a body built for running, hunting, and leaping. Their hind legs are a bit longer than their front legs, giving them the ability to easily jump more than six to eight feet into the air. The Chausie comes in three colors, which are solid black, grizzled tabby, and brown-ticked tabby. This is the only cat with the unique grizzled pattern, which was acquired from the Jungle Cat.

She was hoping to create a new feline that would display the physical characteristics of a wild cat and the gentleness of a housecat. The plan was successful, and the Cheetoh is roughly eight generations removed from wild cats. Despite their good looks and great personality, however, Cheetohs are still rare compared to other breeds, particularly because this is a fairly new breed. The Cheetoh is a product of the Ocicat and the Bengal cats. You can expect that a Cheetoh will be a fun-loving kitty who enjoys playing, running, and jumping through every room in your house. When they aren\u2019t exercising and letting out their energy, though, these cats will calm down and be ready for some snuggles with their human family. These gentle and talkative felines can also be described as sweet, docile, social, and friendly, and they make wonderful family pets.

Cheetohs do particularly well in families that are active and large. After all, the more people in a household, the easier it will be to give this breed all of the love and attention it craves, and it will also be easier to keep these active kitties busy. These cats should not be ignored, and they should be kept engaged so that they don\u2019t become bored. You may want to consider getting more than one cat if you are going to introduce a Cheetoh into your family, as doing so could help prevent boredom and loneliness when you are too busy or when you aren\u2019t home. Also, if you are hoping to introduce a kitty into your family who will be easy to train, the Cheetoh will not disappoint, as this is one of the easiest feline breeds when it comes to training. These cats have even been described as behaving like dogs, and they are known for their high level of intelligence. You can, for example, teach your Cheetoh to walk on a leash or perform fun tricks. Doing so could even enhance your cat\u2019s playtime, which is necessary to help this kitty burn off all of his energy. For a housecat, the Cheetoh is a muscular and large breed. In fact, this is one of the largest breeds of all the domesticated cats, with males being bigger than females. At the same time, however, this kitty is elegant, and you can even recognize these unique felines by the way that they walk. They can be described as walking as though they were stalking prey while on the hunt, so they appear quite graceful, with a low gait that is the result of their hind legs being a bit longer than their front legs. Also, the head of a Cheetoh can be described as forming an equilateral triangle with the ears and eyes, which are large as well. The Cheetoh features a beautiful, soft coat that makes it look like a miniature cheetah. This cat\u2019s fur could feature one of six different colors, and these include snow spotted, blue marbled, brown marbled, snow marbled, cinnamon spotted, silver spotted, and brown spotted. However, all of the colors will feature spots or rosettes, creating an attractive pattern across the coat. Cheetohs, which are considered hypoallergenic, feature a velvety coat that is thick, shiny, and short. This plush coat will shed minimally, and it will only require a weekly brushing to help keep it clean and smooth.

The name \u201cChinchilla\u201d is a reference to the cat\u2019s fur, which is similar to that of the chinchilla rodent, and this is a feline that has been selectively bred to produce a specific coat color. This manmade cat breed has origins that date back to around 1882 in England. That is when a smoke-colored kitten named Chinnie was born after a stray tomcat mated with a blue Persian. Chinnie\u2019s owner then had her mate with a silver tabby cat, and then one of the kittens from that litter would go on to give birth to the first male Chinchilla cat. Breeders continued to encourage the unique coloration in an effort to establish the breed, and that is how Chinnie\u2019s descendants started to showcase the preferred appearance by the early 1900s. It was also during that time that the first standards for the Chinchilla breed were created by the Chinchilla, Silver and Smoke Cat Society. And, since 1920, this breed\u2019s standards have not changed much. The Chinchilla cat could also be referred to as the Chinchilla Persian because this breed is actually a type of Persian cat. Chinchilla cats are considered docile, gentle, smart, adaptable, easygoing, and quiet kitties that really like spending time with people and are relaxing to be around. They are also known for their loving disposition, as they will give their human family loads of affection. A Chinchilla could become attached to their owners and show a strong sense of loyalty and devotion to their favorite people, so they prefer getting plenty of attention in return. But even though these cats could be really comfortable around the people that they know well, they could be nervous and shy when they are around strangers. Although these cats are not too active, giving your Chinchilla a variety of toys to play with will be important, and spending time playing with your cat will also help keep him happy while allowing him to get some exercise. When not playing, these kitties will love sitting in your lap and cuddling. And, in addition to getting along with people, these cats could also get along well with other cats and other pets, such as friendly dogs. However, because Chinchilla cats are quiet and tend to prefer peaceful households, they may not be the best choice for families that have young children. The Chinchilla cat features a body that could be described as short, stocky, round, and compact. The body will be large and heavy boned, the neck will be thick, the hips and shoulders will be broad, and the paws will be big and round. The legs will be thick and short, and the tail will be bushy. Other features that you may notice when looking at a Chinchilla cat include the eyes, which will be expressive, round, and large, as well as the ears that are small, rounded at the tips, and set wide on the head. The head is described as broad, large, and round, the cheeks could be described as full, and the jaw is considered broad, while the chin is firm. And even though these cats are a type of Persian, their nose, which could be described as snub, will not be as short as that of other Persian kitties, and it will feature a slight beak as well. The Chinchilla features one main coat color, which is pure white. However, you will notice that the coat is tipped subtly with black, giving the fur a lovely silver sheen. More specifically, the undercoat will be pure white and the coat will be tipped with black on the flanks, ears, head, tail, and back to produce the silver shimmering effect. It should be noted that blue-tipped Chinchilla cats are also possible, and the breed also features gold coloration in addition to silver. This breed also features bright green or blue-green eyes that are lined with black or dark brown, so it looks like the kitty is wearing eyeliner. The lips and the nose, which is a brick red color, is also lined with black or dark brown. The Chinchilla cat will feature a luxurious, long coat and a dense undercoat that will require regular grooming sessions in order to keep the fur free of mats and tangles. Plus, maintaining the coat could also help reduce the incidence of hairballs, and it will help prevent other health concerns, such as skin problems. Brushing your Chinchilla cat daily is important, but you do not need to spend a long time brushing your cat, as just five minutes could be sufficient. Another option would be to groom the cat at least every other day for about 10 to 15 minutes. And if your Chinchilla cat develops any discharge from the eyes, you could gently wipe it away using a damp cloth or cotton ball.", "facts": " Short, compact Singles, seniors, and families with older children and other pets Friendly, social, easygoing, loving, loyal, smart, adaptable", "tags": "blue-tipped fur, Chinchilla cat, compact, Persian, silver fur, "}, "chinese li hua": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/chinese-li-hua/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/chinese-li-hua.jpg", "name": "Chinese Li Hua", "type": "cat", "text": "The Chinese Li Hua is a rare cat that\u2019s also quite new because it has only recently been developed as an official feline breed.

As a result, it\u2019s one of the oldest feline breeds that are native to China. The Li Hua is also considered one of the earliest domestic cat breeds, especially since these kitties were mentioned in ancient texts and have likely existed in China for hundreds of years. The Chinese people highly respect the Li Hua, and are proud of this breed, which is descended directly from the wild Chinese Mountain Cat, making it a natural breed that evolved over the years on its own. In other words, the Li Hua wasn\u2019t created by crossing other cat breeds on purpose. The Chinese Li Hua is considered one of the earliest domestic cat breeds. Chinese Li Hua cats are easygoing, affectionate, agile, playful, and intelligent, making them a great choice for families with other felines and kids, as well as other pets, including dogs. They\u2019re even known for learning how to perform tricks! These kitties are gentle with humans, but they do have a reputation for being talented hunters, so they\u2019ll gladly keep pests like mice at bay. The Chinese Li Hua has retained much of its ancestors\u2019 wild appearance, thanks to its brown mackerel tabby fur. The coat is thick and short, and it features ticked hairs that are black at the base and then a light yellow shade in the middle with brown on the tips. Even the cat\u2019s lower belly is a brownish yellow color with pretty leopard spots. Black rings are found encircling the tail and legs, and the tip of the tail is also black. The face features a small black mark on the upper corner of the mouth, making it look as if the cat is smiling. This breed is also known for its sturdy, large body and its wide, diamond shaped head, which gives these cats a rounded face and a hardly noticeable neck. The eyes come in green, yellow, or brown, and they\u2019re large and round, making this cat particularly beautiful. What\u2019s also interesting is that this breed is slow to mature, so it could take up to three years for a cat to reach its full size. But this breed is also quite healthy, as there are no known breed-specific diseases that affect it. All of the cats of this breed come in the same brown tabby color. The double layer, short coat on the Chinese Li Hua makes grooming really simple.

They will follow you around the house like a loyal companion, as well as contentedly sit in your lap as they purr.

These cats are also highly intelligent, playful with a lot of energy, fun loving, social, outgoing, and quite needy. They demand the attention of their owners, and, again, they will get quite vocal if they do not get what they want. These cats need environmental enrichment, with plenty of vertical spaces for climbing and a lot of toys. Foraging toys that reward them with treats and encourage their hunting instinct while stimulating the mind are great for Colorpoint Shorthairs. These busy felines should be allowed to release their energy throughout the day, but they will also really benefit from playtime sessions with their owners because they thrive on the interaction they have with people. This breed can even be described as dog-like because these cats like to play fetch and other games that dogs typically play. Like the Siamese, the Colorpoint Shorthair are refined and elegant, with fine bones, medium sized wedge-shaped heads, and large pointed ears that are set wide and are also wide at the base. Despite being long and slim, though, the Colorpoint Shorthair is a strong breed, with good muscular tone. Other features include a slender neck, thin and long legs, and a long tail that tapers to a point and isn\u2019t kinked. Overall, their bodies are pretty much identical to the Siamese.

With his fine-boned, slender body, long legs, and huge ears, Kallibunker was a true mutation. He was bred back to his mother, a tortoiseshell named Serena, a pairing that produced three offspring. Two were males with curly coats. One, Poldhu, survived to adulthood. Kallibunker and Poldhu were then bred to Siamese, Burmese, and British domestic shorthairs. This gave the Cornish Rex breed a strong genetic base in which to cultivate the recessive gene for the distinctive appearance and curly coat. Unfortunately, the breed almost went extinct in Great Britain until one of Kallibunker\u2019s great-great-great grandsons was imported to Canada in 1965 and a North American line was established.

The Cornish Rex is a great addition to the family, and happily puts itself right in the middle of whatever is going on, but they are not great talkers. The Cornish Rex has a lovely, curved profile reminiscent of a Whippet. The distinctive head is egg-like in shape, with prominent, high cheekbones, which gives the face an \u201cotherworldly\u201d look.

The Cymric is known for its rounded appearance, from its round eyes and rounded rear, to its round head. It also features short front legs and longer hind legs, along with particularly muscular thighs. It\u2019s these long rear legs that make these kitties look a little bit like rabbits.

Today\u2019s Domestic Longhairs are descendants of the Domestic Shorthairs that lived more than 400 years ago. Their fur grew long because of a spontaneous mutation that allowed the coat to be thicker and fuller so the cats could stay warm in cold and icy areas like Russia, Turkey, and Persia. When the early settlers made their way to America, they brought Domestic Longhairs with them in order to help control the rodent population on their boats. Considered one of the most popular cats in the United States, the Domestic Longhair is also one of the most common breeds. These great looking cats have equally great dispositions, but because they are not considered a single breed and have a diverse gene pool, they can have a range of personalities. Overall, though, they are friendly, social, playful, loving, intelligent, and loyal companions that do well in just about any home. Some, however, may be quiet and shy, while others can be aloof or independent. Domestic Longhairs can also be easy to train, can have a lot of energy, are affectionate towards their owners, and are usually also quite open to meeting strangers. These cats are even known for being quite talkative with their favorite human companions. The Domestic Longhair is basically a Domestic Shorthair with fancier, longer fur. The long fur gene is recessive, though, so only about 1 in every 10 cats will be a longhaired cat, making these felines more rare than their shorthaired counterparts. The medium to long fur can range from 2 to 6 inches in length. And if a Domestic Longhair also has a neck ruff, it will make his head look even broader than it really is. Foot and ear tufts are also possible on some Domestic Longhairs. Like their personalities, the physical features of a Domestic Longhair can vary considerably, depending upon the breeds and genes in an individual cat\u2019s ancestry. This is why Domestic Longhairs come in a range of sizes, shapes, body types, and facial expressions. The Domestic Longhair comes in every color and pattern, including solid, tortie, patched tabby, tabby, and smoke. These cats also feature a wide range of beautiful eye colors. Because of their long and fluffy coats, owners of Domestic Longhair cats have to brush their pets at least weekly, but be aware that twice weekly, or even daily, brushings may be necessary to keep the fur soft, smooth, and healthy without any mats or tangles. It is important to groom Domestic Longhairs regularly in order to prevent mats that may lead to skin infections. A weekly 20-minute brushing session may be enough to keep your cat looking great while removing loose hair and helping to prevent the occurrence of hairballs. Regular bathing may also be necessary.

The Domestic Shorthair has a strong hunting instinct and will gladly spend a few hours every day tracking down prey, even if it has been well fed and does not need to hunt in order to eat and survive.  However, most cat owners keep their pets indoors, where the only thing they can hunt is a feather teaser or the occasional leg in passing.

Otherwise, it\u2019s best to keep them on a leash or under supervision when they go outdoors.  Even though most cats have certain traits they all share, each breed has something unique to bring to the table. This breed\u2019s personality varies widely from one cat to the other. Again, this is the result of the fact that it is actually a mixed breed with various genes that can affect not only the cat\u2019s appearance, but also its temperament.  So while some cats may be quiet and shy, others are more outgoing, inquisitive, and talkative. Some have more energy, while others can be more laidback. Ultimately, though, a well-socialized kitten will grow up to be a great lifelong companion in any cat loving family.  These cats also enjoy eating, and are actually prone to obesity because they tend to overeat. Therefore, keeping an eye on your Domestic Shorthair cat\u2019s weight and meal portions is important. Failing to control the amount of food your cat eats can have serious consequences. Overweight cats are more prone to a variety of health issues, including diabetes, heart issues, urinary tract infections and kidney failure. Because of their mixed ancestry, Domestic Shorthairs come in a wide range of colors and patterns. In terms of size, males are generally larger than females, but they all typically feature round heads, medium length tails, and round paws. These cats have well-proportioned bodies and, even though they can come in a wide range of sizes, they are generally medium, or average, in terms of height and weight. The Domestic Shorthair comes in every color and pattern, including a variety of beautiful eye colors that include blue, green, hazel, and gold. Some may even have odd eyes, or one eye that is blue and another that is green, as an example. The stunning eye colors often complement the coat color of the cat, giving these feline mutts a truly gorgeous appearance. Needless to say, Domestic Shorthair cats come in many coat colors and patterns. The tree basic coat colors (or self-colors) are red or ginger, black, and white. From there, the sky\u2019s the limit when it comes to the ways these basic colors combine and develop through generations of mixing. All black, orange or white cats are common mono-color options. There are interesting traits that come with those coat colors, as well: orange Domestic Shorthairs are almost always male, all white cats can often be deaf, especially if they have blue eyes as well.  Then there\u2019s the vast world of coat patterns. Domestic Shorthairs come in a variety of patterned coats, ranging from more \u201csimple\u201d designs such as bi-color coats or the well-loved tabby coat to more complex such as the calico, which combines all tree self-colors into one coat, or the rare speckled tortoiseshell. Tuxedo pattern is also a popular pattern, followed by the rare coat with pointed markings. And each of these coat patterns has varieties, some subtle, some more contrasting- ensuring even more variety than you would originally assume. Because the Domestic Shorthair is a cat that has a short length coat, a simple weekly brushing is a great way to maintain the health and softness of the skin and fur. These cats will thoroughly groom themselves, so you don\u2019t need to worry about bathing them. Also, unlike longhaired breeds, you don\u2019t need to worry about the fur getting matted or tangled. These features make it an ideal cat for busy families who don\u2019t have too much time to spend grooming their cats but do enjoy brushing their pets regularly to help remove loose hair and reduce shedding.", "facts": " Muscular, medium-sized body Any cat loving family, families with children and other pets, singles, first-time cat owners Playful, outgoing, friendly, loving", "tags": "breed spot light, cat breed, common housecat, Domestic Shorthair, shorthair coat, tabby, "}, "don hairless": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/don-hairless/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/don-hairless.jpg", "name": "Don Hairless", "type": "cat", "text": "The Don Hairless is also known as the Don Sphinx or the Donskoy. Russian in origin, these hairless cats date to the 1987 discovery of a hairless specimen in Rostov-on-Don by breeder Elena Kovaleva. This breed\u2019s lack of fur can be traced to a dominant gene, therefore they are not related to the better known hairless Sphynix, which is derived from a recessive gene. Through selective breeding, the Don Hairless became sufficiently well established to be recognized by the World Cat Federation in 1997 and then by the International Cat Association in 2005. A friendly, intelligent, and loving cat, the Don Hairless exhibits an active curiosity about its surroundings. A friendly, intelligent, and loving cat, the Don Hairless exhibits an active curiosity about its surroundings. These cats entertain themselves well, making up their own games, and expressing their frisky playfulness with or without toys. With their owners, Dons are affectionate, loyal, and easily handled, displaying little upset even when subjected to nail trimming or injections at the vet\u2019s. Basically, as long as these cats are part of whatever is going on, they\u2019re happy. Unlike many cats, they respond well to voice commands and easily amass a working vocabulary. They do not do well when left alone for long periods of time because they have a high need for social interaction. A medium-long cat in build, the Don Hairless is a muscular and hard cat, nowhere near as delicate as it may appear. These cats have a deep groin line accentuating their round abdomens. This \u201cfatty belly\u201d tends to get ample during the winter months, and slim up in warmer weather. The front legs are shorter, and the overall body contour is pear shaped. The oval feet feature slender toes with \u201cthumbs\u201d bent inward rather than down, making these cats almost look as if they have hands. Their ears are quite large and open, standing alert and erect over almond-shaped eyes. A Don\u2019s skin will feel like warm velvet to the touch with pronounced wrinkles under the cat\u2019s chin and around the cheeks and jowls. Additional wrinkles are present between the ears and down the forehead, as well as in the breast area, under the legs, at the base of the tail, and around the belly. The long, straight tail narrows to a slender tip. The Don Hairless is found in all color variations. The listed coat types include Rubber Bald, Brush, Velour, and Flocked. They are born with a coat that falls out within 2 months to 2 years. Some cats will actually grow fine wool on their chest and at the end of their tail in winter. The Don Hairless has special grooming needs. Their skin is easily damaged by the sun, so they cannot be left outdoors. In an odd quirk, however, their skin, like a human\u2019s, will tan. They will sweat, and are subject to the build-up of oil on their skin, which can be transferred to furniture and other surfaces.

A woman had seen children abusing a kitten, so she stopped them and rescued the kitten by taking it home with her. It became apparent pretty quickly that this kitty was unlike any other because it started shedding its fur. While the woman originally thought it was due to the stress that the cat had been through, it turned out that this was actually the way the cat was meant to be. Later on, that kitten grew up and had babies of her own, and they were either born bald or with fur that soon fell out. At this point, local breeders realized that this was a newly evolved breed. The Donskoy (also known as the Don Sphinx), is a truly unique feline breed. The Donskoy is known for being a great family pet because it\u2019s playful and active. It\u2019s an inquisitive, social breed that\u2019s very friendly, intelligent, and loving. These cats are also gentle, making them easy to handle and groom, and they like having companionship, so they shouldn\u2019t be kept as a single pet. The Donskoy is a hairless cat breed. Some kittens are born bald, while others are born with fur and become bald over time. These cats have soft, warm skin, but they do need to be protected from exposure to too much sunlight, and they\u2019ll also benefit from additional warmth when the temperature drops in the winter. Donskoy cats were initially referred to as Don Sphynx, but they\u2019re actually quite different from the Sphynx breed. For example, this kitty features skin that\u2019s elastic, and you\u2019ll note that there are large wrinkles under the chin, cheeks, and jowls. The breed also features long, slim toes with webs of skin separating each toe, so it gives their feet a unique appearance. Overall, these cats are medium sized, with plenty of muscle, and they\u2019re strong-boned. They also have a distinctive pear-shaped, fat belly. The coats are Velour, Rubber Bald, Brush, and Flock: Donskoy cats can also develop a fine wool-like winter coat on the chest, as well as hairs on the end of the tail, but this fur will end up falling out once it gets warm again. This breed comes in all colors. Despite being hairless, the Donskoy requires regular grooming. The oil on this cat\u2019s skin will accumulate, attracting a lot of dirt. A weekly bath is necessary, and you also have to focus on the nail beds, nose, and ears of a Donskoy, which can also attract dirt.

In fact, its name is a combination of its elf-like features and dwarf-like stature. To develop this small kitty, the Munchkin, the American Curl, and the Sphynx were crossed, but the Sphynx\u2019s features are the most apparent. This is considered a designer cat breed, as it was developed by combining breeds that have multiple mutations. Therefore, there is quite a bit of controversy that surrounds it, with some experts claiming it is unethical to breed these cats. They could develop skeletal problems, so choosing the right breeder is important to ensure your pet will be as healthy as possible. The Dwelf is an interesting looking and hairless cat breed that\u2019s named for its elf-like features and dwarf-like stature. Dwelf cats make wonderful feline companions. They are described as being highly social and interactive, and their personality can even be described as being dog-like. As a result, these cats are a great choice for families who have plenty of time to devote to their furry friends. These kitties prefer being around people, so they should be included in family activities and they shouldn\u2019t be left alone. And these playful cats are also a lot of fun to watch, so giving your pet a variety of toys will help him release his energy and keep you entertained. Plus, Dwelf cats are intelligent, so they do require mental stimulation as well. The first thing that you will notice when you look at a Dwelf is the fact that this breed is hairless. But there could be a peach fuzz all over the body, so when you pet this kitty, he could feel a lot like suede. The whiskers, as well as the eyebrows, might be short or totally absent. And because these cats are hairless, you will notice their wrinkles, which are most obvious on their legs and shoulders. You might even note short, fine hair on the bridge of the cat\u2019s nose, on the tail and feet, on the back, or on the edges of the ears. Another distinctive feature is the Dwelf\u2019s curled ears, which curve towards each other. They are also rounded and large. And, like other dwarf feline breeds, the Dwelf will also have short legs and a long body, thanks to the Munchkin that helped create this breed. However, you will also notice that the hind legs will be a bit longer than the front legs, giving it a low-lying appearance. Even as an adult, the Dwelf will remain small, with some cats weighing in at around half the size of a normal sized breed, and having a kitten-like body. The neck and legs are described as muscular, the abdomen is rounded, and the feet are large, oval, and feature prominent knuckles. The tail is long and slender, and there might even be some hair on the tip, which is pointed. The head is longer than it is wide, the cheekbones are prominent, and the skull is rounded. Also, the eyes are almond shaped and large, as well as a bit slanted, while the muzzle is short and strong. This cat breed is hairless, so these kitties can be a natural skin color or they can be black. They can also feature darker markings on the face and body. Because these cats are hairless, their skin will be exposed and delicate. They should be housed indoors, as too much exposure to sunlight could result in their skin getting sunburned, and they are also susceptible to cold temperatures. You will also need to give your kitty a weekly bath, as there isn\u2019t any fur to absorb all of the oils that naturally occur on the skin.

The Mau seems to always be thinking \u201cup,\u201d whether that means looking down from the top of the refrigerator or riding around on your shoulder. They do like to have their own way, like many cats, but that doesn\u2019t detract from their easy-going manner.

No bookshelf is too tall to scale, and few distances too great for a Burmese to attempt an acrobatic leap. Due to the breed\u2019s trusting nature, these cats should live indoors only.

Instead, the Exotic is content to spend hours sitting looking out the window, or dozing in some favorite spot around the house. They sleep most of the day, and are most active in the evening and early morning. An Exotic can entertain himself for hours, and thus can be left alone without experiencing loneliness or separation anxiety.

The nose on a Foldex is somewhere between that of the Exotic Shorthair and the Scottish Fold. It isn\u2019t as short as the nose of an Exotic Shorthair, but it is shorter than that of the Scottish Fold. This cat also features wide open, rounded eyes, along with a very round head that appears round from every viewing angle. The body is medium in size with strong muscles, and the bone structure is strong, but the neck is distinctively short. The legs are short as well. The ears, however, are truly distinctive, just like those of the Scottish Fold. You will notice that the ears of the Foldex are small with rounded tips, and they have a single crease that causes them to fold forward and downward onto the head. This is unlike the Scottish Fold breed, which features a triple or double crease that could result in the ears lying flat against a cat\u2019s head. Foldex kittens can be born with long hair or short hair. Both of these will be very soft and plush, but the longhaired kitties will have fur that is somewhat glossy and quite dense. When a litter of Foldex kittens is born, only about half of them will have the gene for the folded ears; the rest will grow up to have straight ears like so many other cat breeds, so they\u2019ll be referred to as Straights. Kittens that have the folded ear gene, however, will start to show the fold by the time they\u2019re 21 to 28 days old. The Foldex breed comes in every color, pattern, and combination possible, including pointed, calico, tabby, solid, and more. In addition to the usual claw trimming and teeth cleaning grooming routine that every cat should receive, the Foldex breed\u2019s grooming needs will depend upon the coat length. Like other breeds, if you have a longhaired kitty, you should groom him more often to prevent tangles, matting, and hairballs.

Like Siamese cats, they like getting attention, they thoroughly enjoy lounging in your lap, and they\u2019re highly curious and playful. Foreign Whites are also extremely loyal, often bonding very strongly to one member of the family. If you\u2019re searching for a cat that will always want to be near you, this breed could be the perfect match. Because these cats can be quite demanding and talkative, before you bring one home, you should be sure that you have plenty of time to devote to these social felines. And you also need to show them how much you love them by playing with them and snuggling with them. Foreign White cats will basically have the same physical features of a Siamese cat, except they\u2019ll be completely white and lack the usual color patterns that Siamese cats will eventually grow into. These cats are also strong, lean, and muscular, as well as strikingly beautiful. And like the gorgeous Siamese cats that so many people love, the Foreign White will have incredibly beautiful blue eyes. Because these cats have a dominant white gene, it will remove any instance of any other color from the coat. With this gene in place, a Foreign White kitten will grow into an adult without ever developing any of the chocolate, lilac, blue, or black colors that typical Siamese kittens would develop naturally. Foreign Whites don\u2019t require extensive grooming, so you can simply brush your cat\u2019s fur once a week, in addition to brushing his teeth, trimming his claws, and cleaning his ears whenever necessary. This weekly brushing should be enough to keep the coat feeling soft and looking glossy, and it can also prevent hairballs and excess shedding.

The Gato is an affectionate breed, but it is not considered overly affectionate, so it is great for families who want a loving cat that is not too needy. Nevertheless, be aware that these cats do require a good amount of attention. They really like to interact with their human families even though they can find things to do to amuse themselves if they are given things like windows to sit at, cat trees to climb, toys to play with, etc. Another great personality trait of the Gato is its easygoing, relaxed, laidback temperament. These cats do not like confrontations and fights, making them great pets in homes that have other cats or pets of other species. They will actually take steps to avoid fights with others, often outright avoiding a fellow pet that is feeling grumpy or irritable. Plus, Gatos are really energetic cats that love playtime, whether they can enjoy a fascinating toy that they can play with on their own, they are busy interacting with fellow pets, or they are able to play with their human family. So if you are planning on bringing a Gato into your home, be sure to give it plenty of things to do to keep its mind and body busy and active. These cats are also quite vocal, making it a point to communicate with their owners. They even make sounds while they delightfully play with their favorite toys. These adaptable felines will even adjust to your schedule, and they will take every chance they get to entertain you with their acrobatic and playful behavior. Gatos tend to be quite small, and they typically only weigh between 6 and 9 pounds, making them more petite than many of the other cat breeds. They also have long bodies and legs. The Gato breed typically features velvety fur that is short in length; however, there are some Gatos that sport medium length coats, though these are more rare than the breed\u2019s shorthaired cats. Gatos come in a wide range of colors and patterns, including white and black, brown and black, orange, and tortie. Those that are Siamese mixes will have lilac markings, unusual stripes or patches, and beautiful blue eyes. Yet another great feature of the Gato breed is the fact that it is really easy to groom. All you have to do is give your cat a basic weekly brushing in order to remove loose fur. Doing so can help reduce shedding and prevent the occurrence of hairballs, while also working to keep the skin and coat healthy and lustrous.

This is a dwarf breed that has been bred to feature short legs and marbled or spotted fur. And because of its coat pattern, this little cat can resemble the spotted African Genet. This unique breed was started by Shannon Kiley in 2006, when she had the idea to create a new cat that would satisfy exotic animal enthusiasts who wished they could own a Genet but couldn\u2019t get one for various reasons, or who simply liked the look of a Genet but wanted an animal with a docile temperament. It was on December 13, 2006 that the first litter of Genetta kittens was born, after Shannon spent time selecting the cats that would be used as the foundation for the new breed. Even though the Genetta Cat looks like a wild Genet, this is a domestic feline, and no Genets were used to create this breed. Instead, this breed has been developed by crossing Savannahs, SBT Bengals, and Munchkins. However, the Genetta might have Asian Leopard or Serval lineages, as well as Ocicat and Oriental Shorthairs, incorporated into the breed at some point in the future. Today, the Genetta\u2019s breeders are working on getting it registered by TICA (The International Cat Association). The goal is to have the breed recognized in major cat registries in the future. The Genetta is a dwarf breed that has been bred to feature short legs and marbled or spotted fur. Genettas are energetic, playful, and affectionate kitties. They enjoy being active and will even play fetch. Because they are friendly cats, they make wonderful family pets, and they can get along well with other animals, including dogs. These alert and smart kitties also require plenty of human interaction and attention. They will seek out your company, so they should not be left alone for long periods of time. Even though the Munchkin is used to breed the Genetta Cat, these kitties could feature long legs or short legs. In a single litter, there could be both long-legged and short-legged kittens, but the short-legged cats will be considered the \u201cstandard\u201d for the breed, while the long-legged felines will be considered \u201cnon-standard.\u201d Long-legged, or non-standard, Genetta Cats might look similar to the Bengal, which is also used to create the Genetta. However, breeders are hoping that, as the Genetta is developed further, even the non-standard kitties will not resemble a Bengal in terms of body type. The head of a Genetta Cat will be longer than it is wide, and it will form a narrow wedge shape, with the skull curving past the cat\u2019s ears to elongate the appearance of the neck. The ears should be rounded and large, and the tip of the ear should only be a bit smaller than the base. The eyes should be large and slightly slanted, the chin should be weak, the nose should be wide and large, and the neck should be slender and long. A Genetta\u2019s thick tail should have a puffed appearance, thanks to its fur, and it should be long (preferably longer than the length of the body). The feet are oval and small, and the body, which can be described as long and tubular, should have long, firm, and lean muscles. These cats can even be described as having a weasel-like appearance. A Genetta Cat could feature several different coat colors. These include snow spotted, silver, brown, and black. You may also see a Genetta sporting a marbled pattern in brown, chocolate, silver, cinnamon, black, or a snow color. Calico, torbie, and white patches are actually considered undesirable for this breed. Eye colors for the Genetta will include green, amber, and dark brown. Those who are in search of a low-shedding feline breed may want to consider the Genetta, as these kitties will shed minimally. Also, those cats that have a higher percentage of the Bengal breed in their lineage will end up shedding the least amount, as they will feature a pelt-like, slick, and tight coat. Overall, grooming requirements for the Genetta are minimal.

The very first German Rex was a feral black cat that was found shortly after World War II ended. She was rescued by Dr. R. Scheuer-Karpin after being seen wandering East Berlin, and she was named Lammchen. Like the Cornish Rex, Lammchen had the wavy hair gene, and she was able to produce several litters as the years passed. But in 1957, she was bred with one of her offspring, resulting in the very first litter of kittens known as the German Rex. As more of these cats were produced, they eventually made their way to America, though the Cornish Rex remained more popular, and because the two breeds are genetically similar, the German Rex is quite rare today.

These cats are smart, too, so you can teach them to play games like fetch, or you can teach them to perform some impressive acrobatic tricks on command. Even though these kitties like being active, they\u2019re also patient and loyal, so they\u2019ll gladly spend time snuggling with you, and they adore being petted and pampered. Ultimately, they love spending as much time as possible with their owners. The German Rex is a unique looking cat with a medium sized body and slender, long legs. The cat is muscular and heavier than the Cornish Rex, and it also has a round face and large ears. The whiskers are quite distinct, with a slight curl, but the breed\u2019s silky, curly, short coat is what truly stands out. It has very short awn hairs that are thicker than the fur within the undercoat, so the German Rex looks woollier than the Cornish Rex. The German Rex comes in a variety of colors that include white, black, cream, blue, brown, red, fawn, platinum, frost, seal, champagne, lavender, cinnamon, chestnut, and chocolate. They also come in patterns that include solid, bicolor, calico, ticking, tabby, shaded, pointed, smoke, and tortoiseshell. Because the German Rex is a shorthaired breed, you don\u2019t need to worry too much about brushing too often. Just regularly examine your cat\u2019s eyes and ears, and brush your pet weekly with a fine comb or a bristle brush in order to keep the fur smooth and beautiful.

Originally named the Highland Lynx, the name was changed to Highlander in 2005. The Highlander has physical traits that resemble that of a wildcat, making it a truly unique looking breed. Even though these cats may look wild, they are actually wonderful pets with affectionate, gentle personalities. The Highlander is a really great breed for cat loving families who are in search of a social, playful, fun cat who is confident and loving. They do have a lot of energy, so giving them ample opportunities to release that energy through play is necessary. Provide them with toys and take time out to interact with them every day. One of the most unique qualities of the Highlander is the fact that these cats actually like water. They are fascinated by running water and do not mind getting wet at all. These cats are also smart and easily trained. And they really like being the center of attention by showing off their acrobatic abilities. The most defining and recognizable feature of the Highlander is its adorable loosely curled ears. The ears can curl back a lot or a little, so this feature varies amongst individuals. Kittens are not born with the curled ears; rather, they are born with straight ears that curl over the course of about two weeks as they develop. Polydactyl paws are another noteworthy feature of the Highlander. This means that they have extra toes, which means they may be able to get into mischief more easily than other cats. The tail is also very short on Highlander cats. It is naturally occurring, so kittens are born with a bobbed tail that can range in length from roughly 2 to 6 inches. Not all kittens are born with bobtails or extra toes and some remain with straight ears. Breeders sometimes dock the tails or leave them long. These cats do not fully mature until they are between 3 and 4 years old. When fully grown, their bodies are similar in size and weight to the Maine Coon breed. The Highlander comes in a variety of colors, including solid points and lynx points, and also has an attractive spotted pattern. Highlander cats can have long or short coats. For short coat Highlanders, keeping their skin and fur healthy is really easy. Unlike other breeds that require more attention, these cats do well with a simple occasional brushing session that will help remove loose fur and prevent hairballs while reducing shedding. However, some Highlander cats can also have longer fur that may require more regular brushing sessions.

That is not the case, however, as the Himalayan is famous for its pleasing disposition and affection for humans. These cats have thick, long coats that are silky to the touch. Early generations of the breed were more Siamese in appearance, but as subsequent generations have evolved, that look has settled into the comfortable roundness of the Persian features, with just the Siamese color points remaining. When the Himalayan was first recognized by the Cat Fancier\u2019s Association, the accepted colors were seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac point. In 1964, flame and tortie points were added, followed by blue-cream points in 1972, and cream points in 1979, and lynx points in 1982.

The body conformation of the Javanese is very similar to that of its near relative the Siamese, but tends to be softer, with longer, more svelte lines. The legs are also long and slim. The body and legs display firm muscles for an athletic bearing in keeping with the cat\u2019s playful nature.

Karelian Bobtail cats are also adaptable and quiet, and these kitties are even known for their curiosity. Overall, they are easy going and enjoy playing and spending time with their human companions. The Karelian Bobtail has a medium sized body that isn\u2019t elongated or stocky. Its legs, too, are medium in size, though they are quite solid, and the hind legs are longer than the front legs. The tail on a Karelian Bobtail is bent, twisted, and kinked, and it is usually anywhere between 4 and 13 cm in length, so it is short.

Through this experimental program, she simply wanted to see what the result of the cross would be, but she was able to successfully create a new breed that showcased both short legs and curled ears (the two most distinct features of the parent breeds). The Kinkalow is considered an exotic and rare breed. It received Experimental Breed status from The International Cat Association (TICA), and the breed has also been recognized by The Dwarf Cat Association (TDCA).

In fact, these kitties are known for their playful personality, and they will have bursts of energy that cause them to run around, play with their favorite toys, and maybe even play fetch. Because this breed is also known for enjoying quality time with their human family, playing with your pet every day is recommended. In addition to being energetic and playful, these cats are also known for their curiosity and their intelligence.

Overall, the Kinkalow has an endearing personality that makes it a great choice for singles, families with kids and other pets, and seniors. When given the space they need to play, as well as the attention and affection that they crave, they make ideal family pets and companions. When you look at a Kinkalow, you can easily see that this breed is a combination of the physical characteristics of its parent breeds, the Munchkin and the American Curl. Thanks to the Munchkin, this kitty will be considered a dwarf feline, so he will feature short legs and a long body. Overall, the size of a Kinkalow will be small, and the tail, which is described as elegant, may even be longer than the length of the body. The head can be described as being tiger shaped, and the body can be described as fine yet strong. Thanks to the American Curl, this unique kitty will also feature curled ears, giving him an adorable look. The ears will curl to varying degrees. Kittens will start off with straight ears like other breeds, but the ears will slowly curl as they grow. However, some Kinkalows never develop the curled ears, even though they carry the gene for them. The Kinkalow can feature any color and pattern. This means that you might encounter a Kinkalow that features a white coat, and you might find another who has a chocolate colored coat. Other common colors and patterns include calico, tortie, tabby, gray, orange, cream, and black.

Intelligent, talkative, and interactive, these cats do not like to be alone for long periods of time, but they are willing to seek companionship from other animals, even dogs. Many will happily play fetch, and they enjoy their lap time, lavishing expressive affection on their humans and exhibiting great trust in their owners. Although not aggressive, they can be given to horseplay, so it\u2019s good to keep your Korat\u2019s nails trimmed.

A heavy, short neck supports the head and if looked at straight on, the shoulders are wider than the chest itself. These cats are somewhat slow to develop physically, and can appear awkward and gawky up to four years of age. Even their eye color can fluctuate until they are fully developed. The Korat\u2019s color is described as a silver tipped blue, a highlighting which gives its coat something of a shimmer. The light color at the roots increases in tones of blue up the shaft to the silver tip. The muzzle and toes especially display this silver highlighting. The Korat\u2019s coat has only one layer.

Those seeking a cat who will be devoted to its human family will be pleased with the Kurilian Bobtail, as these kitties enjoy plenty of lap time and sharing the bed at night to sleep with their owners. The most distinctive physical feature of the Kurilian Bobtail is their \u2014 you guessed it \u2013bobbed tail.

It can range from 2 to 10 vertebrae, and it resembles a puffy pom-pom, but every cat has a unique tail structure, much like a fingerprint all its own. In other words, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to find a pair of identical Kurilian Bobtail tails. These cats also have a muscular build, which causes them to weigh as much as 15 pounds. Their bodies are medium to large in size, though compact with a large head, broad chest, and walnut-shaped eyes. They are solid and strong, with males being larger than females, and the coat length can range from short to semi-long. The Kurilian Bobtail comes in a wide range of colors and patterns, including red, gray, and bobcat stripes, as well as silver highlights, solid, tabby, and any color with white.

But even though this is a newer breed, the exact dates for its origins are not entirely clear. It is believed that this breed was created in 1987 or 1991 by Terri Harris, who was an American breeder that experimented with breeding a Selkirk Rex and a Munchkin. Her goal was to create a new cat who would be short but would also feature the unique coat of the Selkirk Rex, and that is what she got. Because this feline is a crossbreed and it involves the Munchkin, it is one of several dwarf breeds.

Give this playful and energetic kitty a variety of toys to play with, and make it a point to spend time petting your cat and giving him the attention that he craves. In addition to its distinctive coat, the Lambkin also has an interesting looking tail. You will notice that the tail is long, curved, and fluffy, and it even tapers to a rounded tip. Also, as you would expect from a dwarf breed, these kitties will have short, thick legs. But the short legs are on a long body, and the hind legs will be taller than the front legs. These little cats feature a round face and beautiful round eyes. Their chest will be full, medium-long, round, and broad. Lambkin kittens will have curly hair, but their fur will straighten at around 16 weeks of age (some will even lose their fur). Then, when they are anywhere from 8 to 10 months of age, the fur will become curly again. The Lambkin can feature a wide range of colors. In fact, you can find these cats in just about every color and pattern for domesticated cat breeds. The Lambkin features a unique coat that is described as plush and curly.

Basically, two unrelated litters had some unique kittens, so the Gobbles carefully evaluated their health to be certain that their unusual appearance wasn\u2019t the result of a disease or illness. In order to prove that the appearance was, indeed, due to a gene, Johnny Gobble had two of the unrelated cats breed, and they produced the very first Lykoi that was actually intentionally bred. Ultimately, it was determined that this gene was recessive, so to reduce inbreeding, outcrossing with black domestic cats continued, especially since the mother to one of the litters was a black Domestic Shorthair. The Lykoi cat breed is also known Werewolf cat \u2013 this is due to its werewolf-like appearance. Lykoi cats are highly intelligent and are known for being problem solvers. They enjoy being with people, playing alone, and playing with toys. And when there\u2019s more than one Lykoi in the same space, they get along really well.

The fur is short to medium length, and it features coarse or fine hair, though it will be distributed thinly over the cat\u2019s body. The Lykoi is the only cat that has a roan coat pattern, and its partial hairlessness could vary from cat to cat. For example, some might be totally hairless, while others might be almost totally full of fur. However, these cats will molt the majority of their fur at least one time, and they\u2019ll always be without hair around the chin, muzzle, backs of the ears, nose, and eyes. They also have sparse fur on the feet and legs. Because of the lack of hair on the face, the Lykoi are often referred to as werewolf cats.

These cats also have tails that are shorter than the body, along with medium legs, further giving them the look of a werewolf. The Lykoi breed has a distinctive black/gray coat that could include white within the mix. If there\u2019s more white, the cat will appear even more silver. The skin color is pink until exposed to sunlight, at which point it can become tan and ultimately darken to a black hue. Kittens are born completely black, but within 2-4 weeks, the color pattern will become apparent, along with the hairlessness.

No one can tell for sure where and when exactly these gorgeous cats came to be, but most agree that the United States of America are where the breed was most likely developed into what it is today. There are a lot of myths surrounding the origin of the Maine Coon, and one of the most popular theories around is that the breed was developed from 6 cats Marie Antoinette sent to the Americas while planning her escape from the French revolutionaries (which we all know didn\u2019t end well for her). These cats were supposedly smuggled onto a ship to the colonies- or Wiscasset, Maine, to be precise- and their destination is what gave these cats their name. Another of these unlikely theories includes the biologically impossible notion that the Maine Coon is the descendent of a domestic cat and a raccoon. While it sounds like fun, that\u2019s definitely not how the breed came to be. Most experts agree that the Maine Coon are the result of matings between shorthair cats native to the United States and some of the longhaired breeds imported from overseas, but the specifics remain a mystery.  The first mentions of Maine Coon cats was in an opera called \u201cCaptain Jinks of the Horse Marines\u201d which made its debut in 1861. and featured a black and white Maine Coon. It was the year before that the first Maine Coon show ever took place in the city of Skowhegan in Main, so it might be where the writer got his inspiration. These cats have long, thick hair that evolved naturally to help them survive the harsh winters of the northeast coast. Once regarded as basic barn cats, the breed was thought to have disappeared completely in the 1950s. However, enthusiasts worked to rescue the Maine Coon from extinction, forming the Maine Coon Breeders and Fanciers Association in 1968. The breed was accepted for championship status by the CFA in 1976, and is currently the second most popular breed in the United States.  Maine Coons are attentive enough to be almost intrusive at times.  While every cat will have its own unique personality, there are still some shared characteristics for all breeds. In the case of Maine Coone cats, you can expect most of them to be friendly, affectionate and silly. Whether it\u2019s their large size to blame, but many describe them as dogs of the cat world. So if you want a gentle giant in your family or a pet that brings the best traits of both the cat and dog world to the table, Maine Coon is your guy (or gal!).  Maine Coons are attentive enough to be almost intrusive at times. They like to be a part of anything that\u2019s going on, and don\u2019t take kindly to being on the wrong side of a closed door. They enjoy playing in water, and will even wash their food before they eat. It\u2019s both hilarious and unusual- these are just some of the quirks these big kitties have. Unlike most felines which boast willfulness and stubbornness, Maine Coons are trainable and even though highly intelligent, they retain a kind of kittenish energy throughout their lives. They like interaction, but tend to prefer to be close to their humans rather than \u201con\u201d them. They rarely use their voices, and when they do, the sound is a distinct chirp or trill, often with an inquisitive or independent tone. Their warm and friendly character only adds to their appeal- many pet owners choose Maine Coons more because of their behavior and temperament than their stunning looks, and that speaks volume about their personality. Maine Coons are big cats, with some males weighing as much as 25 lbs. Their large size is definitely their most distinct trait! They have muscular, rectangular bodies with broad chests. Slow to mature, individuals do not reach their full size for three to five years. Their thick coats are water resistant, with thicker growth on their ruff, stomach, and britches where they most need protection from cold and wet conditions. Their bushy tails wrap easily around their bodies to provide an additional source of warmth. These cats have large rounded feet with tufts that serve as natural snowshoes. Their eyes are big and round and can be copper, green, or gold in tone.  The traditional coloration for this breed is a brown tabby, but the coat can actually be any shade except pointed colors or patterns. Most common solid colors are black, cream, white, and blue, and there are also variations such as tortie or part-white combinations. In fact, experts say that there are over 84 distinct colors and patterns of Maine Coon coat, meaning that any pet owner can find a specimen of this breed to suit their own liking. The silky coat of the Maine Coon has a tendency to be somewhat oily, but although dense, little grooming is required. These cats are good at self-maintenance, but like the attention of being brushed or combed. Once a week is sufficient to keep the coat in good shape, but you may find that the cat enjoys the interaction enough to make more frequent and shorter grooming periods practical and pleasurable for both parties. As with any long-haired breed, a combination of a bristled brush and a wire comb is good.", "facts": " large cat, heavy coat Families with yards.

The gene for this cat\u2019s distinctive lack of a tail is dominant, and spread rapidly through the cat population isolated on the island. It is theorized that during the period when the Vikings were in control of the Isle of Man, the longhair gene was introduced via Norwegian Forest Cats. The original island cats were shorthaired. A \u201cworking cat\u201d by trade, the Manx is known for its intelligence and excellent personality.

The playful and intelligent Manx is a devoted family member. They are known for tearing off in a rapid run, executing sharp turns flawlessly thanks to their strong hindquarters. These cats are highly interactive and reputed to have a distinct sense of humor, even playing jokes on their humans. This breed gets along famously with other pets and with children, and they have something of a protective streak. Their hunting heritage is never far from their minds, so a Manx will willingly kill insects for their humans, and go after any rodent silly enough to cross their path. A mother will teach her young to hunt efficiently even if the only prey available to her for demonstration purposes is a catnip mouse. Genetically, it is possible for two Manx cats to produce offspring in a single litter with all variations of tail length and conformation. Only those with no tail at all, known as \u201crumpy,\u201d are eligible to be shown. They have only a slight bone rise at the point at which a tail would begin. There are, however, cats with full tails, and with every length in between. The cats that do have tails are valued in the Manx line as they keep the breed healthy and strong. The Manx is a robust, rounded cat with full cheeks that make them look as if they have jowls. The hindquarters are significantly longer than the front legs. There is a continuous arch down the back from the shoulders to the rump. This cat has large, round eyes that tilt slightly toward the ears, which are wide based, tapering upward. There are both short and long haired varieties of Manx, both with dense double coats. The Manx can be found in a broad range of colors and patterns. Whether a Manx has short or long hair, his double coat is dense. The texture on the shorter coats is somewhat \u201chard,\u201d while the long-haired cat is silky to the touch.

In fact, there are legends from ancient Siam that contained stories about these lovely cats, which have the Siamese point colors combined with the bobbed tail of a Manx. This breed is naturally found throughout many parts of Southeast Asia, Iraq, Iran, Mongolia, Burma, Laos, China, and Vietnam. It was not until the latter part of the 19th century that roughly 200 cats, considered \u201croyal,\u201d were gifted to Nicholas II, who was the Tsar of Russia. They were given to him by the King of Siam, Chulalongkorn, and many of these cats had distinct kinked tails that were shorter than that of other felines. Other bobtailed kitties were also brought to Russia from Southeast Asia, and they are the ancestors of the Mekong Bobtail. Until the 1980s, this breed wasn\u2019t very well known, but today, it is more popular than ever. Mekong Bobtail cats are friendly, social creatures who like to show their affectionate to their owners. Mekong Bobtail cats are friendly, social creatures who like to show their affectionate to their owners. These cats are also generally quiet, though they are curious. These cats are extremely loyal, and they love being near their human companions as much as possible. In fact, they are often compared to dogs because they are so loyal, trainable, and intelligent. They even get along well with just about anyone, including children and other pets. Despite their short bobbed tail, these cats are agile and athletic, and they love to climb, spring, and play, so give your pet plenty of room to release his energy every day. The Mekong Bobtail has a medium sized body that has good muscle tone and is elegant and lean. The legs are also slender, with the hind legs being a bit longer than the front legs. The paws are oval. The tail is the most unique feature of this breed, as it is very short. Every tail is different, however, because there are various combinations of curves and kinks that are possible. The length can vary but, generally, the bobtail has a minimum of three vertebrae, and it shouldn\u2019t be longer than a quarter of the cat\u2019s total body length. The coat, which is glossy and short, has hardly any undercoat, so it lies close to the skin. The shape of the head features a strong chin, and the ears are broad at their base and medium in size. The eyes of the Mekong Bobtail are also particularly beautiful, as they are blue like those of a Siamese. These eyes are also almond shaped, so they have a slight slant. The Mekong Bobtail is a truly beautiful breed. These cats come in all of the pointed colors without white. These include seal point, blue point, tabby point, tortie point, chocolate point, lilac point, and red cream.

His vision was to develop a short-legged cat with fur restricted to the extremities as a variation on the color pointing seen in breeds like the Siamese. McSorley crossed a Munchin with a Sphynx, and also used a Devon Rex and a Burmese as he worked to perfect the breed. The first cat to meet McSorley\u2019s boals was born in July 2000. By 2005, some 50 Minskin specimens existed. Currently, the development of the breed is being monitored by The International Cat Association. Outgoing and affectionate, the Minskin like the company of its humans, and is especially good with children and other pets. The Minskin has very short legs, but they retain the same level of agility as any other active breed. Although a Minskin may have to be more inventive about finding a way to get to the topmost cabinet in the house, they always seem to figure it out! Outgoing and affectionate, the Minskin like the company of its humans, and is especially good with children and other pets. Intelligent, with a decidedly determined air, the Minskin is a friendly and entertaining companion. They adapt unusually well to new surroundings, quickly making themselves at home and thriving. They have an endearing eagerness to please, and communicate their needs well. They are not loud, but they easily make themselves understood. The Minskin is one of the newest of all cat breeds. It has short legs, with fur only appearing at the \u201cpoints\u201d (tail, legs, nose, ears, and face.) Sparse hair covers the body, but the belly is always hairless. Where fur is present, it feels like the finest cashmere with the sheen of satin. Elsewhere the body is warm to the touch. Not surprisingly, shedding is minimal. The Minskin has a stocky, semi-cobby body and stands low to the ground. Large ears top a rounded head and equally round and big eyes lend a sweet and inquisitive expression to this funny little cat\u2019s facial features. Because an average Minksin weighs in at 4 pounds, they are quite good cats to have in smaller homes and apartments. Without question, the Minskin\u2019s appearance is odd, as is that of almost any hairless cat, but their personalities are so engaging that it\u2019s almost impossible not to fall in love with these little imps of the cat world. The Minskin comes in all colors and patterns. A Minskin is very easy to groom, requiring only regular bathing with a mild shampoo. This helps to keep their skin healthy, and to prevent the buildup of oils. Shedding is very minimal. Like all hairless cats, they do need protection from excessive exposure to the sun, and their skin should be checked regularly.

This new breed is simply a cross between a Persian and a Munchkin cat, so it has the short legs of a Munchkin and the beauty of a Persian. The Minuet Cat is a  cross between a Persian and a Munchkin cat. These cats are really affectionate and social, as they love to be around people. Like Persians, Minuet cats are really gentle, but they also have the curiosity and energy that typically comes with a Munchkin. Because of their high energy levels, these cats love to play and should be in a household that will nurture that playfulness with plenty of attention and toys. Minuet cats are wonderful family pets, as they are very sweet and loving, and they get along well with children and other pets. They really do not like being alone, so they are best for families that will have plenty of time to devote to their pets. The Minuet cat is distinctively short, which is why it was named after Napoleon Bonaparte. But even though many of these cats have short legs, there are some kittens that will be born with long legs while still retaining all of the other unique physical features of the breed. In addition to its small size, this breed is known for its roundness, from its round face and its large, round eyes, to its round body and strong muscles. And these cats have a broad, straight nose, which is another adorable feature that is different from the snub nose of a Persian. The thick coat of a Minuet cat can be long or short, but it is always lush and soft. The shorthaired cats have dense and plush fur, while the longhaired kitties in this breed will have a straight coat that is also soft but has a thick undercoat. Overall, the round body of a Minuet cat is medium in size. Despite their petite stature, however, these cats are quite strong and are always ready to exercise through play. Minuet cats come in every color and pattern, including those that are outside of the typical Persian colors. For example, you can find shaded, mink, pointed, sepia, chocolate, lilac, bicolor, and cinnamon Minuet kitties. They can also be white with green eyes, as well as odd-eyed, which means one eye will be a different color from the other. Minuet cats tend to require a moderate level of grooming, but the amount of grooming necessary will also depend upon the length of the coat. Shorthaired kitties will do well with a weekly brushing, while longhaired cats will need more frequent brushing, such as twice a week, to prevent matting and tangles and keep the coat looking and feeling great.", "facts": " Medium-size, short legs Great for all families and singles, including those with other pets and children Sweet, loving, easygoing, playful, social, energetic", "tags": "Minuet cat, Munchkin, Napoleon, short legs, "}, "munchkin": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/munchkin/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/munchkin-cat.jpg", "name": "Munchkin", "type": "cat", "text": "The first recorded reference to a short-legged breed of cats originates in the UK in the 1940s.

Blackberry\u2019s litters included both short and long-legged offspring until one of the kittens, Toulouse, was bred back to Blackberry to establish the true Munchkin breed. The short-legged characteristic is the result of a natural genetic mutation (achondroplastic dwarfism) and is similar to the mechanism that creates the short stature of canine breeds like the Dachsunds and the Corgi. Thankfully, however, the supple feline spine saves the Munchkin from the kinds of back problems these dogs experience.

Munchkins are fun-loving cats that scurry about on their short legs chasing toys and happily running around the house. They have a charming way of sitting up on their hind legs when they want to see something better that makes them look like rabbits or kangaroos. Since many breeds have been used to achieve the Munchkin appearance, an individual cat\u2019s personality can take on almost any trait, but on a whole, these cats have the reputation for being loving, sociable companions. They are also unusually confident and intelligent \u2014 adventuresome, in fact \u2014 perhaps because as dwarfs, they are forced to do more than an average amount of problem solving to do all the things they want to do simply because they\u2019re cats! One particularly charming trait of the breed is their readiness to take on their long-legged feline counterparts in just about anything from a wrestling match to finding a way to reach their seemingly impossible vertical goals. Munchkins are medium in size and appear quite \u201cnormal\u201d apart from their stubby legs. Their front legs are, on average, 3 inches, with somewhat longer back legs. Neither the front nor the hind legs should be bowed or otherwise malformed. Their feet are compact and round. Munchkins have muscular bodies, but are moderately boned. They are however, quite strong, and tend to be extremely healthy. Their heads are a modified wedge, but with pleasantly rounded contours. Lovely almond-shaped eyes complete the sweet, at times whimsical expression for which this breed is known. Munchkins appear in every combination of coat color and pattern, and have both short and long hair. The Munchkin is not a high maintenance cat, although long-haired individuals may need more grooming to remove dead hair from the coat in order to avoid matting.

Even though he was a breeder of Basset Hounds, Smith was interested in the Munchkin Cat and its unique genetics. For his breeding program, Smith used what were known as doll faced Persian kitties that featured a longer nose and also had an attractive expression. It was not until 2001 that he got in touch with TICA to add his new breed to the collection of Experimental Breeds. By 2002, the breed\u2019s status was Registration Only, but he left the project in 2008, allowing other breeders to continue the work of registering the breed.

They are social and friendly, and they have a warm personality. These cats are playful and active, and they enjoy interacting with their human family, so making sure you have the time to spend with your pet is important. They do not like being left alone, and instead prefer the company of people, other pets, and other kitties. And if you are in search of a cat that will enjoy snuggling with you, the Napoleon will not disappoint. A Napoleon can be described as affectionate, people-oriented, and gentle, but they are also curious and filled with energy. Give your Napoleon a variety of toys to play with, and do not be surprised by this kitty\u2019s energetic demeanor as he runs around your house. The body of a Napoleon can be compared to that of a Dachshund dog. These cats are medium in size and strong. Their body is low-slung, and they have solid and strong boning with good musculature. The legs will be short for the standard version of the breed, but the legs will be long for the non-standard version. The beautiful little Napoleon Cat features a round face with big, round eyes that are set moderately apart. The cheeks and the muzzle, as well as the head, are also described as round. The ears will be small to medium in size. The nose will be broad and straight, and because these cats don\u2019t feature the short nose of the Persian, they also do not tend to have the respiratory problems that could come along with it. Also, when you pet a Napoleon, you will quickly notice that the fur is luxurious and plush, and it can either be long or short. The longer coat features a thick undercoat and straight, soft hairs. The shorter coat is dense and soft. A Napoleon kitty can feature a wide variety of gorgeous colors and patterns. In terms of grooming, a Napoleon will require a moderate level of care. However, the amount of grooming will also depend upon the type of coat that your kitty sports. If your Napoleon has short fur, brushing your pet once a week may be just enough to keep the coat looking smooth and healthy. But if your cat has a longer coat, you may need to brush your pet at least two times a week, especially to prevent matting.

The goal was to recreate the look of long-haired Russian cats that were popular in Victorian times. Opera lover Cora Cobb of Denver, Colorado recognized the unique qualities of her two blue-grey cats, Siegfried and Brunhilde. Their father was a blue cat with long-hair that resembled an Angora. The mother, Elsa, was a black domestic shorthair. Siegfried and Brunhilde came from different litters, and were used as the foundation pair for the breed. They looked like Russian Blues, but had beautiful long coats. Cobb set out to perfect the trait. The line received new breed status from The International Cat Foundation in 1987, and was accepted for Championship status in 1997.

The lively and affectionate Nebelung is both intelligent and good natured. Although playful, these are mild mannered cats with a gentle disposition. They can be very shy around people they don\u2019t know, but with their owners, they are unfailingly loyal and affectionate. It is common for a Nebelung to attentively follow its human around the house. These cats supervise, but they rarely have much to say, and when they do speak, it\u2019s very softly. A Nebelung is a constant and pleasant companion, but not intrusive or demanding. They will not do well in households with a lot of sudden noises. When startled, a Nebelung becomes something of a gray ghost, and will disappear to parts unknown until it\u2019s sure the coast is clear. The Nebelung is a long, graceful cat in every sense of the word. It\u2019s neck, body, legs, tail, and coat are all long. The vivid green to yellow eyes are slightly oval and decidedly compelling. Large ears top the moderately wedge-shaped head of this sturdy and handsome cat. Well-muscled and strong, the Nebelung is a perfect mix of form and function. Its luxurious blue coat is fine and silky, with elegant silver tipping. Females are heavily ruffed, but males less so. The Nebelung\u2019s tail fur is longer than the hair on his body, he sports fancy pantaloons, and his ears are tufted. It takes a full two years for all that embellished hair to grow out to the right proportions. Nebelungs are lovely blue-gray cats with some silver tipping around the face and paws. Their coats are medium to long and flow beautifully with the line of the cat\u2019s body. Like all long-haired cats, the Nebelung must be brushed and combed on a daily basis to remove dead hair from the coat. This prevents matts and tangles, and helps to distribute natural oils through the fur.

In fact, the breed is so ancient in Norway that these cats appear in the country\u2019s illustrated folklore and mythology. In this Scandinavian country, the breed is called \u201cskogkatt,\u201d which translates literally to \u201cforest cat\u201d (hence the name it is now known by all over the world). This cat breed can boast being stuff of legends- literally- because Norwegian Forest Cat has been mentioned in legends and folktales of Norse fairy mythology. Some of the tales include talk of forest spirits that have taken the form of large cats, and others, such as myths about the Norse goddess of love (and cats!), Freya, mention large cats that pull the chariots the goddess rides. However, it\u2019s not only myths that these big kitties appear in. These cats not only have a history as stalwarts of the Norwegian countryside where they worked as mousers in barns and on farms, but the \u201cskogkatt\u201d also traveled with the Vikings to keep rats from infesting the ships. It is possible that the first Norwegian Forest Cat to reach the United States arrived with Leif Ericson in the late 900s, but there is no way to determine that with certainty. What we do know, for sure, is that the Norwegian Forest Cat was preserved as a breed through efforts in the 20th century. These cats were saved from near extinction after World War II by fanciers, and became a welcome addition to European show rings as well as being named the official cat of Norway. The cats were first exported to America in 1979 and were accepted for full championship status in 1993. Although well adapted for life outside, the modern Norwegian Forest Cat is far from an outdoorsman of the feline world.  Although well adapted for life outside, the modern Norwegian Forest Cat is far from being considered an outdoorsman of the feline world. Despite its name and rugged looks, this cat likes to be at home with his \u201cpeople,\u201d and is even happier if there are other pets in the household. This is great news for those that have multiple pets already- or live in a household that has both a cat and a dog. Norweigan Forest Cat won\u2019t mind company! However, just because the breed is considered generally friendly doesn\u2019t mean that they are needy or clingy. A Norwegian Forest cat will be perfectly happy hanging around in the same room with you, and when you\u2019re busy or away, this kitty will have no problem having fun on its own. They can just as well keep busy by themselves! Even given their capacity for loyalty and affection, the relationship will always be on the cat\u2019s terms, not yours. After all, they are still cats- and felines are as finicky as they come, so you have to play by their rules and not vice versa. In many cases, a Norwegian Forest Cat will choose to be near you rather than on your lap. Ear scratches and petting are just fine, but he probably won\u2019t actively seek them out- this is a laid-back, independent kitty. Another thing to consider is that these are active cats, and they are given to incredible bursts of energy after which they\u2019ll collapse for a deep snooze. A scratching post is essential with a Norwegian Forest Cat. They like to use their claws, and they are no respecters of furniture! Intelligent and sensitive, a Norwegian Forest Cat adapts well to changes in its environment, but on its own schedule. The first thing you will notice about these regal-looking cats is their imposing size. Similar to the Maine Coon, the Norwegian Forest Cat is a lot larger than your average domestic shorthair. However, their uniqueness is not only reserved for their size! The Norwegian Forest Cat has an unusual  appearance due in part to its lovely almond eyes set obliquely in the triangular head. In profile, this cat\u2019s features are straight from brow to nose tip. The tufted ears complete the triangular look, and overall the expression is sweet, but inquisitive. A full ruff in the front gives the Norwegian Forest Cat a somewhat burly chest. The tail and rear britches are bushy and prominent, and the paws are tufted, an adaptation for walking on snow. And, to be honest, they do give Norwegian Forest Cats a particularly cute appearance- the bushy tail of these gorgeous kitties is like a cherry on top of their overall unique physique!  The Norwegian Forest Cat is known for having a brown tabby and white coat, but in truth, almost all colors are seen in this breed in the full range from snow white to coal black. All coat patterns are possible, including sepia and mink categories, but not color pointing. This means that Norwegian Forest Cats can be either solid colored, sport colors common for domestic cats such as ginger or tabby, be multi-colored such as calico, or have unusual smokey-colored coats. In other words, if you have any preference in terms of looks, you\u2019ll be able to find a match within the breed: there\u2019s a Norwegian Forest Cat for any pet owner out there! Nature has outfitted the Norwegian Forest Cat with a waterproof, insulated double coat. The dense undercoat is covered in more coarse guard hairs. Oddly enough, however, this cat requires far less grooming than most long-haired breeds. A weekly combing with more vigorous brushing during the spring shedding season will keep the cat\u2019s coat free of dead hair and prevent matting and tangling.", "facts": " Large-sized cat Families with children and other household pets Affectionate, loyal, playful, active with a gentle nature", "tags": "active, affectionate, loyal, Norway, Norwegian Forest Cat, playful, Vikings, "}, "ocicat": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/ocicat/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ocicat.jpg", "name": "Ocicat", "type": "cat", "text": "The spotted Ocicat is the result of interbreeding the Abyssinian, Siamese, and American Shorthair.

Neither a demanding or clingy cat, the Ocicat loves to be with his humans as much as possible and isn\u2019t above nudging you for a bit of attention. They are unusually sensitive cats, and can show a strong response to being scolded, actually exhibiting a very dog-like shame for being in \u201ctrouble.\u201d They are also receptive to being taught to fetch, sit, heel, and lie down on command, and they are quite agreeable to walking on a leash. They do well with children and other pets, but they don\u2019t like to be left alone for long periods of time. They have a distinctive and happy purr, which they use often and generously, and they are great talkers after the fashion of their Siamese ancestors. Most owners report their Ocicats will actively engage in conversation, answering and commenting with great sincerity, and even following from room to room to get the last word. Since they are highly agile cats, it\u2019s not unusual to find an Ocicat peering down at you from the highest spot in any room. The Ocicat is a big, active athletic animal with a long, elegant body. This solid, well-muscled cat has a short, tight coat that gleams over its well-developed body showing off the elegant spots to their best advantage. Large, pointed ears top their triangular faces and almond eyes stare out with an open, interested expression. An Ocicat\u2019s spots run in rows along his spine from the shoulders to the tail, and are then scattered over the body and down the legs. The spots on the torso are roughly the size of a thumbprint. Most resemble a classic \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. The Ocicat is available in 12 colors and four patterns: ticked, classic tabby, solid, and pointed. Colors include tawny, chocolate, cinnamon, blue, lavender and fawn, and black. Each of those six colors can also be mixed with silver to create the full coat range. Since the Ocicat has such a short, dense coat, he is an extremely low maintenance cat. Most owners simply rub them down once a week or so with a chamois cloth to remove dead hairs and to keep their coats gleaming.", "facts": " Medium to large breed Families with children and other pets.

This breed dates back to 1984 when a tortoiseshell female cat named Cornflower from a feral colony in New Mexico had kittens. Those kittens featured the same intense blue eyes that she had, thereby proving that this unique trait was a dominant trait that could be reproduced. What is interesting about the Ojos Azules cat is the fact that the gene that causes the intense blue eyes does not appear to be linked to any particular coat pattern or color. So you could, for example, have Ojos Azules cats with blue eyes and dark coats. But breeders discovered that dangerous genetic mutations are avoided only when the gene that causes the blue eyes is heterozygous, so the Ojos Azules cats have to be crossed with cats that don\u2019t have the blue eyes in order to help ensure a healthy litter of kittens. In addition to the blue-eyed cats discovered in the United States, a cat with similar characteristics was discovered in Australia, even though no Ojos Azules were imported there. Therefore, breeders think that the mutation might be spontaneous amongst domestic cats. The International Cat Association (TICA) first recognized this breed in 1991, and a few breeders continue working with it today. However, the Ojos Azules cat is considered a rare breed. The most distinctive feature of the Ojos Azules cat has to been its deep blue eyes. Unfortunately, because the Ojos Azules is still a rare breed, not much is known regarding the personality of these cats. The ones that have been bred, however, have been described as affectionate, loyal, friendly, gentle, smart, social, playful, and active. This breed is also considered a lap cat that gets along great with adults, so if you are in search of a loving feline companion that is also stunning in appearance, the Ojos Azules might be a great choice. And, as with all other cats, when Ojos Azules kitties are properly introduced to children and other pets, including other felines, they could get along well with all of them. These cats need a moderate amount of attention, and they also desire to be active, so giving your pet a variety of toys and setting aside some time to play with your pet will help keep him healthy and happy. You might also find that the Ojos Azules cat is moderately vocal as well, so you should find the time to give your pet plenty of affection. Even though the standard for the Ojos Azules cat breed is still in development, the radiant blue eyes are considered the main feature that absolutely has to be present. Also, the coat of these cats will be silky and soft, and the animal will be medium in size with a somewhat triangular shape for the head. The large eyes are round, the tail will be proportionate to the rest of the body, and the neck will be arched. Also, the forehead will be rounded, the nose will have a slight beak, and the muzzle will be angular too. The Ojos Azules cat could feature a variety of coat colors because all colors are allowed. The only exception is solid white, which is not desirable. So, for example, you may find an Ojos Azules that features a bicolor coat, or you might find cats that have tan or blue coats. No matter what, all of the coat colors will end up contrasting in an attractive way with the breed\u2019s stunning blue eyes. And many cats will also feature white patches on their body, such as on the tip of the tail, on the face, and on the feet. The Ojos Azules is considered easy to groom because these cats don\u2019t need to be brushed often and their shedding is considered average. The coat, which could be long or short, is described as silky, soft, fine, and shiny. Therefore, a simple brushing routine could be used to bond with your cat and to help your pet maintain a clean and smooth coat. Plus, brushing your cat regularly could also remove loose hair and help to reduce the incidence of hairballs, so it is worth investing in a comb for your kitty that you can use to massage the skin, stimulate circulation, and smooth out the fur. And, like all other feline breeds, it is also important to get a good pair of claw trimmers for your Ojos Azules cat so that you can regularly trim your pet\u2019s claws.", "facts": " Deep blue eyes Singles, seniors, and families with children and other pets Friendly, active, affectionate", "tags": "blue eyes, deep blue, dominant trait, Ojos Azules Cat, "}, "oriental": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/oriental/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/oriental-cat.jpg", "name": "Oriental", "type": "cat", "text": "The Oriental breed was developed in England in the 1950s.

After many misadventures in trying to name each of these cats, they designation \u201cOriental\u201d was accepted to encompass a breed so large that some 600 color, pattern, and coat length combinations are considered acceptable. These lively, social, and very smart cats are much like their Siamese ancestors, but are available in a much broader range of appearances, and are more slender, angular cats. They did, however, inherit the Siamese gene for talkativeness, and they are definitely people cats. Orientals were first brought to the United States in the 1970s, and were accepted for championship status in 1977. The Oriental is one of the most people-oriented of all cat breeds. The Oriental is one of the most people-oriented of all cat breeds. They don\u2019t just want to share their lives with you, they need to. The Oriental can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d ever be too busy to include him in whatever you\u2019re doing. These cats like to get close and have a good look at the business at hand, whether that\u2019s the screen of your computer, or the food on your plate. They will calmly settle into your lap, purring, and nuzzling against you, and are content to stay that way for hours on end. Orientals are known for greeting their humans at the door, and they are not above scolding you if you get off schedule. They don\u2019t wear a watch, but they might as well because they are so sensitive to time. Both intelligent and curious, they open drawers, dig through purses, and circumvent all barriers when they\u2019re on a quest to find something out. These are not cats who can be left alone, and will actually sink into visible despair when ignored. If you\u2019re up for that much attention seeking, you\u2019ll never find a more devoted, loyal, spirited, and playful feline companion. Regardless of coat length, Orientals are long, graceful cats with a svelte appearance. Their tubular bodies are quite dense and solid. There\u2019s nothing fragile about these cats. The angular head is one of the breed\u2019s most distinctive features. Large ears flare out from the side of the almond-shaped eyes. The pointed muzzle completes an intense, and interested expression with a hint of engaged mystery. Standing on tall, slender legs, the Oriental is a rather artistic cat, naturally sleek by design and truly beautiful. Oriental cats come in a rather dizzying array of 600 color, pattern, and coat lengths. The combinations are endless. As with any cat breed, the grooming requirements for an Oriental depend entirely on coat length. The short-haired varieties need little more than light brushing or rubbing with a chamois. Longer-haired individuals should be combed or brushed.

Out of all of the offspring, she picked the best bicolor kitties to then mate back to Orientals or Siamese. In 1983, the breed was recognized by TICA (The International Cat Association). Throughout the 1980s, breeders in Europe (the Netherlands and France, in particular) also started an Oriental Bicolor breeding program. They used a white and red Moroccan female street cat and later used a black and white Cornish Rex. More cats were then imported from the United States, as the goal was to establish different lines to mate a bicolor cat with another bicolor cat and create a coat that had the right proportion of white in it, all while avoiding excessive inbreeding. In 2004, Oriental Bicolor cats were imported into the United Kingdom. By 2008, the breed received Provisional Status with the GCCF (The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy), as the breed became popular rather quickly. Oriental Bicolor kitties are known for their outgoing, social, and affectionate personality. Oriental Bicolor kitties are known for their outgoing, social, and affectionate personality. They are intelligent and active cats that need to have plenty of interaction with their human family members, as they prefer to be the center of attention. It is also a great idea to give your Oriental Bicolor cat a range of toys to play with in order to prevent boredom and keep him physically active and mentally stimulated. These curious and talkative felines will get along with everyone, including other cats, pets, and children, so they make ideal family companions. One of the first things that you will notice when you look at an Oriental Bicolor is its pointed or angular face. When you observe these cats from the front, you will notice that they have a triangular face shape, along with an expression that is intelligent and alert. And when observed from the side, the nose of the Oriental Bicolor should be straight, while the chin is strong and features a level bite. The tip of the cat\u2019s nose will line up with the tip of the chin as well. The eyes will slant towards the cat\u2019s nose, and they will be Oriental in terms of their shape. The ears will be wide at the base, the neck will be slender and long, and the coat will be glossy and sleek. The body, which should be balanced and proportionate throughout, will be slender and long, but the cat will be medium in size overall. The feet and legs will be fine, and the tail will be long, slender, and tapering as well. An Oriental Bicolor should feature white fur over 1/3 of his body. The paws and face should also be white. Beyond that, these kitties can feature a wide range of beautiful colors and patterns. These colors and patterns could include black, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, cream, apricot, cinnamon, caramel, fawn, tortie, smoke, tabby, point, and shaded. The eyes, too, can come in several shades. They can be blue or green, and some cats might have one blue eye and one green eye. An Oriental Bicolor could have a short and fine coat that is close lying and glossy, or the coat could be medium-long, silky, glossy, and fine, lacking a wooly undercoat. A weekly brushing session is all you really need to help keep your Oriental Bicolor looking his best. This will help remove loose fur easily and also give your cat the attention that he craves. Just keep in mind that, because this breed has a thin coat, you should brush your pet gently.

Persians are the most popular of all cat breeds. They have gentle dispositions to match their sweet faces, and the capacity to blend into almost any household once they have become accustomed to their surroundings. Persians are very much creatures of habit. Quiet cats with soft voices, they will even do well with households full of boisterous children once a routine has been established, but their natural preference is for more serene surroundings. Their stature does not make them especially active cats, but they are \u201cposers.\u201d A Persian cat always seems to know where they look the best, and that\u2019s where they place themselves, almost as if they\u2019re attempting to improve the look of the room. They make for close and loving companions, and respond delightfully to attention, giving their affections openly and sweetly. For these reasons, they make especially lovely pets for older, retired individuals. Persians have short, stocky legs to support their equally short and broad bodies, which are \u201ccobby.\u201d Their overall chunkiness does not make Persians disposed to either jumping or climbing. The sweetness of expression associated with this breed is due in part to the large, round eyes and the cat\u2019s short, flat nose.

Without question, a Persian is a strictly indoor cat. They have gorgeous long, flowing coats that must be maintained on a daily basis using both metal combs and brushes. It\u2019s a constant challenge to remove dead hair, and to stay ahead of mats and tangles. Fortunately they require only the rare bath.

In 1994, a hairless breed known as the Donskoy was bred with the Oriental Shorthair. Because it became really popular in Saint Petersburg, Russia, the name Peterbald was given to this new and unique cat breed. The Peterbald is a new hairless cat breed that originated in Russia in the early part of the 1990s. These cats are renowned for their dog-like loyalty toward their human companions. They are highly affectionate, loving, and social, and they will also often follow their owners around the house to stay near them as much as possible. They crave attention and interaction with their human family on a consistent basis, often waiting for their owners to come home and being very vocal to communicate with their favorite people. Peterbalds are outgoing, friendly, curious, trusting, and playful. They get along well with other cats, as well as children and pets of other species. And they are even willing to meet and become friends with strangers. The Peterbald typically has no fur, but some members of the breed do have a short, fuzzy coat that somewhat resembles cashmere. Other distinctive features include almond shaped eyes and large, pointed ears that resemble those of a bat (both of these features were actually inherited from the Oriental Shorthair). These cats also have slender, long bodies, and their heads are shaped like inverted triangles. And because they are hairless, you will also notice a lot of wrinkles on their bodies. While hairlessness is often the most sought-after quality of these cats, they can also come in other coat textures, such as chamois, velour, brush, and straight. In fact, depending on the genetics of the parents of a litter of Peterbalds, some kittens can be bald, while others can have straight, full coats. Kittens can also change the type of coat they sport as they age, with hair being lost, gained, or altered in texture for up to the first two years. Ultra bald cats will be hairless and will not have any eyebrows or whiskers. Chamois will be roughly 90% hairless, with kinked eyebrows and whiskers. Velour cats will be roughly 70% bald and feature a coat that is as high as 1mm in length. Brush Peterbalds will sport wiry hair that can be as high as 5mm in length with a wavy or curly texture and kinked whiskers. Finally, straight coats have close-lying and short coats, along with straight whiskers. And some Peterbalds can even have a combination of these coat types. The Peterbald breed comes in all colors. Because the Peterbald is a hairless cat, a strict skincare routine is necessary to keep these felines healthy. For example, if you bring your cat into the great outdoors with you, apply a feline-safe sunscreen to its skin. You also need to take steps to protect this cat from the cold because of its lack of fur.

Even in an emaciated condition, the stray weighed 17 pounds and was as tall as Brewer\u2019s knee. The male mated with a brown spotted female that lived next door to Brewer. One of the kittens, Pixie, became the foundation for the breed that was developed over the next couple of years.

When Josephine gave birth to a litter, the kittens were unusually friendly, as were a second batch of offspring born sometime later. This fact came to the attention of cat breeder Ann Baker, who bought several of the cats and set out to create a new breed. Circumventing the usual channels, Baker trademarked the \u201cRagdoll\u201d name and established the International Ragdoll Association (IRCA). It was only when two groups of breeders broke away from the IRCA that the name \u201cRagamuffin\u201d began to be used due to Baker\u2019s trademark. The bloodlines of the rogue groups were mixed with Persians, Himalayans, and other domestic longhaired cats to bolster genetic strength and to increase the Ragamuffin\u2019s degree of distinction from the Ragdoll. Ragamuffins were accepted as a recognized breed by the American Cat Fancier\u2019s Association and the Cat Fancier\u2019s Association in 2003, advancing to the Championship Class in 2011.

These cats are not particularly athletic, although they are fun and playful. They like to scamper up their scratching posts, and can be induced to run after a toy if you don\u2019t get carried away with the whole idea. Generally a Ragamuffin will greet you at the door and then follow you around the house ready to hear about your day without being insistent. This is not to say the Ragamuffin isn\u2019t vocal, but they aren\u2019t raucous.

Broad-chested with solid, rectangular bodies, they have broad, wedge-like heads supported by a short neck. The round forehead dips noticeably to the nose.

The coat on the sides and along the stomach is of a medium to medium long length and soft to the touch. Ragamuffins come in all colors and coat patterns, but the CFA standards do not allow colorpoint variations. All solid eye colors are present, with some individuals having two eyes of different shades. Although all cats with long hair benefit from combing and brushing, the Ragamuffin is surprisingly easy in terms of maintenance. Their coat is plush and thick, but it does not mat easily.

Established cat breeder Ann Baker bought some of the kittens and set out to create a docile breed, which she trademarked as the Ragdoll. (Interestingly, Baker was convinced the cats had been the subject of secret government experiments at the University of California where Josephine recovered after having been injured in a car accident. She thought their docility was a result of those experiments.) Baker circumvented the normal avenues for breed development, and founded the International Ragdoll Association to enforce especially strict breeding standards.

Because of their extremely trusting and non-combative nature, Ragdolls don\u2019t always know what\u2019s safe or good for them. They must be strictly indoor cats for their own protection. Obviously they are gentle, affectionate, and intelligent cats, if not possessed with particularly good judgement. They are, however, very lovable, and incredibly easy to handle. Ragdolls are one of the biggest of all domestic cats. They are sturdy, with large frames and well proportioned legs. In addition to the distinctive point coloration, they always have blue eyes. For show cats, the more intense the eye color the better. Interestingly, they shed less than might be suspected because they do not have a thick undercoat. Most of their long hair is encompassed by long, outer guard hairs. Mitted Ragdolls with white feet and white chins were first allowed in the 2008-2009 show season. They are often confused with Birmans, but the latter have colored chins. There are six accepted colors for Ragdolls: seal, chocolate, flame, blue, lilac, and cream. Every Ragdoll kitten is born white, and begin to exhibit their coat color within 8-10 weeks. Full coloration is not finalized until 2-4 years. The four accepted patterns are Pointed, Mitted, Bicolor, and Lynx. The soft, \u201crabbit like\u201d fur of the Ragdoll is surprisingly impervious to matting. Shedding and the corollary problem of hairballs are easily mitigated by regular combing and brushing, which the Ragdolls love. This is even more important during the spring, when shedding naturally increases as the cats lose their winter coats. Wide-toothed steel combs work well and should be used daily.

These cats were a so-called landrace or a naturally occurring breed. Naturally, people quickly fell in love with this cat\u2019s regal looks and unique coloring, so it wasn\u2019t long before they started breeding them. In the beginning, the Russian Blue could only be found in Russia (hence the name), but it caught the eye of enthusiasts from other countries. The Russian Blue Cat was brought by sailors from the Archangel Isles to England and Northern Europe in the 1860s. It was there where the breed was first shown outside of its native country- in the Crystal Palace in 1875. The breed was enrolled in competition with other blue-haired breeds and it wasn\u2019t given its own class until a few decades later.  The Russian Blue Cat was given official breed status in 1912. After World War II, this breed was further developed in Russia and Scandinavia. Because of the breed\u2019s scarcity before and after this time, the Russian Blue was bred with the Siamese cat. The Russian Blues seen in America today are a result of combining the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian and English Russian Blues, and as a result, the Siamese traits have been largely bred out. Today, the Russian Blue is a popular and common cat breed, despite being on the verge of dying out after the two world wars ended. All major cat registries and organizations recognize this breed and it is one of the most treasured pet cat breeds in the world.  The Russian Blue Cat is good with children and other pets, and is generally gentle, quiet and shy in nature.  The Russian Blue Cat is good with children and other pets, and is generally gentle, quiet and shy in nature. This breed is intuitive to its owners\u2019 moods and will actively seek affection, making it a wonderful cuddle buddy. Despite their sweet temperament, though, these cats are somewhat independent and reserved towards strangers. They might be all about ear scratches and purring when they\u2019re with their close family, but when guests come over, your cuddly cat will likely hide out and wait until they are gone. Even though they were once interbred with the talkative Siamese, these lovely cats are far from vocal today. They won\u2019t be meowing at your for every little thing or express their displeasure with loud sounds. Their quiet disposition is just one of the many things that makes them perfect for prospective pet pawrents who want an easy-going cat. They are not clingy as some breeds, Ragdolls for instance, and their desire for affection and attention won\u2019t be overwhelming or demanding. You won\u2019t have to worry that your kitty will grow depressed while you\u2019re at work- as long as their needs are met. The Russian Blue is an intelligent, curious cat that will get bored. Instead of finding out that when your pet starts running at super speed at 3 AM or starts using your sofa as a scratch pad, provide proper stimulation and enrichment on time. Interactive cat toys, such as feather teasers or lasers, will keep your pet entertained and deepen the bond you have. When they\u2019re alone, they can be occupied with a puzzle toy- it will keep those impressive brains in good shape and protect your prized possessions from boredom-induced damage.  As a kitten, the Russian Blue is playful and active, but as it grows older, it prefers familiar settings and will not want to venture outdoors. As this cat ages, its activity level will decrease and will want to spend more time curled in your lap. A Russian Blue Cat can live past 15 years of age The Russian Blue has bright green eyes, two layers of short, thick fur, and a blue-gray coat. This medium-sized cat has a double coat, with a soft and downy undercoat and a fine topcoat, giving it a plush, soft, and silky feel. The base color is a silver-blue, although some lighter or darker patches may present throughout the coat. Fine boned and long bodied, the breed boats a graceful appearance that is balanced. Overall, this cat should look as if it is in good physical condition with firm muscle tone and an attentive attitude. Its ears are large, with wide bases that are set on the sides of the medium wedge-shaped head, somewhat far apart. It has a medium thick tail that is covered in soft, short fur. The Russian Blue Cat\u2019s coat is its most distinctive characteristic, thanks to its solid blue color and the tips of the guard hairs coated in silver, giving it a shimmering effect. There should be no other color markings on the coat \u2013 however, some cats display a white locket on the throat (which disqualifies it from shows). Finally, this breed sports mauve footpads, completing its unique look. The Russian Blue is not a demanding breed when it comes to grooming. They have thick, short coats that don\u2019t shed overly and are not prone to matting or tangling. To make sure those recognizable silver-blue hairs look lustrous and stay soft, brush or comb your pet at least once (ideally twice) a week. In the spring, when all cats shed more than usual as they discard that winter fluff, your Russian Blue will need more frequent brushing. This will help remove loose hair before it ends up all over your clothes and furniture. In addition to brushing, Russian Blue needs regular nail trimming and teeth brushing- no different than any other cat breed.

Judy Frank, a breeder of Bengals located in Pennsylvania, is credited with the first such pairing when she bred a male serval to a Siamese in 1986. Concerted efforts to develop the breed gained traction in the early 1990s due to the efforts of Patrick Kelley, who bought one of the kittens from Frank\u2019s initial experiment. Breeder Joyce Sroufe helped Kelley develop the breed, and the proposed breed standard. The cats were accepted as a new breed by The International Cat Association in 2001, and were granted championship status in 2012. The early popularity of the Savannah has taken the cat world by storm, and there are now some 60 breeders worldwide.

Savannahs make excellent companions and are surprisingly receptive and convivial with other pets in the house. Known for their friend \u201chead bump\u201d greetings, Savannahs are often found in the highest places they can reach. These cats are serious jumpers! They can leap approximately 8 feet from a sitting position with no warning. They simply burst upward like elegantly coiled springs. Savannahs love to play in water, and have something of a good natured sense of humor. They are quite adept at opening doors and cupboards, so child locks are a must when one of these cats is in the house. Extremely loyal, they have many \u201cdog like\u201d characteristics, including a willingness to be leashed, and to play fetch. They are known to wag their tails, and to fluff out their tail fur as a sign of greeting. In terms of vocalizations, a Savannah can either chirp or meow, and occasionally do something in between. The breed also lets out with a hiss like that of a loud snake that can be highly disconcerting until you get used to the sound. Tall and lean, the Savannah owes much of its physique to its wild antecedents. Officially the largest domestic cat, the Savannah\u2019s conformation makes it look much larger than it really is, but some individuals do reach as much as 30 lbs. The cat\u2019s long neck and long legs give it a graceful ranginess augmented by the stunning coat marked with black spots and bars on a tawny, golden background. Typically, these cats are about half the size of the wild Serval cat, which is approximately 40 pounds. Savannahs have wonderfully erect, black barred ears, and very prominent shoulders. Their eyes can be green, gold, or brown, but at birth, they are blue. Overall, the appearance of the breed is one of intelligent alertness with an aura of mysterious aloofness that is a complete front for a cat known for its high level of loyal devotion to its humans. The Savannah\u2019s primary coat is a warm golden to tawny color covered in distinctive dark spots and bars. Savannah\u2019s are incredibly easy to groom.

Ross asked the owner of the farm for one of the kittens, whom he named Susie. She was a white barn cat who became the founder of the Scottish Fold breed. Her ears folded forward and down, giving her an expression that has, by turns, been described as looking like an owl, a Teddy bear, or a \u201cpixie.\u201d Regardless of the descriptive chosen, it\u2019s almost impossible not to be charmed by a Scottish Fold. The breed caught on rapidly in the United States, and gained championship status with The Cat Fancier\u2019s Association in 1978. Initially the long-haired variant was known as the Highland Fold, but that designation was dropped in 1992 and now short and long-haired Scottish folds compete as one breed in different divisions. The Scottish Fold is a hardy cat, doing justice to the breed\u2019s working class origins. The Scottish Fold is a hardy cat, doing justice to the breed\u2019s working class origins. They have very small, soft voices and in general \u201cspeak\u201d only rarely. Although quiet, they are adoringly devoted to their people and highly adaptable to almost any living situation. They tolerate other animals and children well, but they do just fine with a single person. Folds don\u2019t tend to overreact to new surroundings, which makes them an ideal show cat. There are two types of Scottish Fold: folded ear and \u201cnormal\u201d or straight ear. The operative word with these cats is \u201cround.\u201d In body conformation the Fold is a medium-sized cat with a well-padded body. Their eyes are full and circular, well spaced, and sweetly expressive. The look is completed by their thick, round whisker pads and short nose which, in profile is gently curved. Kittens are born with upright ears which begin to fold at three to four weeks, a process that should be complete by 12 weeks. The Scottish Fold can be either a short or long-haired cat and is found in a wide range of coat colorations. The colors lilac and chocolate are not allowed in the breed, however, and neither is Siamese-like colorpointing. The most common colorations are solids and tabby patterns without without white markings. Eye colors include green, blue-green, and gold in solid coats; blue and copper in cats with tabby markings; and odd eyes in bi-colors, vans, and whites. Grooming needs are based entirely on coat length, with longer-haired varieties needed combing and brushing to keep dead hair out of the coat to avoid mats and tangles. It is important to get a Scottish Fold accustomed to having its ears cleaned from an early age. The top of the ear has to be drawn gently upward to gain access to the opening, which will need to be wiped out periodically. Only the visible surfaces are cleaned, and the cat\u2019s ears should be routinely checked by a veterinary professional for any sign of parasites or infection.", "facts": " Rounded face, folded ears Families with children and other pets, as well as singles.

The very first Scottish Fold was a barn cat whose name was Susie.

Today, the Scottish Straight is known for its wonderful personality and temperament. The Scottish Straight is one of the feline breeds that make up the Scottish Breed Group, along with the beloved Scottish Fold. The Scottish Straight, like the Scottish Fold, is known for its inquisitiveness, loyalty, and intelligence. These cats are not typically shy, as they would much prefer always being around you, perhaps even following you from one room to the next throughout your home. Despite enjoying being around people, these cats generally do not like being carried or picked up, and they do have a bit of an independent side that makes them comfortable being near you but still being able to do their own thing. Therefore, they make great pets for those who are searching for a cat that will be devoted without being too clingy to their human family. Because these cats are so smart, you can even train them to do tricks or play fetch. And, in addition to their playfulness, this breed is also known for being quiet and laidback. These cats will even get along great with other pets and with children. Scottish Folds and Scottish Straights can either be longhaired or shorthaired, and they can all be born within the same litter. The only difference is that the Scottish Straight\u2019s ears will remain upright, like other cat breeds, while the Scottish Fold\u2019s ears will eventually fold forward and downward. Ultimately, though, the Folds and the Straights have the same personality and structural features. This breed features a round face, round body, and round eyes, making it really cute. The body is medium sized and medium boned. Scottish Straights come in a variety of patterns and colors, including all of those in the Pointed and Traditional Divisions. These include tabby, bicolor, particolor, tabby and white, and solid. Also, every eye color is possible, though copper is the most common. The grooming needs of a Scottish Straight will pretty much depend upon the length of the coat. So, for example, a longhaired Scottish Straight would need to be brushed more frequently and on a regular basis. This consistent grooming routine will remove dead hair and prevent tangles and matting. Shorthaired Scottish Straights, on the other hand, could still benefit from a simple weekly brushing in order to prevent hairballs and to reduce shedding. However, there isn\u2019t as much of a risk of the fur actually getting tangled or matted as there is with a longhaired cat.", "facts": " Medium build, round features Any cat loving household, including singles, families with other pets, and families with children Friendly, intelligent, laidback, playful, social", "tags": "longhair cats, round face, Scottish Fold, Scottish Straight, shorthair cats, straight ears, "}, "selkirk rex": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/selkirk-rex/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/selkirk-rex.jpg", "name": "Selkirk Rex", "type": "cat", "text": "The Selkirk Rex is a new breed that developed naturally from a curly coated tortie and white housecat found in a shelter in Montana in 1987.

From birth, the whiskers are also curly and have a tendency to break off when they get too long. There is no change in either the coat or whiskers as the cat ages. The least amount of curl is typically seen down the back. These cats are both sturdy and very healthy. Virtually every combination of color and pattern is acceptable for this breed including colorpoint. The coat should curl randomly rather than have any distinctive pattern. Since both long and short haired versions of the Selkirk Rex are present, grooming is dependent on coat length. The curly coat should not be brushed all that often, and shampoos could be chosen that do not leave any coating on the fur.

This conservation biologist wanted to create a new domestic cat breed that would appear much like the gorgeous African Serval, which is a wild cat.

Instead, these cats were developed by crossing Oriental Shorthairs with Bengals, giving them a wild appearance without the wild tendencies. The Serengeti cat looks much like the gorgeous African Serval. These cats make wonderful family pets because they can get along with just about everyone.

Descriptions and illustrations that fit the distinct looks of what we today know as Siamese cats have been found in ancient manuscripts dated 14 to 18 century Thailand. The exotic beauty and unique character of the Siamese cats made sure, however, that the breed found its way to other parts of the world. In the late 1800s, the first Siamese cats arrived in the West, first in the United States of America where a Siamese was a gift for the president of the country, and somewhat later to the United Kingdom and beyond, mostly through diplomats that have been stationed in Thailand. Since their initial exportation from Siam (now Thailand) in the 1800s, the Siamese has been winning the hearts and running the lives of the people who love this ancient breed. These cats are thought to be the descendants of the temple cats of Siam, and thus have an air of \u201csacredness\u201d about their origin. To be fair, their stunning looks and exceptional temperament don\u2019t hurt their centuries-long popularity. either. Acutely intelligent and highly inquisitive, there are few cats who exhibit the degree of loving devotion seen in the Siamese.  Acutely intelligent and highly inquisitive, there are few cats who exhibit the degree of loving devotion seen in the Siamese, but be warned. These cats have a tendency to bond deeply with one person for life. Once that bonding is complete, the Siamese is there to advise you \u2014 vocally \u2014 on every aspect of your life. (Unfortunately, they can also take a dislike to some member of the family or to one of your acquaintances and be quite obvious in their disdain- they are not shy about showing their feelings, good or bad.)  Siamese cats are legendary for their voices, that caterwaul across the range from gentle chirps to outright shrieks. If a Siamese has something to say, he will be heard. These are highly social cats that do not like to be left alone, a fact they will share with the neighbors at the top of their lungs if you \u201cabandon\u201d them for too many hours at a stretch. The Siamese is also a very high-energy cat who is on the go from the start of his busy day until they decide it\u2019s quitting time. At that point, they will happily settle in bed, but they are just as likely to serve as an insistent alarm clock for their humans equipped with an agenda in mind. If you are looking to get a Siamese cat as your companion, you should be aware that this breed is considered generally more demanding and more aggressive than other cat breeds. This relates to their territoriality and relationships with other cats in particular, so if the other kitties in the home are not to your Siamese liking and their personalities don\u2019t match, the Siamese will not hesitate to express their dislike. Similarly, their neediness can make them moody and even mean- they know what they want and don\u2019t care how they go about it- but a lot will depend on their upbringing. If you neglect their needs and fail to create a nurturing environment for your Siamese, their behavior can take a turn for the worse- so make sure that you are pampering your kitty as she deserves.  The Siamese is a sleek lined, small to medium sized cat with aristocratic and well-defined features. Their almond-shaped eyes are a deep blue, and beautifully contrasting colors mark the \u201cpoints\u201d of their silky, short coats. Their heads are wedge-shaped and long, topping tubular, muscular bodies supported by fine, graceful legs. Both the tail and neck are elegant, creating the breed\u2019s overall pleasingly linear profile. The profile is totally straight, and the chin especially well aligned. Large, thin ears complete the wedge shape of the head. Once known for both kinked tails and crossed eyes, those traits were seen as a fault, and have been largely eliminated through careful selective breeding. The best recognized of the Siamese colors is the Seal Point, with its pale fawn body and striking black extremities. In 1934 the blue point gained CFA recognition, followed by the lilac point in 1955. There is also a chocolate point, although that variation appears less frequently. Currently, however, color pointing in the Siamese can be found in the following shades: Seal, Chocolate, Blue, Lilac, Cinnamon, Fawn, Red, Cream, Apricot, and Carmel. The points can additionally be patterned with Tabby or Tortie patterning. The tight, glossy coat is short and fine, adhering close to the body and requiring little in the way of special care. Unlike long-haired cat breeds, the Siamese won\u2019t require hours and hours of meticulous brushing and untangling of the hair knots and mats. Many owners find that nothing more is required than a good rub down with a chamois cloth to remove loose hairs from the coat, a process the convivial Siamese enjoys enormously. Still, every cat should be brushed a few times a week to minimize shedding and to maintain a healthy coat, so don\u2019t skimp on the beauty routine even if your kitty\u2019s coat is amongst those considered low maintenance. In addition to caring for the coat, you should also make sure that the grooming of your precious pet includes oral care and neat nails. The nails should be regularly trimmed or filed down, not just to protect your furniture and legs of unsuspecting passersby, but to prevent potentially painful conditions such as torn or broken nails. Similarly, your cat\u2019s teeth should be regularly cleaned- even though they\u2019ll most likely protest. Brush their teeth with special cat-friendly toothpaste and toothbrush at least once or twice a week and take your pet to regular vet check-ups to make sure that any plaque buildup is dealt with in time before it causes teeth loss and other issues.", "facts": " Slim muscled body Families with children but often bonds with one person.

It is also a characteristic of this breed that they love water. Start a Siberian on a schedule of baths at a young age, and they will not complain about the process later in life.

In the late 1980s irregularities surfaced in the paperwork the Meadows filled out to bring the first three Singapuras to the U.S. There has been speculation that the first cats were actually a Burmese/Abyssinian cross. The CFA, however, found no evidence that the Singapura is not a natural breed, however DNA testing done in 2007 found few genetic differences between the Singapura and the Burmese. None of that, however, detracts from the absolute charm of these small but thoroughly delightful cats. The Singapura is such a charming extrovert, playful in a nondestructive way, and delightfully curious, it\u2019s hard to lose patience with him. There is no way to describe this active, involved people cat without using words like \u201cpesky\u201d and \u201cpest.\u201d However, a Singapura is such a charming extrovert, playful in a nondestructive way, and delightfully curious, it\u2019s hard to lose patience with him. After all, he\u2019s not doing anything but showing you how to run your life the right way \u2014 his way. These cats retain their alert and interactive qualities well into old age, and they learn. The active intelligence for which the Singapura is known is ever evident in those engaged and probing eyes. If you can\u2019t keep up with a feline CEO who knows only one speed \u2014 full out \u2014 then a Singapura is not for you. A smaller than average, shorthaired cat with big ears and eyes, the Singapura closely resembles the Abyssinian in appearance. On closer inspection, these cats have a distinctive light beige coloration reminiscent of the coat of a cougar. Muscular and compact, they have small feet and a normal length tail. Their eyes can be yellow, hazel, or green. Slow to develop, a Singapura does not reach its full size until sometime between 15 and 24 months. Because of their small size, it\u2019s difficult to get a Singapura of show quality, and many wind up being sold as pets \u2014 a job for which they are uniquely suited and at which they endlessly excel. For the most part the Singapura\u2019s pattern is a ticked tabby. Typically the chin, muzzle and chest are lighter. Only one color is recognized, sepi agouti, which is officially described as \u201cdark brown ticking on a warm old ivory ground color.\u201d The Singapura has a short, shiny coat. Fine in texture, it lies flat against the body and requires little in the way of grooming. A chamois cloth or just your hands will help to keep dead hair out of the coat, and the Singapura so loves attention, he will be completely on board with the process.

This is an experimental and rare hybrid dwarf cat breed whose development began in United States in the 1990s. Breeder Roy Galusha was the first person to start crossing the Munchkin cat, which is a dwarf breed, with the LaPerm, which is known for its lovely curly coat and its intelligence. The result was a new adorable cat breed that featured curly hair on a small body, so more breeders stepped in to continue working on the development of this breed. Because these kitties are bred to be characteristically small, it is important to find a reputable breeder if you are interested in introducing a Skookum into your family. Doing so will help ensure the health of your little cat. Thanks to its short stature, endearing personality, and curly fur, the Skookum is playfully referred to as the Shirley Temple of the feline world. Skookum cats are known for their happy-go-lucky, calm, and confident personality. They are intelligent, athletic, and sweet, and they make wonderful family pets for those who are searching for an active cat who will be glad to spend time in your lap as well as amuse you with his fun-loving nature. These playful, energetic, and curious kitties thoroughly enjoy spending time with people, so you should ensure that you have enough time to devote to this cat before bringing one home. Skookums, who have been described as remaining kitten-like even into adulthood, will gladly show you loads of affection, especially when they are given plenty of love in return. The Skookum cat is one of several dwarf feline breeds, so it will feature shorter bones than normal sized cats. While females will typically weigh anywhere from 3-5 lbs, males can weigh anywhere from 5-7 lbs. Either way, the Skookum will only weigh about half the size of your average adult kitty. In addition to being a lightweight companion, the Skookum cat is also short and stocky, and you will notice that the front legs are shorter than the cat\u2019s hind legs. This stature causes these cats to remain lower to the ground. However, when bred properly, the body structure should not inhibit the cat\u2019s ability to quickly and easily get around like any other kitty. Overall, the body and the neck of a Skookum cat will appear thick, and the chest is rounded. The body also has good musculature, and it will not look elongated. Also, the feet will be compact and rounded. Another distinguishing feature is the Skookum\u2019s curly coat, and females may have looser curls within their fur compared with males. The coat could range from short to long, and it can be described as having a light and airy, as well as soft, texture. Even the eyebrows and whiskers are curled, giving this cat a truly unique look. Also, the luxurious looking tail can be described as having a pom-pom on the end. It tapers from the base to a rounded tip, and it is considered plumed because the fur is thick and fluffy. These kitties also feature pointed, large ears on a broad, modified wedge-shaped head that features rounded contours. The eyes are described as walnut shaped, and they are medium to large in size, making them appear expressive. A Skookum\u2019s coat can feature a range of patterns and colors, such as bicolor, solid, and colorpoint. Despite the Skookum\u2019s curly fur, it is not hard at all to groom this lovely cat. Your pet will love to be pampered and brushed, and the texture of the fur actually makes it easy to get the job done. To keep your kitty\u2019s coat looking and feeling fabulous, you can brush him twice a week. But you can certainly gently brush him more often, especially since this is a great way to bond with your attention-seeking cat.

The Snowshoe received \u201cexperimental breed\u201d status from both the Cat Fanciers Federation (CFF) and the American Cat Association (ACA) in 1974.

In testament to their Siamese heritage, the Snowshoe is quite vocal when they have a complaint to register. Thankfully they are not as loud as a Siamese, but they still make themselves heard. The Snowshow is intelligent, and deft with its paws, learning quickly how to open any type of door. They are receptive to learning tricks, and like to play in running water. Some individuals will even swim. Overall, they are active cats with a fondness for finding the highest spot in the room as their personal observation post. The Snowshow is a medium to large cat with beautiful blue eyes, a pointed coat, and white markings on legs and paws. They can have either a triangular or \u201capple\u201d head, with medium to large ears rounded slightly at the tips. The tail is medium in length. The overall effect is a pleasingly solid cat with a definite Siamese look, but in a somewhat fuller, and rounder form. These cats are, however, every bit as muscular and athletic as their Siamese ancestors. A Snowshoe can have a variety of coat colors, but must have the distinctive white feet and other white markings, which are typically on the stomach, chest, and face in addition to the paws. Since the breed is new and unique, its standards vary by registry. Popular colors include blue, lilac, lynx, fawn, chocolate, and seal points. Snowshoe cats have a medium to short coat that is smooth and bright. There is little undercoat, so although these cats do shed seasonally, the amount of loose hair is not excessive.

He was mated back to his mother to produce another \u201cnaked\u201d offspring. These cats were purchased by Ridyadh Bawa. He and his mother, Yania, a Siamese breeder, and Kees and Rita Tenhoves, used the cats to develop the Sphynx. They gained and then lost provisional breed showing status in 1971 when the CFA ruled that an insufficient gene pool existed and no consistent standard was present. From there, the development of the breed relied on Mother Nature and the work of many people who identified and placed hairless cats with various breeders. Thanks to selective outcrossing with American Shorthairs and the Devon Rex, the Sphynx gene pool has broadened. In the 1990s, sufficient numbers of these cats appeared for their popularity to grow.

These cats can also display the following patterns on their skin: tabby, mackerel, spotted, patched, tortoiseshell, calico, and bi-color. Some Sphynx even display color pointing. Although the Sphynx is a hairless cat, they do have grooming and maintenance requirements. Normally, a cat\u2019s hair absorbs the oils that build up on its skin.

Judy Sugden began developing the Toyger in the late 1980s, and part of her goal in creating the breed was to raise awareness for tiger conservation. She crossed a Bengal with a striped Domestic Shorthair to produce a cat that looks very much like a wild tiger but has the friendly disposition of a domesticated house cat. A street cat from India was also used in the breeding process because of its markings. After many years, the Toyger breed was finally registered in 2000.

This breed is friendly and enjoys the company of its human family, so consider getting other pets if you want to ensure your Toyger will never get lonely when you are not home. Toygers are also alert, active, athletic, and outgoing. They even like playing with water like wild tigers. And they are intelligent as well, so they are easy to train, whether you want your Toyger to learn how to walk on a leash, play fetch, or perform tricks.

Cat puzzle toys that stimulate the mind are also great at keeping these smart cats entertained. Overall, these cats are sweet, laidback, and easygoing, making them great companions for any cat loving family, including those with children and other pets. In addition to their tiger-like appearance and muscular build, Toyger cats have short legs, so their bodies remain lower to the ground when compared to many other cat breeds. And they also feature elongated toes, which give them a tiger-like gait. Plus, they have high shoulders, a rectangular and long body, and big bones. The Toyger\u2019s most distinctive feature is its coat, which is plush, dense, short, and soft. The eyes have deep hues of gold through green. The Toyger breed is known for its gorgeous deep orange or tan fur with black vertical stripes that can be branched or broken and that resemble those of a wild tiger. Because they have such a plush and dense coat, it is necessary to brush Toygers regularly, as this will help remove loose hairs, reduce shedding, and prevent hairballs. However, they are generally low-maintenance cats that will gladly keep themselves clean, so you do not need to worry about bathing them unless necessary. A weekly brushing should be enough to keep the Toyger\u2019s coat soft, smooth, shiny, and healthy, and it is a great way to bond with these cats, who enjoy getting attention from their human family.

There may be a genetic link to the Manul cat, a wild feline domesticated by the Tartars. The Turkish Angora is a pure and natural breed, which has a written history dating back to France in the 16th century. In the early 1900s, the Turkish Angora was used heavily in Persian breeding programs, and was in danger of disappearing as a distinct breed until rescued by enthusiasts in carefully controlled breeding programs in Turkey. The cat was introduced in America in the 1950s, but all Turkish Angoras must be able to trace their ancestry back to Turkey to qualify for registration. The Turkish Angora has an outstanding reputation for being not only intelligent but highly adaptable.

Playful and loving, these cats do extremely well with children but are also lively and fun companions for older singles who might otherwise be alone. Turkish Angoras are accepting of dogs, although they will quickly establish themselves as the boss of the household. Inquisitive and welcoming by nature, these are not the kinds of cats to hide under the bed when company comes over. They like to be right in the middle of whatever is going on. The Turkish Angora is an elegant cat with fine bones and long legs. They are well muscled and athletic, and capable of terrific feats of jumping and climbing. The ears have a good amount of fur, and are fairly large, always held at an upright and alert angle. These cats have blue, green, yellow, or amber eyes, and it\u2019s possible for odd-eyed combinations to appear. Regardless of color, the almond-shaped eyes are always expressive and sweet. A Turkish Angora carries his plumed coat upright in a confident manner, holding it perpendicular to his back. Everything about the build and posture of the Turkish Angora speaks of an alert and engaged presence, as if the cat has walked into the room and announced, \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d White remains the most popular color in the Turkish Angora breed, but there has been an increasing emphasis on broadening the color base. Solid colors are now present in cream, red, blue, and black, with tortoiseshell, spotted tabby, mackerel, and bi-color patterning. Smoked and shaded colors are under development, but lavender, chocolate, and colorpoints are not acceptable. The Turkish Angora\u2019s silky coat is soft, but need only be combed once or twice a week. Either a fine-toothed metal comb or a slicker brush works extremely well with this breed to remove loose hair. More frequent combing is required in the spring and summer to stay ahead of seasonal shedding, which will also cut down on the number of hairballs. The Turkish Angora tends to be very compliant with its required maintenance. They are people cats, and if a grooming routine is started early in its life, the Angora simply assumes being brushed is another \u201cthing\u201d he does with his human.", "facts": " Elegant, athletic Families with children, or singles with other pets Affectionate, intelligent, playful, social, and talkative", "tags": "adaptable, affectionate, athletic, Elegant, intelligent, playful, Social, talkative, Turkey, Turkish Angora, "}, "turkish van": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/cat/turkish-van/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/turkish-van.jpg", "name": "Turkish Van", "type": "cat", "text": "The Turkish Van originated in central and southwest Asia and likely came to Europe with returning Crusaders.

The cats appeared in England in 1955 simply as \u201cTurkish\u201d cats, and the \u201cVan\u201d distinction was added to prevent confusion with the Turkish Angora, which is a completely separate breed. The Turkish Van only arrived in the U.S. in 1982, and they are still relatively rare. They are a natural breed and are regarded in their homeland as a treasure. Curious and intelligent by nature, the Turkish Van is an adventurous and entertaining companion. Curious and intelligent by nature, the Turkish Van is an adventurous and entertaining companion. Unlike many cats, they love water, and will even swim on occasion.  They have a robust constitution, and are loving, loyal, and very affectionate if sometimes amusingly mischievous. With powerfully well-developed hind legs, a Van can be at your feet one minute and on top of the bookshelf the next. Adept at retrieving items and catching toys in mid-air, the Turkish Van is an acrobat, renowned for turning a somersault mid-chase just because he can. Once A Van starts running, he keeps running until he wears himself out. They get along well with other animals, but expect their authority to be respected. They don\u2019t need to be picked up and cuddled, but they want to be with you and participating in whatever you\u2019re doing, and they don\u2019t like to be alone for long periods. They do well in families, but will generally single out one person as their \u201cperson.\u201d Slow to mature, the Turkish Van does not reach its full size until age 3-5. They are large cats, and known for their exceptional agility. Well balanced and muscular, they have broad shoulders with a high center of gravity. The back legs are just marginally longer than the front legs, and the paws are quite large. These cats are so long, they can measure three feet from the tip of the nose to the end of their tails. Eyes colors are amber, blue, or odd eyed. The accepted Turkish Van coloration calls for a white cat with semi-long hair and colored markings that appear on the head and tail only. This is referred to a \u201cpiebald\u201d spotting. Most breed standards allow for body spots as long as the overall color does not cover more than 20% of the cat. The classic Van color is red tabby and white. Other colors that appear include cream, black, blue, and brown with tortoiseshell and patching patterning possible. The Turkish Van does not have an undercoat, and the texture of its fur is closely akin to the feel of cashmere. It is water resistant, so bathing really isn\u2019t necessary, although the cat will enjoy the water.

Within that litter was one brown kitten, thanks to their Siamese ancestry, and she was named Brownie. Janet Chiefari, the farm owner, took note of this unique kitten, who had both charm and looks. The following summer, Brownie had a litter of kittens, and one of her babies was a semi-longhaired black male who also featured a deep brown undercoat, which was quite unique. This kitten was named Minky. A year after that, Brownie mated with Minky, and they had a kitten named Teddy Bear, who was solid brown. They also had a brown-and-white female named Cocoa. Chiefari started breeding the cats and spreading the word about them, and the experimental breed was accepted in 1990. By 1995, it had CFF Championship status and Canadian Cat Association Championship status as well. York Chocolate cats are even-tempered, friendly, intelligent, curious, and energetic.

In addition to being affectionate, these cats are also known for enjoying plenty of hugs and cuddles, and they will gladly sit in a warm lap. They crave attention and will spend as much time with their owners as possible. In fact, these kitties will greet you when you come home and purr contentedly in order to communicate with you. The York Chocolate will get along great with other pets and with children of all ages. These cats enjoy plenty of play time that involves interaction with other pets and their human family, so you should make it a point to spend time with your cat, rather than letting him play with his toys alone. Moving toys and interactive play are best for this breed, which has a strong instinct to hunt. This is a large feline breed with solid bones and firm muscles, much like a traditional farm cat. However, what differentiates this breed from other farm cats is its semi-long, lustrous fur, which is light, soft, and resistant to matting. The undercoat is also extremely soft, and the fur is thicker at the chest, neck, and upper legs. Also, the tail is puffed and full, and the feet have some tufting between the toes. There is also a bit of feathering within the ears. The York Chocolate has beautiful eyes that are almond shaped. The eye color may be golden, hazel, or green. The York Chocolate comes in chocolate brown or lavender, as well as a combination of these two colors. Typically, the coat will be lighter in kittenhood, but it will develop into a silky, rich chocolate color as the kitten grows and reaches maturity. This breed requires minimal grooming, so a regular brushing that will help maintain the health of the skin and coat is enough.", "facts": " Large body, firm muscles Any cat loving household, including singles and families with children and other pets Friendly, affectionate, playful, energetic", "tags": "affectionate cat, cuddly cat, dark brown, Lavender, semi-long fur, York Chocolate, "}}
