Some Affenpinschers have white or gray hairs mixed in to its solid-colored coat, while others have a patch of white hair found on the neck.

Very well-suited for dog showing, these dogs are gentle and respond well to that type of attention. The Afghan Hound\u2019s coat is remarkable, although it requires plenty of grooming. When an Afghan Hound walks in the room, people certainly take notice. There is a lot to learn about the Afghan Hound, as it has a particularly rich and ancient history and have several aspects of its personality that make it a unique dog. Considered better-suited for older children who understand how to interact with dogs, it will not be a dog for everyone. People who need a versatile working dog, for example, can probably find a better breed in the Bouvier des Flandres than they can in the Afghan Hound. Let\u2019s learn more about this dog and what makes it part of dog breed royalty. The Afghan Hound is known as \u201cking of dogs\u201d for its appearance, general demeanor, and general nobility as a breed. Originally hailing from areas like the Sinai Peninsula (the Afghan Hound was even mentioned/portrayed in ancient Egyptian papyrus and were painted in Afghan caves as far back as 4,000 years ago), there\u2019s no denying the ancient origins of the Afghan Hound. Despite this long history, the breed has remained relatively pure, which means the modern deviations are not far off of the historical Afghan Hounds. As a sighthound (a dog that hunts by sight rather than necessarily using scents or the nose), the Afghan Hound has a rich history of working that its appearance might not convey. It has been both used as a shepherd and hunter, hunting down game such as deer and goats. With a thick coat, they were able to function in extreme seasons, which gives them a general outdoor versatility one would not necessarily expect. The Afghan Hound is generally considered an original without much of a pedigree to speak of\u2026 or, rather, it is one of those rare breeds that can be considered its own pedigree. Because the Afghan Hound is such an old breed of dog, its pedigree is essentially zilch \u2013 there\u2019s not a lot known about it. Historians can discern some hypothesis, knowing the areas where the Afghan Hound probably originated. But beyond that, the Afghan Hound is generally considered an original without much of a pedigree to speak of\u2026 or, rather, it is one of those rare breeds that can be considered its own pedigree. The food you give to your Afghan Hound will not be untypical for that of most dog breeds, but many people try different foods in order to \u201ctreat\u201d the Afghan Hound\u2019s coat \u2013 people who show their Afghan Hound, in particular. You don\u2019t have to take any special precautions in your dog\u2019s diet beyond assuring essential nutrition and a general food level that keeps the dog at a healthy weight. These dogs respond best to calm training. They can seem distant and aloof at times, which helps create that famous \u201caristocratic\u201d air, but if you are able to demonstrate effective leadership there\u2019s no reason the Afghan Hound can\u2019t be a perfectly obedient and eager-to-please dog. Just be sure not to treat it too harshly, as it can be a little sensitive to over training and prefers a patient leader. Running in the area around 60 pounds, there isn\u2019t a lot of variance in this dog\u2019s weight, including from gender to gender. You\u2019ll want to make sure your dog is regularly weighed, especially if you\u2019re raising an Afghan Hound for dog shows. A good adherence to this general size outline will be important if you want your dog to succeed in these shows. The aristocratic air of the Afghan Hound is obvious, but before you chalk it off as an aloof breed, it\u2019s important to realize this breed also can be very loyal and affectionate. One advantage of this more laid-back personality is that the Afghan Hound won\u2019t try to challenge you for dominance, making them better-suited for the less-assertive types who simply want a nice companion that won\u2019t try to run things. They are generally peaceful dogs, though they can be a little suspicious of strangers if not properly socialized and used to the presence of strangers as well as other dogs. The aristocratic air of the Afghan Hound is obvious, but before you chalk it off as an aloof breed, it\u2019s important to realize this breed also can be very loyal and affectionate. These dogs are considered generally healthy, which means your veterinarian probably won\u2019t need to be consulted too much, though the normal precautions should always be taken. Living about 14 years or so, which is what one can expect from a healthier breed of this size. A good routine for your Afghan Hound is to take them out \u2013 making sure you go through the door first \u2013 and give them a good, long walk and even a jog, as they\u2019ll be able to handle the speed with their relatively medium-to-large strides. Exercising should be considered a part of any dog\u2019s normal routine, but the Afghan Hound should respond well to exercise with a little more edge to it than smaller breeds. When it comes to play time, Afghan Hounds like to play games. They don\u2019t usually like playing fetch, but if you have the patience, they can be taught. The American Kennel Club sums up the breed: \u201cReferred to as an aristocrat, the Afghan Hound\u2019s appearance is one of dignity and aloofness. Well covered with thick, silky hair, very fine in texture, the Afghan hound\u2019s coat is a sort found among animals native to high altitudes.\u201d The AKC first recognized this breed in 1926. One of the most distinctive features of the Afghan Hound, the coat will require great care and regular grooming. Paying attention to grooming is especially important if you want to adhere to the standards of the American Kennel Club and the standards of dog shows, which will expect a dog to be properly clipped and its coat to have the proper length in the proper areas. Puppies should be raised, like many other breeds, to be properly socialized and to understand their boundaries \u2013 but generally the personality of Afghan Hounds will not be an overly aggressive or dominant one.

An authentic English terrier finds its home in a specific place \u2013 Airedale, of all places \u2013 but is just as happy to make its home with and your family. Like many terriers, you will find that this dog is capable of a lot of love, a lot of companionship, and can even make an excellent playmate. Its overall attractive coat is hard to resist for the younger members of your family and you\u2019ll find there\u2019s nothing quite like petting a terrier. There\u2019s a reason, after all, they call Airedale Terriers the so-called king of terriers. But is the Airedale Terrier for you? Depending on the type of \u201cdog person\u201d you are, your answer will vary. Each dog breed has its own strengths and weaknesses, and these strengths and weaknesses mean specific breeds can be more suitable to certain types of dog owners. As we learn about the Airedale Terrier, we\u2019ll also learn about the terrier group as a whole and hopefully you\u2019ll just find a little something out about the types of dogs you\u2019d prefer to bring home. Let\u2019s find out more about the Airedale Terrier.  Like many terriers, you will find that this dog is capable of a lot of love, a lot of companionship, and can even make an excellent playmate. Like many terriers, the Airedale Terrier hails from the British Isles \u2013 England, specifically. Many people hypothesize that the Airedale Terrier comes from the Aire valley in England, which obviously lends itself to the dog\u2019s name \u2013 although names can be deceiving, particularly if the wrong one catches on. Since the Airedale Terrier\u2019s history, like many other breeds, is focused on the 19th and 20th centuries, when it started gaining recognition, we can safely say that this breed did probably arise out of that region in England. How were they bred? They were bred as jacks-of-all-trade, able to provide both companionship, a keen hunter\u2019s instinct, and have developed a sporty, active demeanor. The first Airedale Terriers \u2013 or at least their ancestors \u2013 were not very similar to the Airedales that we see today. This makes this specific breed a relatively recent development in the world of terriers. The Airedale Terrier\u2019s pedigree obviously comes from a number of working terriers native to places like northern England. Specifically, we know that Otterhounds and terriers now known as Welsh Terriers were bred in order to develop the Airedale. This means that if you went too far back in your time machine, you wouldn\u2019t be able to spot anything really resembling the Airedale Terrier that we know today, save from a few distant cousins. Terriers have their root in hunting activities, and while they might not be the main attraction like a retriever or a pointer might be, the terrier did serve a purpose and was happy to fulfill its duty alongside the team. You can find this friendly, eager-to-please demeanor in a number of terriers today, and we dare say that the Airedale Terrier is one of the breeds that will be eager to join your team. They were bred as jacks-of-all-trade, able to provide both companionship and a keen hunter\u2019s instinct The Airedale Terrier can be deceptively light, which means their frame can put on the pounds if you\u2019re not careful about their diet and exercise. Regular discipline with exercise and a steady diet of lean meats and good whole ingredients like vegetables will provide all the nutrition your Airedale Terrier needs. Airedale Terriers are known as quick learners, which mean they\u2019re actually relatively smart. This is a good thing, of course, but it comes with easy boredom. If you\u2019re the kind of person who wants a dog to lounge around the house with them, this probably isn\u2019t the dog for you. Airedale Terriers like to be challenged and can handle a surprising amount of training. Making sure that these dogs learn obedience from a young age is a priority. Weighing in the 40-50 pound range, these athletic dogs can actually look a little heavier than they really are thanks to a coat that naturally hangs off their torso. Be sure you understand your Airedale Terrier\u2019s weight and that you\u2019re able to handle exercising with them on a regular basis. Intelligent dogs prone to boredom, you\u2019ll find that Airedale Terriers are great matches for you if you are similarly prone to boredom. If you like a lot of challenges and hate the idea of a routine, the temperament of an Airedale Terrier might be exactly the type of temperament for you. If, on the other hand, you\u2019d prefer a lap dog that knows how to relax on the couch, this probably isn\u2019t your breed. Like many medium-to-larger dogs, Airedale Terriers can experience hip dysplasia. The leading killer of Airedale Terriers is cancer. A range of around 10-13 years can be expected, with an average of around 11 years or so. This is normal not only for dogs of its size, but dogs in general. With a healthy, active life and a stimulating environment, your Airedale Terrier should be able to live a good, long time. Airedale Terriers are known as quick learners, which mean they\u2019re quite smart. Regular walking and play is recommended \u2013 and, in fact, regular discipline with exercise should be considered mandatory for dogs of this size.

Not a bad reputation to have. Expect a hard and stiff coat \u2013 this certainly isn\u2019t a toy dog that was designed for petting. The coat does look attractive, however, and typifies the coats of many terriers. Raising an Airedale Terrier from a young age will require effective obedience training. This isn\u2019t really a \u201ctraining wheels\u201d type of dog that\u2019s easy to train.

Johnson of Summerville, Georgia, he saved the breed from extinction by selecting the best of the breed he could find and started a selection program.

In fact, the state of Virginia made the American Foxhound its official state dog in 1966. Not only that, the American Foxhound is also one of the rarest breeds. Although in the past, the Foxhound hasn\u2019t been considered a house pet, this dog may fit into your household, as it is well mannered and amiable. The American Foxhound is a natural hunter \u2013 this dog will go after a scent and won\u2019t listen to commands. An active breed, the Foxhound loves the outdoors and is up for any type of exercise. This breed isn\u2019t suited for city life, as it needs plenty of space to run around. Typical of hound breeds, the American Foxhound doesn\u2019t like to be left alone for long periods of time. If you\u2019re active, live alone, enjoy the outdoors, have a family and are an experienced dog handler, the American Foxhound will be the dog for you. The American Foxhound, also known as the Foxhound, is all-American \u2013 it\u2019s one of the only breeds that truly originated in the United States. Developed from a line of hounds in 1650, American Foxhounds were the result of careful breeding by Robert Brooke. Bringing them from England to the US, Brooke eventually created a breeding and working pack of black-and-tan foxhounds. These Foxhounds are said to be the foundation for the Black and Tan Coonhound, another American original. In early 18th century, Foxhounds made its way to Virginia. In fact, George Washington received a pack of foxhounds as a gift in the mid-1700s. Washington was a huge fan of the breed \u2013 he kept, bred and hunted American Foxhounds. As well, he maintained detailed records and pedigrees that established some of the best early examples of the American Foxhound. In 1785, after acquiring several large French Hounds, Washington used these imports to increase the size of his American Foxhounds. For increased speed, the American Foxhound was bred with hounds from Ireland in the 1830s. The American Foxhound was developed specifically to hunt American grey and red foxes in open fields, woodlands and river valleys. But there were a few problems \u2013 the grey fox moved slowly, and the red fox was uncommon in the eastern United States, a popular place for foxhunting. To combat these issues, English red foxes were imported for a sporting chase.  Over time, the English foxes inbred with the US foxes, creating a faster native fox. Developed by the wealthy for sport hunting, the American Foxhound is descended from English hounds brought to America in 1650. A century later, these dogs were mixed with French hounds. Select a dry dog food with high-quality meat ingredients, protein levels and higher fat content. Try to stay away from dog foods that list soy or corn products as one of the first five ingredients. These are safe ingredients for a dog, but the American Foxhound is an active breed and it will need higher quality nutrition to keep up its energy level. An active breed, the Foxhound loves the outdoors and is up for any type of exercise. Because it is a type of hound, you\u2019ll find that the Foxhound is moderately easy to train. But because every dog is different, your American Foxhound may be easier or more difficult to train. Like any dog, the American Foxhound\u2019s attention span is short, so keep training sessions short. Make sure that sessions are not overly repetitive and be calm and patient when teaching any skill. If you speak harshly to your Foxhound, it will avoid training and may lead to stubbornness. After tackling the basics with your dog and establishing leadership and trust, enroll your Foxhound in advanced obedience, agility and tracking classes. American Foxhounds  generally weigh anywhere from 40 to 60 pounds. If your family is active and loves the outdoors, the American Foxhound is the dog for you. They need lots of room to run \u2013 more than an average backyard \u2013 so it thrives in a rural environment. If you let them, Foxhounds will move all day long, which makes it important to have the room outdoors. This breed gets along great with kids and other dogs (if possible, should be raised alongside other dogs), but not so much with cats. After a long day of hunting, the American Foxhound will have enough energy to play with the kids. Part of its hound dog nature, American Foxhounds love to bay and howl, especially at night and when left alone. This isn\u2019t a behavior that can be trained out of them. Separation anxiety is an issue with the American Foxhound, especially if it isn\u2019t properly exercised. When left alone and bored, there\u2019s no telling what it will do. That\u2019s why you should make sure there are plenty of things to do for your dog. And other companion dogs to keep your Foxhound company will also help. The American Foxhound is generally a healthy breed, however, some health concerns may include congenital deafness, ear infections, hip dysplasia, Pelger-Huet anomoly and thrombocytopathy (disorders of the blood platelet and abnormal functioning of the platelets).

A hard-working hunting dog, this breed can be used as a tracker in the field. Just like the Energizer Bunny, the Foxhound will keep going and going for hours without become tired. Once they catch a scent, they will follow it without distraction. When not being used for hunting, the American Foxhound should be kept in a fenced-in area or on a leash.

The American Kennel Association says this about the breed: \u201cOne of America\u2019s native breeds, the American Foxhound is also one of our rarest. This tall hound sports a close, hard coat that can be any color. The Foxhound in this country is used for four purposes, thus calling for hounds of a different characteristics: competitive field trial hounds and \u201ctrail\u201d hounds (speed is most important), fox hunting hounds (slow workers with good voices), and pack hounds (15 to 20 hounds or more, used by hunt clubs and farmers).\u201d The AKC first recognized this breed in 1886. Sporting a hard-textured, medium length coat that lies close to the body, the American Foxhound is protected from briars, burrs and brush encountered while hunting. Coat color doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to breed standard and it comes in many colors. All colors and markings are acceptable. Grooming the American Foxhound is easy. This breed sheds lightly year round, so a regular weekly brushing is recommended to keep loose hair under control. You won\u2019t have to bathe your dog very often, only when the Foxhound is dirty or begins to smell. Training and socializing your American Foxhound should start early. These are smart dogs that will pick up the basics quickly.

Identical in appearance to the Rat Terrier, barring its obvious lack of hair, the American Hairless Terrier, or AHT, is a fairly small dog with strong shoulders, a well-muscled neck and powerful legs. And although it looks more like a toy breed, it is actually a highly intelligent working breed. American Hairless Terriers possess traits that are characteristic of all terriers: They are energetic, intelligent, extremely loving and make excellent companions for a wide array of dog owners. They also make excellent pets for animal lovers that suffer from various allergies. Although a fairly new breed, the American Hairless Terrier has gathered quite the fan club in its few decades of existence. The story of the American Hairless Terrier began in 1972 when a single hairless puppy was born in a Rat Terrier litter owned by Edwin and Willie Scott. This puppy, which was named Josephine, went on to become the mother of the entire breed. Once Josephine reached maturity she was bred to a Rat Terrier and produced one female hairless pup. However, Josephine failed to produce any pups with the hairless trait in her next few litters. In her 9th litter, she rewarded the Scott\u2019s perseverance by producing two hairless pups, one of each sex. These two puppies became the foundation on which the American Hairless Terrier was developed as a breed. The American Hairless Terrier is a direct descendant of the Rat Terrier, which is in turn a development from a breed of European terrier called Feists, which were crossed with Beagles, Greyhounds and Miniature Pinschers. These dogs are highly energetic and should be fed on high-quality dry food. Like Rat Terriers, AHTs are highly intelligent and are also eager to please. Like Rat Terriers, AHTs are highly intelligent and are also eager to please. They are highly trainable and respond well to positive reinforcement based training methods. They can, however, turn willful and stubborn if an owner fails to demonstrate calm and assertive leadership. American Hairless Terriers can weigh anywhere between 5 to 25 pounds. Like most terriers, American Hairless Terriers are highly intelligent, alert and playful. They also are a very loving breed of dog and get along excellently with children. They also possess the determination and fearlessness of terriers and make excellent guard dogs. Like all terriers, they love playing, digging and chasing small game and enjoy competing in agility trials. It is important that owners keep these tendencies in mind when purchasing a pet because catering to a terrier\u2019s needs can sometimes be an overwhelming task for a mild or laidback pet owner. Because the gene associated with the American Hairless Terrier\u2019s lack of hair is recessive, they do not suffer from absent premolars or other breeding complications that plague other hairless dog breeds. They can however suffer from occasional cuts and bruises resulting from vigorous play. American Hairless Terriers have fairly long life spans and can live for 14 to 16 years. American Hairless Terriers are extremely strong and athletic and require a significant amount of exercise. Owners should not purchase these dogs if they cannot take them on a long walk every day. When deprived of an outlet for their excess energy, these dogs can turn destructive and develop other behavioral problems. Like most terriers, American Hairless Terriers are highly intelligent, alert and playful. The AKC has included the American Hairless Terrier in its Foundation Stock Series and allows the breed to compete in performance events and open shows. The AKC also has this to say about the American Hairless Terrier: \u201cThe breeding of the American Hairless Terriers (AHT) began in earnest in the early 1970\u2019s when a hairless puppy was born into a litter of mid-size Rat Terriers. This was not the first hairless puppy born to these parents, but it was the first to be given to a couple in Louisiana, Edwin and Willie Scott, who immediately fell in love with this female puppy and named her Josephine. Josephine became the foundation for the American Hairless Terrier breed. The AHT is well known for its propensity for fewer allergic reactions than other breeds, allowing them into homes once denied. This combined with their intelligence and ease of care make them perfect companions while maintaining the drive to excel in performance events.\u201d Since they lack a coat, owners should take care to protect their American Hairless Terrier\u2019s skin by using a sunscreen. They may also need a light sweater to keep warm during colder months. It is important that American Hairless Terrier puppies be socialized with humans and other animals at an early age.

Although the breed\u2019s history has never been officially documented, it has been used as a tree dog and an all-purpose hunting dog in America since the time of the Spanish conquistadors. As a breed that was developed more for its temperament and capabilities, rather than physical appearance, the American Leopard Hound\u2019s \u201clook\u201d can vary to a great degree. However, its one defining characteristic is its merle or splotched coat. That said, Leopard Hounds do come in solid coat varieties as well as a variety of colors including yellow, black, red, blue, brindle and mouse-grey. The Leopard Hound can also vary in size depending on its breeding line. For the most part though these dogs are medium sized and powerfully built. Their long legs and extremely strong hindquarters enable these dogs to traverse a variety of tough terrain and climb trees with relative ease. As far as the American Leopard Hound\u2019s temperament goes, it is an extremely intelligent dog that is also brave on the hunt. These dogs have been used for decades to hunt feral pigs and other escaped livestock. They are also capable of hunting much larger and more dangerous prey like wild boar and bear. When hunting game, these dogs are said to be able to corner even the most dangerous types of prey and hold them at bay using only their body language and eye contact. They are also extremely agile and vigilant and are able to escape any sudden rush attacks by their prey. The American Leopard Hound is an ancient breed of dog originating from Northern America. Although the exact history and origin of the American Leopard Hound is unknown, there is no doubt about their significance in American history. The early settlers of America were a farming people and would often keep hundreds of cows, pigs and chickens on their settlements. It was quite common for the settlers to build a wooden fence around their homes and to let their animals roam freely around the perimeter of this fence. It is believed that the Leopard Hound was charged with rounding up this livestock and herding back any that escaped. Because not a lot is known about the exact history of the American Leopard Hound, tracing its pedigree is a somewhat impossible task. However, many Leopard Hound enthusiasts and experts believe that these dogs first came into existence around the time of the Spanish conquistadors. Another school of thought, however, believes that these dogs were bought to the Americas by the French, English and Irish settlers that traveled to the new world.

When its owners fail to do so, these dogs can sometimes try to assume the role of the pack leader, which in turn can result in various behavioral problems. American Leopard Hounds are a generally healthy breed of dog and do not suffer from a great number of hereditary ailments. An important point to note however is that two leopard patterned dogs are never bred together as this can result in certain genetic problems associated with the dog\u2019s hearing and sight. American Leopard Hounds enjoy a fairly long lifespan of 12 to15 years. American Leopard Hounds are a working breed of dog and require at least an hour of rigorous exercise each day.

American Mastiffs may not be the easiest dogs to keep, but they are a calm and steady breed you\u2019re sure to love. The American Mastiff was developed by Fredericka Wagner of Piketon, Ohio. This breed is the result of a crossing between the English Mastiff and the Anatolian Mastiff. Early litters of puppies had firmer, tighter lips than either parent breed and they drooled much less. Outcrossing for the American Mastiff breed continued until the late 1900s until Wagner had enough stock to breed from her existing lines.

Unfortunately, the American Mastiff can carry some of those same health problems, though the risk is a little lower.

Despite its tough look, the American Staffordshire Terrier is affectionate and loving. The American Stafford Terrier originated in 19th century Staffordshire, England.  Developed with a strong muscular build, this breed was initially used for fighting (sad, but tragically true). They were also bred with the purpose of \u201cbull baiting\u201d in their original form. After this barbaric practice was finally banned, these puppers finally got the chance to show their true, affectionate side. Eventually, bull and terrier type dogs finally found their way to America as early as 1870, where they eventually became the unique breed known today as American Staffordshire Terrier. Also,  they are known as the Pit Dog, Pit Bull Terrier, American Bull Terrier, Staffy, and Yankee Terrier. When the Cruelty to Animals Act was introduced in the mid 1800\u2019s, these puppers were freed from their harsh life of fighting and baiting. In time, they were described as confident, muscular, good natured and loyal companions, which made them popular not only as dashing and elegant show dogs \u2013 but also as affectionate family pets.  The American Staffordshire Terrier became popular in the 1920s thanks to one of these delightful doggos being cast as Pete the Pup in the popular serial Our Gang (aka The Little Rascals). Pete the Pup sparked the interest of viewers all across the United States, and soon after, families all over got to experience the delight of having one of these puppers as a loyal family friend.  Sadly, American Staffordshire Terriers today are often connected with the image and subculture of gangsters. Due to their popularity amongst such social circles, the American Staffies continue to be mistreated, and their true, good natured character is discouraged by such reckless owners. Pedigree  Many people believe that the American Staffordshire Terrier is a result of breeding the White English Terrier, Fox Terrier, or the Black and Tan Terrier with the Bulldog.

The most prominent of these features is their slender, muscular look that speaks of an athletic and powerful nature. It makes the Staffy an energetic pet and an ideal protector of the household. The American Staffordshire Terrier was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1936. It has been a popular show dog ever since, and often seen as a loving family pet.

To make sure your precious pet stays happy and healthy, you will have to pay attention to their nutrition and make sure that it is up to contemporary standards. Like all dogs, the AmStaff will also require a well-balanced and high-grade diet to stay in top shape. Some pet owners decide to follow the commercial pet food route since it is the best option for most dogs, but others prefer to feed their pups a raw diet or even prepare the meals for their dog on their own.

In terms of nutrients, crude protein should be no less than 30 percent, while crude fat should be no less than 20 percent and fiber content needs to be 4 percent or less. Avoid cheap foods with carb fillers that are full of additives and artificial ingredients. Once you find the perfect formula, make sure it is also appropriate for your dog\u2019s size and activity level (medium or large athletic breeds), as well as their age (puppy, adult, senior). Even if you are going with kibble, it\u2019s a good idea to consult with your vet in regards to brand and portion size. While dog food manufacturers are kind enough to provide useful feeding guidelines, all dogs are different and won\u2019t necessarily fit into that box. Only your vet will be able to determine that personal needs of your specific pup, so make sure to keep them in the conversation before committing to your doggie\u2019s diet.

With great care, balanced diet, and regular vet checkups, your Staffy can easily reach the 15-year mark, and perhaps even go beyond it. And in that time, a Staffy\u2019s true temperament can easily establish itself \u2013 a character of compassion, companionship, and good nature overall. Your American Staffordshire Terrier will need regular exercise. These impressive dogs are strong and energetic, so they won\u2019t be content with being a couch potato. OK, some of them might be pleased with getting to nap on the sofa, but it\u2019s not what you should be encouraging them to do. And American Staffy is a lean, tall, and muscular dog breed \u2013 with a defined and strong frame. In many ways \u2013 they depend on regular exercise. Take your dog on daily walks, make sure they play, and get to be active in general. Frisbees, fetch, track running or jogging by your side are all great forms of exercise, and ideal for spending all that pent up energy. If your American Staffordshire Terrier doesn\u2019t have enough exercise and activities that help him burn off excess energy, he can get fidgety or bored. More often than not, Amstaff boredom leads to destructive behaviors and nervousness, so your furniture or shoes might fall prey to the boredom of your dog. To prevent this, offer puzzle toys, engaging playtime and enough tiring exercise. As a rule of thumb, these dogs will need at least 60 to 90 minutes of daily exercise. Keep them stimulated and tuckered out and these pooches will be absolute sweethearts. Allow them to laze around and grow bored at your own risk!  A protector and pack dog by nature, the American Staffordshire Terrier will fight to protect its family. The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cThe American Staffordshire Terrier, known to their fans as AmStaffs, are smart, confident, and good natured companions. Their courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well socialized AmStaff is a loyal and trustworthy friend to the end.\u201d The breed was accepted by the American Kennel Club quite early on \u2013 in 1936. What is more, AKC opened up a special \u201cstud book\u201d, i.e. the breed\u2019s registry, a few times until the 1970\u2019s. This registry ensured that the breed remains pure and ideal in its features. That way the AmStaff can continue to be its jolly old self!  The American Staffordshire Terrier\u2019s coat is short and glossy. Easy to care for, you\u2019ll only need to brush it every once in a while with a firm bristle brush. Its coat can come in a variety of different colors. Since the Amstaff\u2019s coat is thin, it is not well suited for colder climates. This is a dog for warm climates only (although obviously those adorable dog jackets and boots can help quite a bit). What is more, a short coat such as this one makes for easy hygiene. If your staffy gets all muddy in the summertime, a quick hose down will quickly get them clean again. Just make sure they are promptly dried. Like any kind of puppy, the American Staffordshire Terrier will be hard to resist. It\u2019s just so cute! But don\u2019t let that cuteness distract you \u2013 your new addition needs to start training as early as possible in order for it to grow into a healthy and well-adjusted dog. American Staffordshire Terriers are misunderstood because they are often victims of poor socialization and wrong training practices, but with the right approach, these lovely dogs grow up to be wonderful companions. So, to make sure your puppy fulfills his potential, start training at few weeks of age for best results. Those precious early days with your puppy must not be wasted!

No one is exactly sure of the origin of the American Water Spaniel, but the breed did make its first appearance in the 1860s. These dogs followed settlers that moved to the developing areas of the Midwestern United States. A hunting and retrieving dog, the American Water Spaniel was bred to flush and retrieve game in all conditions and terrain, including water. Although it was seen primarily as a duck and waterfowl retriever, it evolved into a combo of hunting spaniels and the hunting retrievers. Working equally well in water and on land, the AWS is a great swimmer and can sniff out its prey. Thanks to its small size, the American Water Spaniel fits nicely in canoes or other small boats needed to hunt waterfowl on inland lakes. By the end of the 19th century, the American Water Spaniel had made a name for itself, gaining popularity with sportsmen in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota. You can call the American Water Spaniel\u2019s pedigree a mystery. Developed sometime in the late 1860s, many believe that the AWS is descended from crosses of the Irish Water Spaniel, the Old English Water Spaniel, the Curly Coated Retriever, the Field Spaniel and the Poodle. You should feed your American Water Spaniel a dog food that contains a mix of poultry, lamb, fish meal, wheat, and corn. Avoid feeding this breed anything that contains white rice, soy, beet pulp, or horse meat. You\u2019ll find the American Water Spaniel easy to train, because it is intelligent and eager to please. You\u2019ll find the American Water Spaniel easy to train, because it is intelligent and eager to please.

Once your American Water Spaniel masters the basics, enroll your dog in advanced training. With its high intelligence, this breed needs to be challenged and mentally stimulated. The American Water Spaniel is wary of strangers, and if it is not properly socialized, it will distrust people it doesn\u2019t know.

It can play all day long, and at the end of the day, curl up on your lap for extra cuddles. It will partake in all kinds of activities, on land or in water. This breed loves to be around people and will want to follow you around no matter where you go. The AWS is not a dog for people who spend a lot of time away from their home. This breed develops separation anxiety if let alone for alone periods of time, and will bark or howl. This dog needs plenty of companionship, exercise and play time to combat boredom. A vocal breed, it\u2019s an understatement to say that the American Water Spaniel likes to bark. When they are happy, need attention or left alone, the breed will bark\u2026 just to hear the sound of its own voice. Start training to avoid this behavior when your dog is a puppy.  Some of the common health concerns for the American Water Spaniel include hip dysplasia, mitral valve insufficiency and pulmonic stenosis. A few of the less common concerns include patellar luxation and Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA). The American Water Spaniel has an average lifespan of 13 to 15 years. Because this is a hunting breed, the American Water Spaniel needs plenty of exercise. Running, hunting, swimming, hiking and bike rides \u2013 these are just a few of the ways you can tire your dog out. The AWS needs room to run, so you\u2019ll need to have a fenced in yard. If you have a swimming pool, even better! And even though this is a smaller breed, the American Water Spaniel doesn\u2019t do well in apartments. Because of the lack of space to run around, this dog may become destructive. Great with children, the American Water Spaniels are patient and will put up with boisterous kids. However, the AWS will snap if startled, so children need to be taught to never sneak up on a sleeping dog or approach from the rear.

The American Kennel Association says this about the breed: \u201cAlthough a very rare breed, the American Water Spaniel has its own state-wide fan club as the State Dog of Wisconsin! A truly dual-purpose dog, bred for companionship and top-notch retrieval ability, the AWS is active, muscular and medium in size.\u201d The AKC first recognized this breed in 1940. A tough coat is needed when hunting \u2013 that\u2019s why the American Water Spaniel is outfitted with a double coat with a dense undercoat. This protects the dog from water, extreme temperatures and underbrush. Its topcoat can be wavy or curly, or both.  Short fur covers their faces and the fur on the legs is slightly feathered. As for color, the American Water Spaniel\u2019s coat can be solid liver, brown, or dark chocolate. A small amount of white on the toes or chest may also be apparent. Expect some light shedding throughout the year, as well as a heavy shed during season changes. It helps to implement a regular brushing routine to keep loose and dead hair from accumulating in your house. You should only wash your dog when needed, as it can strip the natural oils from the coat, leaving the dog with dry, irritated skin. Because American Water Spaniels can be wary of strangers, it is best to get them used to new people and situations as early as possible.

Fortunately, you\u2019ve come to the right place to find out. Keep your eyes glued to this page and read on to learn everything that there is to know about this fascinating breed. Easygoing and calm, the Anatolian loves kids and will happily spend hours playing with them. Back in the day, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog was a combat dog, used to take down large game (Which included lions and horses. We\u2019re talking serious game here.). In its homeland of Turkey, this breed was modified to livestock from predators. Thanks to its size, coat, and color, the Anatolian could blend in with the flock it protected, so that predators wouldn\u2019t even know the dog was there. With its strong and independent nature, these dogs could manage and protect livestock without constant attention from owners. Able to live in both hot and cold climates, the Anatolian does well in practically any environment. The Anatolian Shepherd Dog eventually made its way to North American with Lt. Robert Ballard of the US Navy, who had raised a pair of working shepherd puppies while he was stationed in Turkey in 1967. After bringing them back to America, the pair produced their first litter in 1970, which provided the backbone of the breed in the U.S. The popularity of the breed grew almost exponentially from there. An ancient breed, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog originated in Turkey about 6,000 years ago. Dog experts recognize three types of original Turkish flock-guarding breeds: the Akbash in west Turkey, the Kangal in central Turkey, and Kars eastern Turkey. The American version of the Anatolian Shepherd is a result of mixing these flock-guarding dogs together. It is practically a superdog that combines the best qualities of all three breeds. Even though this is a big dog, the Anatolian Shepherd is a conservative eater. This breed doesn\u2019t do well with commercial foods that are high in protein. In its native environment, the Anatolian Shepherd sticks to a mainly a vegetarian diet. But your dog will thrive quite well on a quality lamb/rice or chicken based diet. You may choose to go with a commercially produced holistic diet, or supplement a dry food diet with cooked chicken, cooked rice, yogurt and/or cottage cheese. As well, a Vitamin C supplement will offer additional health benefits to your Anatolian Shepherd Dog. This is not a particularly easy dog to feed given these very specific dietary requirements. As always, if you are in any way concerned about either establishing or altering the diet of your Antolian Shepherd, it\u2019s worth consulting with a veterinarian first. While pet blogs and dog food manufacturers may provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still merely guidelines and might not apply to every animal. After all, all dogs are different and each has their own needs. The only person qualified to accurately determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is a vet. So always rely on their expertise before deciding what to put in your pup\u2019s belly. The Anatolian Shepherd Dog needs a large home with lots of space, and loves to be outside. Not for the first-time owner, Anatolian Shepherds need a confident leader who can easily establish themself as the alpha in the relationship. This breed is stubborn and dominant, but once this dog knows who is in charge (that should be you), training should go smoothly. Trainers need a strong and consistent hand to establish leadership. If not, don\u2019t be surprised if your Anatolian takes over your household. That said, it\u2019s still important to focus on positive reinforcement and rewards throughout training for the best results. Overly negative training is closer to abuse and won\u2019t yield the proper results. This dog requires a firm, yet gentle hand during training. It\u2019s a tricky balance and not all dog owners will be up to the task. When it comes to a dog\u2019s instincts, you can\u2019t train it out of them. This holds true for the Anatolian Shepherd Dog\u2019s innate sense to protect its family, which includes people and other animals in the household. You can train your dog to limit these behaviors, but don\u2019t expect these habits to desist. Instead, you can use these protective instincts to protect your household and everyone in the family. Anatolians will be wary of strangers, so ensure that visitors to your home are introduced to the dog properly. This is one big dog! The Anatolian Shepherd Dog varies in weight, tipping the scales anywhere from 80 to 150 pounds. Females average in with a weight of 100 pounds, while males average a weight of 130. A working breed at heart, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog takes its duties as a guard dog seriously. You are now its flock and your Anatolian will alert you to danger with a loud and deep bark that resonates. Even though this breed is independent and stubborn, you\u2019ll also notice how devoted it is to its family. Of course, this dog would do well for farmers as well, but if you think you can take on this huge dog, it will make a wonderful addition to your family. It just requires the right household that is capable of meeting the specific needs of an Anatolian Shepherd. This guard dog is naturally suspicious of strangers \u2013 be sure that this trait doesn\u2019t turn into an aggressive one. Start socialization early and introduce your Anatolian to new people and experiences as a puppy. An experienced handler with strong leadership skills will be able to keep aggression from developing. When bringing a new person into the home, instruct the visitor not to pet your Anatolian at first. Your dog will determine on its own if this is a safe person and needs the time to make that decision. The Anatolian Shepherd loves kids, but may see other children as a threat, so this breed should not be left alone when children bring their friends over to play. This breed\u2019s sense of protection also relates to animals that aren\u2019t a part of its family. If a dog it doesn\u2019t know makes its way onto your property, the Anatolian may attack. A guard dog is always on duty, so the Anatolian Shepherd Dog will bark at sounds in the night. Even if these noises are in the distance, this dog will alert you to the threat with a loud bark. This is a highly protective pup and needs a quiet environment without many strangers to thrive. In other words, don\u2019t even think about raising one of these dogs in an apartment building. You\u2019ll need to mentally simulate your Anatolian Shepherd, otherwise, it may become destructive when bored. And with that powerful jaw, nothing is safe from a chewing \u2013 that includes furniture and drywall. You\u2019ll need to give your Anatolian plenty of things to do while you\u2019re out, or you may come home to a huge mess. This dog requires an owner who can keep up with some pretty substantial physical and mental demands. So, if you can\u2019t dedicate a significant amount of time keeping your pooch mentally stimulated and physically active every day, don\u2019t even consider bringing an Anatolian Shepherd into your home. Generally, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a healthy breed. However, some health concerns include cancer, ear infections, entropion, hip dysplasia and hypothyroidism. It\u2019s important to maintain regularly scheduled appointments with a vet (especially as your pooch ages into its senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as soon as possible. The Anatolian Shepherd Dog has an average lifespan of 10 to 13 years. Look at the size of the dog. Obviously, you can\u2019t fit one of this powerful pups into a small apartment! Even though it doesn\u2019t need as much exercise as other large breeds, owners will need to take their Anatolian Shepard for lots of walks and give it plenty of room to run around. This breed wants nothing to do with games of catch or fetch. It needs a challenge such as pulling a sled or cart, or tracking activities. Because of its instinct to guard flocks, Anatolian Shepherd Dog works best on farms. If you have small children, this may not be the best breed for you, as the Anatolian may not get along with children it doesn\u2019t know. A working breed at heart, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog takes its duties as a guard dog seriously. The American Kennel Association says this about the breed: \u201cLarge, rugged and powerful, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a working guard dog, possessing a superior ability to protect livestock. While not a \u201cglamour\u201d breed, the Anatolian\u2019s loyalty, independence and hardiness is cherished by breeders and owners.\u201d The AKC first recognized this breed in 1996. Outfitted with touchably soft fur, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog has a one-inch long coat, along with a thick undercoat. You may see some dogs feathering on the ears, legs, and tail. Expect to see the coat come in a range of colors, including pinto, white, and brindle, and fawn with a black mask. When it comes to grooming, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that Anatolian Shepherd Dog is low maintenance. Expect this dog\u2019s short coat to shed throughout the year. You can keep on top of it by employing regular brushing habits. And since this breed doesn\u2019t have a dog odor, you\u2019ll only have to give your Anatolian Shepherd Dog a bath a few times a year.

The breed gets its name from the Swiss herders known as the Senn and Appenzell region of the Swiss Alps to which this breed is native. Like its cousins the Entlebucher, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog and the Bernese Mountain Dog, the Appenzeller is a well-muscled and powerfully built dog. Although a medium-sized dog, it is extremely strong and is capable of pulling small carts and trolleys and working as an all-purpose farm dog. Appenzeller\u2019s have a thick double-coat that is black, brown and white in color and its ears are high set and floppy. Appenzellers are an extremely hard working breed and require a great deal of physical and mental exercise to remain happy and healthy. Although an excellent herder and guarder of livestock, their high maintenance and high exercise requirements have not made them overly popular in the United States. Also known as the Appenzeller Mountain Dog and Appenzell Cattle Dog, the Appenzeller Sennenhunde is the rarest of the four ancient Swiss mountain dog breeds. The Appenzeller Sennenhunde is an ancient breed and has been used in Switzerland for droving, guarding and general farm work for thousands of years. The breed was recognized as a native Swiss breed requiring conservation in 1897 and the first breed club was formed in 1906 by Dr. Albert Heim. These dogs were first introduced to the U.S in the early 1950s. It is believed that the Appenzellers, like the other three Swiss mountain dogs, is believed to have descended from the Roman Molossers which were crossed with the native Swiss dogs. The Appenzeller Sennenhunde is not a picky eater and will quickly devour any food that is set in front of him. Care should be taken however to ensure that these dogs do not over-eat. Appenzellers are an extremely intelligent breed and can learn new tasks quickly. Appenzellers are an extremely intelligent breed and can learn new tasks quickly. However, they are also capable of independent thinking and require owners that can demonstrate loving but firm leadership, consistently. If an owner is meek or unsure, these dogs can quickly assume the role of the pack leader and start trying to dictate terms. This can be dangerous considering the dog\u2019s size and strength. For this reason, Appenzellers are not recommended as a dog breed for first-time owners. A full grown Appenzeller Sennenhunde male can weigh anywhere between 50 to 70 pounds. Like most other herding breeds, Appenzellers are extremely self-assured and intelligent. When provided with loving but firm leadership, they will bond form an unshakeable bond with their owners and will willingly put their lives at risk to protect them. As a herder and livestock guardian, the Appenzeller Sennenhunde was bred to be brave and to be wary of strangers. These characteristics make them excellent guard dogs. However, they can often bark excessively and should be corrected promptly to ensure that they do not become a nuisance in closely populated neighborhoods. Appenzellers are extremely affectionate towards children and love to romp and play with them. Care should be taken however considering the dog\u2019s size and strength as they can sometimes unwittingly knock over or injure extremely young children. Socialization is an extremely important part of this dog\u2019s training. Appenzellers should be socialized early on in life with as many people and animals as possible. This will prevent any overly suspicious or aggressive behavior they may display towards strangers later on in life. Appenzellers can sometimes become stubborn and willful when not provided with strong and consistent leadership. Therefore it is important that Appenzeller Sennenhunde owners set rules, boundaries and limitations early on in the dog\u2019s life. Owners should also have a rudimentary understanding of dog psychology and ensure that the dog sees them as the pack leader. This is extremely important for such strong and powerful breed. The Appenzeller is an extremely healthy breed of dog with little to no hereditary health issues. This is quite rare for a breed of this size. An Appenzeller that is well cared for will often enjoy a lifespan of up to 14 years. Appenzellers were bred to work hard throughout the day, and ensuring that they have enough physical and mental exercise is an important aspect of being a responsible Appenzeller owner. Like all working dogs, Appenzellers too require a \u2018meaningful\u2019 task that they can apply themselves to each day. When denied of such a job, they can often turn moody and neurotic and can develop various undesirable behaviors. Like most other herding breeds, the Appenzeller Sennenhunde is extremely self-assured and intelligent. The Appenzeller Sennenhunde is included in the American Kennel Club\u2019s Foundation Stock Service. The Appenzeller\u2019s double coat is relatively easy to care for and is fairly low maintenance in terms of grooming. The dog\u2019s coat should be brushed with a rubber brush to remove any dead hairs once in every two weeks. Appenzellers are highly intelligent and are extremely fast learners. Therefore they should be given a clear and consistent picture of what acceptable and unacceptable behaviors are from an early age. Training too should start early on in the dog\u2019s life.

These dogs can sometimes be a little wary around strangers (especially if those strangers are other dogs) but he is loyal and affectionate with family. It is easy to tell just by looking at the Ariegeois that he is of the classic French hound type. The Ariegeois comes from the department of Ariege located in the Midi-Pyrenees region of southern France. It is a breed of scenthound and a talented courser, though its skills are also well-suited to hunting deer and boar as well. A medium-sized packing-hunting dog, the Ariegeois comes from a crossing of the Grand Bleu de Gascogne and Grand Gascon-Saintongeois breeds with local Briquet dogs native to southern France. It was first developed in 1912 which makes it a fairly young breed and, in fact, it is still relatively unknown outside its native region. It is, however, recognized by both the UKC and the FCI as a Scenthound. The Ariegeois is derived from a crossing of the Grand Bleu de Gascogne and Grand Gascon-Saintongeois with local Briquet dogs from southern France. As a medium-sized dog, the Ariegeois should be fed a high-quality dry food formulated for adult dogs and made with high-quality animal proteins.

Some breed enthusiasts divide the breed into two classifications by size \u2013 the large weighing 35 to 55 at maturity and the X-large 55 to 90 pounds.

These dogs get along well with children because they are gentle and patient \u2013 they can also do well with cats and other pets if raised with them from a young age. Although the Ariegeois will never harm a family member, he can be a little aloof or even suspicious around strangers. It is also important to realize that, although the Ariegeois is a pack hunter, he can develop low levels of dog aggression \u2013 early socialization and training are particularly important for this reason. When properly trained, however, the Ariegeois makes a wonderful family pet. The Ariegeois is relatively unknown outside its native region, so there isn\u2019t a lot of information about his health status. Generally speaking, the lifespan of the breed is a little short for a medium-sized dog but there are no specific health problems that have been linked to this breed. Some of the health problems the Ariegeois may be susceptible to include ear infections, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, cataracts, and progressive retinal atrophy as well as field injuries. The average lifespan for the Ariegeois is thought to be about 10 to 12 years which is a little low but not too outside the norm for a breed of its size.

As a scenthound, the Ariegeois may also appreciate having time and space outdoors to run and follow scents. Just be sure he is in a fenced yard or that you keep him on a leash so he doesn\u2019t follow the trail too far. As is true for many scenthounds, the Ariegeois is an affectionate and loyal breed with family. The Ariegeois is not currently recognized by the AKC but he is recognized by the FCI and the UKC.

The breed only comes in one combination of colors \u2013 a base coat of white with jet black markings. These markings typically appear on the ears, head, and face, though some dogs exhibit mottled spots all over the body. Some dogs exhibit ticking as well and many have tan markings over the eyes and on the cheeks. The average litter size for the Ariegeois breed is 3 to 6 puppies. Because these dogs grow to a maximum of 90 pounds, they can classify as a large breed which means that you need to be careful about letting your puppy grow too quickly. Overgrowth during youth can predispose your dog to musculoskeletal issues in adulthood. You can prevent this by feeding your puppy a large-breed puppy formula until he reaches 80% of his maximum size \u2013 then switch to a large-breed adult recipe.

This breed is a medium-sized scent hound formerly known as the Picard breed and he was popular for hunting during the reign of Henry IV of France. Though widely regarded as one of the best breeds for hare hunting, the Picard was rare and difficult to find during the height of his popularity. The breed remained a favorite through the 17th century but by the 19th century, it came to be crossbred with British hounds and the result was a taller, more elegant breed known as the Normand (now extinct). In the late 1800s, efforts were made to remove Normand blood from the breeding pool and by the start of the 20th century, the old Artois type had been revived but it once again fell from grace during the First and Second World Wars.

Australian bulldogs were bred with the intention of creating a more \u201cfunctional\u201d bulldog, one that had the size and strength necessary to do the job they were meant to do.

Everything that you could possibly want to know about these remarkable pooches can be found below.  The Australian Bulldog bears a striking resemblance to the Bulldog, but it has clearly been influenced by other breeds like the Bullmastiff and the Boxer. The name Australian Bulldog was given by Noel and Tina Green, the founders of the two breeding programs through which this breed was developed. The two breeding programs, N&T Green (Jag Lines) and Pip Nobes, were started separately and then merged in an effort to breed a more functional bulldog (specifically, one better adapted to the Australian environment). The first Australian Bulldog was introduced to the public in 1998 and the Aussie Bulldog Club of Australia (ABCA) was started in 2007, which runs a registration database to keep all records of breeding and memberships in one place, to help promote and develop the breed. The Australian Bulldog was bred with contributions from several breeds including the English Bulldog, the Bullmastiff, the Boxer, and the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Although similar in appearance to the English Bulldog, the Australian Bulldog has a less-squished muzzle, longer legs and less wrinkles. At first glance you might easily confuse these for the typical English Bulldog, but there are many subtle differences that are undeniable upon closer inspection. All dogs need a wholesome, well-balanced diet and the Australian Bulldog is not an exception. These hybrids are generally healthy dogs, but without the proper nutrition to support them throughout different stages of life, they can develop certain deficiencies and health issues as a result. To prevent this, only feed your Australian Bulldog high-quality food. Most owners decide on dry food as it is readily available and contains all of the essential nutrients that a dog needs. Of course, not all dry foods are made alike and it\u2019s crucial to find the mix your Australian Bulldog will thrive on. As a rule of thumb, this would mean kibble that is made from high-grade, natural ingredients, with meat being the first on the list of ingredients. Avoid kibble that contains a lot of artificial ingredients and cheap fillers. Lastly, the kibble you choose should be tailored to your dog\u2019s unique needs.  The Australian Bulldog is a medium-sized breed and should be fed a diet formulated for dogs of its size. It is also important to note that these dogs are fairly active so they may benefit from a high-quality dog food formulated for active dogs. Additionally, their kibble should be age-appropriate. Puppies, adults, and seniors all have slightly different dietary needs  Once you pick out the right type of food for your Australian Bulldog, you should make sure you\u2019re feeding them the right amounts of it. A dog of their size usually doesn\u2019t need more than 3 cups of kibble per day, but check the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for exact amounts. Split their daily dose of food into two or more meals to keep them full throughout the day and prevent bloating. As always, if you are ever concerned about any element of your dog\u2019s diet and wish to make a change, it\u2019s always wise to check in with a veterinarian first. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still guidelines and not gospel. All dogs are different after all, each with their own needs. The only person qualified to identify the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is their vet. So always rely on your vet\u2019s expertise before making any changes to your pup\u2019s diet.

This dog has a bit of a dominant streak with other dogs, so socialization will be important to counteract this tendency. From their puppyhood, these dogs should be exposed to other animals and children so you can work with them to correct any unwanted behaviors. If an Australian Bulldog grows up with other dogs or is in contact with other pets from a young age, he will be easy-going and friendly rather than dominant. Australian Bulldogs are loyal with their families and they aim to please, so they will respond well to positive reinforcement-based training methods. Use praise and treats to entice your dog to follow commands or learn where to go potty. These dogs do well with a firm, consistent hand in training and they crave leadership from their owners. It\u2019s important to establish yourself in as the alpha in the relationship, while still rooting your training in positive reinforcement and encouragement. Anything less is closer to abuse than training. Not only will you never get the results that you crave, but overly negative training will also permanently ruin your relationship with your pup.  The average male Australian Bulldog stands between 18 and 20 inches tall, weighing between 60 and 78 pounds. A female stands between 17 and 19 inches tall, weighing between 50 and 61 pounds.

However seven is the average number of littermates and is what you should expect from any pregnant Australian Bulldog mommy. That\u2019s a lot of cute in one go, y\u2019all! Almost too much (note: there\u2019s no such thing as too much cuteness, but this comes close).Tiny baby bulldogs are as adorable as they come, but you shouldn\u2019t spend all of your time \u2018aawing\u2019 and cuddling. It will be hard, but this is also an incredibly important time in a young bully\u2019s life that should not be ignored.  As is true with all dog breeds, Australian Bulldog puppies require socialization and training from a young age. Start as soon as possible, as timely work will go a long way. Those early and impressionable puppy days must never go to waste! Socialization will help these dogs to get along well with other pets as well as children.

There is perhaps no better example of that than the Australian Cattle Dog, so dubbed because it was bred in Australia for \u2013 what else? \u2013 herding cattle. Because of the terrain of Australia, this cattle dog has been bred to have plenty of endurance, cover long distances, and generally have an assertive and athletic demeanor. But if you\u2019ve found your way to this site, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re wondering about the Australian Cattle Dog as a family pet, not necessarily as a working dog. There\u2019s good news on this front: the Australian Cattle Dog is known for an up-tempo, friendly demeanor that is generally considered to be healthy enough personality-wise for a family to take home. Like any breed, this brand of dog is not without its own challenges and unique characteristics, but that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re here to explore. Let\u2019s take a closer look at this unique-looking breed and find out more about what makes the Australian Cattle Dog such a special type of dog.  The Australian Cattle Dog is known for an up-tempo, friendly demeanor, the perfect dog for a family. Just look in the name! These dogs are Australian, they\u2019re bred to herd cattle, and, well, they\u2019re dogs. Of course, anyone simply guessing about Australian Cattle Dogs is able to figure out just this much when it comes to this breed, so let\u2019s dig a little deeper and find out some more. Naturally, the history begins Down Under. While many people might associate a breed of dog, for example, the German Shepherd, as being more classic breed, the Australian Cattle Dog actually goes back even further in terms of documented history. You\u2019d have to start around 1802 if you want to learn about this breed of dog (and, if you\u2019re taking notes, the German Shepherd would officially emerge in the same century, albeit some time later). A man named Thomas Hall realized the need for a certain type of dog that would be suited to the task the Australian Cattle Dog has been named for, so he imported a number of breeds of similar type and with similar abilities and bred them. The dogs were useful and popular enough that they eventually rose under the name of Cattle Dog \u2013 throughout the 19th century, their popularity grew rapidly. Eventually they became more popular in the United Kingdom and United States, as well. When Thomas Hall imported dogs that would make up the pedigree of this breed, he found them in Northumberland, which is an area in the northern United Kingdom. The Australian Cattle Dog is styled after sheep dogs similar to this region and, not surprisingly, this is where you find much of their pedigree. Given the highly developed nature of breeds in the United Kingdom \u2013 even in the 19th Century \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say that the Australian Cattle Dog comes from a respectable and well-developed healthy pedigree. As Australian Cattle Dogs mated in Australia, they also took on some traits from local breeds that have been popular in provinces like New South Wales. Because Australian Cattle Dogs are bred for being able to handle a lot of exercise, it means they can handle a larger diet as well. Feeding your dog a healthy, active diet shouldn\u2019t add on any weight, but you might even find it hard to help the Australian Cattle Dog keep its weight on earlier in its life. Let the dog eat a healthy amount \u2013 as long as it\u2019s getting plenty of exercise. An Australian Cattle Dog\u2019s personality is fun and active. Because these dogs are a tad bit aggressive, we don\u2019t necessarily recommend the Australian Cattle Dog as your \u201cfirst\u201d dog. Its personality can be fun and active, and with proper training it will be as suitable to a social life as any other dog out there. But the issue here is your training and your ability to raise the dog to understand boundaries and remain calm and relaxed with strangers \u2013 especially other dogs. Expect a relatively light dog at around 30-35 pounds. As mentioned in our section on \u201ctraining,\u201d the Australian Cattle Dog can be excessively territorial if not properly trained. Though it can be suitable for a family, it should really be raised properly in order for it to make an ideal household pet.

These dogs can be prone to deafness and generally don\u2019t have a very long lifespan relative to other dogs of a similar size. Expect your dog to live in the range of 11-13 years, with the possible of a few years\u2019 difference in either direction. The Australian Cattle Dog has a high tolerance for exercise \u2013 but remember that \u201ctolerance\u201d also means that it should be tolerating lots of exercise on a regular basis. Since these dogs were bred to handle large distances as well as short spurts of activity, you should be able to exercise them about as much as you yourself can handle. It\u2019s a good companion for getting out of the house, although you will want to be wary of a slightly aggressive nature with other dogs.

You should bathe them once every 3 or 4 months, if they\u2019re your pet and not a show dog. Australian Terriers usually have relatively small litters, with the average being 2 to 4 puppies. This is a small breed to begin with, so be extra careful when stepping around them. Additionally, if there are children in the household, don\u2019t leave them alone to play with puppies. They could unintentionally hurt them, as they\u2019re very small and fragile in their young age. Be sure to give your Australian Terrier puppy enough exercise to drain some of that abundant energy.

With its extreme looks, this dog\u2019s body is unique in that it is taller than it is long. Named for the Azawakh Valley in the Sahara desert where this breed originated, the breed made its appearance in North America in the 1980s, making it a relatively newer furry face on the dog scene. Boasting a combination of loyalty and independence, this breed not only does well in a family household, but also as therapy dogs in nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. If you\u2019re bringing an Azawakh into a multi-dog home, you should be aware that this breed likes to be the dominant dog. The Azawakh will love its family and be fiercely protective of members of its pack. Read on to find out if this dog is the right fit for your lifestyle. Boasting a combination of loyalty and independence, this breed not only does well in a family household, but also as therapy dogs in nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. A rare West African sighthound from Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, Azawah means \u201cland of the north.\u201d The breed also goes by the following names: the Tuareg Sloughi, Rawondu, Hanshee, Aidi n\u2019Ailluli (\u201cNoble Dog of the Free People\u201d) and Idi.  These dogs would protect livestock from thieves and predators, as well as guard camps. The Azawah was prized by the Tuareg and other tribes, and regarded as members of the family. One of the reasons why this dog didn\u2019t make its way over to North America is because the Azawakh can\u2019t be bought \u2013 it has to be given as a gift. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s when Dr. Pecar, a Yugoslavian diplomat who had been stationed in Burkina Faso, brought this dog to Europe. He had received a male and female Azawakh from the nomads as a gift. The breed finally made its way to the United States in the 1980s.  Worldwide, the total number of Azawakh in existence today is probably in the low thousands, and in North America, probably about 300. Photo Credit: Azawakh Preservation International The Azawakh can trace its roots back thousands of years to the early Nigerian civilization in West Africa. This breed followed the nomadic Tuareg tribesmen, a group that migrated from the Sahel in the Southern region of the Sahara. The Azawakh share ancestors with the Saluki and Sloughi, in addition to wild jackals and wolves \u2013 the result of interbreeding thousands of years ago. But thanks to the rarity of this breed, the basic genetics of the Azawakh have remained relatively unchanged. The Azawakh is a naturally slim and athletic dog, and you want to keep this physique in top-notch condition. In its native habitat, the Azawakh lived on a low-protein diet, which consisted of the same food as its owners, mainly millet and goat milk. This breed\u2019s digestive system adapted to these conditions and diet. When compare to the average dog breed, the protein content fed to an Azawakh will be generally lower, so make sure not to overfeed your dog with high protein kibble or lots of meat. You can add some fruits and vegetables to your Azawakh\u2019s diet, such as bananas and carrots. As well, you dog will enjoy some cooked millet, pasta or wild rice thrown into the mix on occasion. The Azawakh will love its family and be fiercely protective of members of its pack. Although the Azawakhs are independent, dominant and strong-willed, this breed can get a bit timid and touchy at times. You need to be the pack leader at all times, otherwise the Azawakhs will take over. As the dominant pack leader, you must lay down the rules and ensure that they are followed in a consistent and kind manner. This breed is smart and sensitive, so you\u2019ll get better results by using reward-based positive reinforcement. You won\u2019t get anywhere with yelling, harsh treatment or physical punishment \u2013 in fact, it will damage the sense of trust and may cause your Azawakh to become fearful or aggressive. With the right owner, the Azawakh will become an amazing family companion and a champion in the ring. An Azawakh will stand about 23 to 29 inches and weight anywhere between 33 to 55 pounds. Photo Credit: Azawakh Preservation International The Azawakh can be described with a number of different terms: loyal, protective, calm, and self-confident, but also indifferent, cautious and guarded with strangers. You could even compare them to being more like a cat than a dog in many ways, as this breed is reserved, observant and independent. Your Azawakh likes to do things its own way. Make sure your dog isn\u2019t aggressive, shy or timid by exposing it to different situations and people. If you raise a nervous Azawakh, you\u2019ll have a frightened and panicky dog on your hands that may shake or bite when faced with unfamiliar situations or people. When it becomes a part of the family, an Azawakh is faithful, gentle and affectionate, bonding closely with one particular member.  It is extremely difficult to rehome an Azawakh, because this breed doesn\u2019t like to change owners. The Azawakh\u2019s guarding instinct is alive and well. This breed likes to be a part of a pack where there is an alpha leader. If you raise your Azawakh with other dogs from puppyhood, it will get along with the rest of your pack. If you have cats, you may want to consider another dog. This is a dog from Africa, so there\u2019s no surprise that Azawakhs don\u2019t like cold, wet weather. If you live in a colder climate, your dog will need a coat or sweater. An active breed, Azawakhs need to burn off its energy, otherwise it will become overweight, lethargic, hyperactive and destructive. This breed may not be the right dog for homes with smaller children. And although Azawakhs are suspicious of strangers, this breed has had much success as a therapy dog in rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. Although this is a relatively healthy breed, there are some concerns that may affect the Azawakh. Like most sighthounds, the Azawakh is sensitive to anesthesia. Because of its deep chest, this dog is prone to bloat, a condition in which the stomach expands with air. The stomach may twists on itself, cutting off blood flow and causing gastic torsion (a potentially fatal condition). Other health concerns include autoimmune mediated thyroiditis, eosinophilic myositis, heart problems, hypothyroidism, seizures and skin allergies. The Azawakh has an average lifespan of 12 to 15 years. There\u2019s no time to sit down with an Azawakh. This is an active breed that needs at least 30 to 60 minutes of running or playing every day. If you like to run, hike, bike or skate, this dog will keep up with you. You need to let this dog run, especially when playing \u2013 and this dog loves to play fetch. You should have a large, well-fenced area to run around in. Plus, your pooch will need frequent visits to the dog park to mingle and play with other dogs to burn off some of that access energy. You can\u2019t just leave them along in the backyard and expect them to run around. If this dog doesn\u2019t have any encouragement, it will get lazy. You can\u2019t keep this dog crated in. The Azawakh doesn\u2019t like to be left alone for too long \u2013 this will lead to boredom and destructive behavior. Shredding furniture, digging big holes and escaping are just a few of its undesirable pastimes. Are you looking for someone to take a road trip with? Bring the Azawakh along \u2013 this breed loves car rides and will love to go with you as you take care of errands. If you\u2019re looking for something to do with your dog, enroll your Azawakh in competitive canine sports such as lure coursing, field hunting, agility, utility, jumping, freestyle and obedience. Because it is such an active dog, the Azawakh shouldn\u2019t live in an apartment.  Although the Azawakhs are independent, dominant and strong-willed, this breed can get a bit timid and touchy at times. The American Kennel Association says this about the breed: \u201cBefitting its heritage, the Azawakh excels as a companion, guardian and a lure courser in the United States.\u201d The AKC has added the Azawakh to its Miscellaneous Class and given it a Hound group designation. Soft, short and fine, the Azawakh\u2019s coat comes in an array of colors, including different shades of brown, gray, white, black, brindle, cream, sand, grizzle, parti-color, red and blue fawn. You\u2019ll often see white markings on its legs, chest and on the tip of the tail. The Azawakh\u2019s stomach is usually hairless or features bits of fur. Thanks to its short coat, the Azawakh is a breeze to groom. All your dog needs is a good brushing or wipe-down with a damp cloth about once a week. You can also try your hand with a \u201chound glove,\u201d a grooming tool that works well on smooth-coated breeds. You\u2019ll be happy to hear that the Azawakh isn\u2019t a heavy-shedder. Bath time isn\u2019t a frequent task, because this breed doesn\u2019t have a doggy odor. When you do give your Azawakh a bath, use a mild, unscented shampoo, as this breed has thin, sensitive skin. Azawakh puppies must go to its new homes at an early age, as it\u2019s not easy to rehome an older Azawakh (due to adjustment issues). Because this is a rare breed, expect to pay a high price for a puppy. Be sure you can commit to your puppy for life before bringing it home. If you have cats or other small dogs at home, it\u2019s important to bring an Azawakh puppy into the mix as soon as possible so it can be acclimatized to its new pack.  Extensive socialization to new people, places and situations should continue throughout the Azawakh\u2019s life.

Though the exact origins of the breed are unknown, the Barbet is thought to be the common ancestor of many modern water dogs including the Poodle, the Portuguese Water Dog and the American Water Spaniel. In fact, for hundreds of years, the name Barbet and Poodle were used for the same dog in France and Germany.

A Barbet\u2019s coat may vary from wavy to color and some of the acceptable colors including solid black, brown, fawn, gray, and white. The thickness of the dog\u2019s coat helps to protect it in cold water and it also means that the breed tends to shed very little \u2013 shed fur tends to get matted into the coat rather than falling off the dog.

Poodles, for another. It seems that any breed of dog with only one word in its name must be somewhat unique and, well, considered a classic. The Beagle? No exceptions here. One of the most recognizable dogs in the world, the Beagle often has a classic brown-and-white coloring to its coat that has become synonymous with the world of pets. Heck, if there was a flag for pets, it would probably look like the coat of a Beagle.\n\n Technically a type of hound, the Beagle\u2019s unique identity is thanks to its easy-going and easy-to-get-along-with nature. It\u2019s cute enough for anyone in your household and loyal enough to melt the heart of even the most stubborn anti-dog people around. For many people, a Beagle is a perfect addition to the home \u2013 it\u2019s not often where people have to wonder if this breed is \u201cright for them.\u201d The question is: are you right for a Beagle? The Beagle\u2019s unique identity is thanks to its easy-going and easy-to-get-along-with nature. We told you Beagles are classic. Some people trace their origins back to antiquity and ancient Greece, making their direct ancestors thousands of years old. Beagles were not developed as separate breeds like many Terriers in the 19th Century; instead, the Beagle has a long and rich history across the European continent. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that the Beagle always appeared in its modern form. The history-changing William the Conqueror brought a Beagle-like hound to England, the Talbot hound. This hound gave rise to another breed of dog that is believed to be a direct ancestor to the Beagle. So the genetics of the Beagle were definitely swimming around during the high Middle Ages even if their current form wasn\u2019t quite developed. But that doesn\u2019t make them a non-classic: heck, you can say the same about the history of corn. We already mentioned the earlier ancestors of the Beagle in ancient Greece as well as the Talbot hound of William the Conqueror. These indeed play a role in the pedigree of the Beagle, but a more direct ancestor is the Southern Hound, a descendent of the old and non-existing Talbot hounds. The word Beagle itself actually comes from reference to the original smaller hounds of Europe. The pedigree of actual Beagles, however, can trace its roots to English royalty throughout the Middle Ages through Queen Elizabeth I, who owned a breed of dog known as the Pocket Beagle. As a type of hound, it\u2019s not unusual for Beagles to share dietary inclinations as do most smaller hounds. Beagles enjoy good cooked meat including poultry. If you ever cook up a lot of meat for your dog, be sure to include chopped vegetables like potatoes and carrots in order to pack in the nutrition. You can get Beagles to eat a lot of high-nutritional content if you give them meat and poultry flavor they really enjoy. You don\u2019t have to use the finest cuts of meat for your Beagle, but be sure to give them enough to get them eating what\u2019s right. Beagles are not good guard dogs, but aren\u2019t timid either. Beagles are not good guard dogs, but aren\u2019t timid either. If you want a dog to protect you, you\u2019d be better off going with a larger and more aggressive breed like a German Shepherd. Beagles are, however, very friendly and will respond to training as long as you can be patient with their learning skills \u2013 but the same is true with just about any type of dog. As a small hound, don\u2019t expect your Beagle to put up a lot of big numbers on the scale. Depending on gender and age, you can expect your Beagle to range from 25-30 pounds, give or take. For more information on a proper weight for your Beagle be sure to talk to your veterinarian. Beagles, as mentioned, are definitely not cut out for guarding you and your family, but they make excellent pets in just about every other regard. They\u2019re friendly and though they can be a little timid around strangers, they do form bonds with people they recognize and can eventually come around to enjoy even new people. Beagles are characterized as a gentle breed, excellent if you have children that want a dog that gets along with them. Beagles are not immune to a number of health problems, just like most dogs. Their large ears can trap air and lead to a good environment for ear infections, so it\u2019s important watch out for the warning signs that could suggest an infection. Like many smaller dogs, Beagles will rely on you to maintain their weight because without exercise, they\u2019ll still eat just about anything you give them. Expect your healthy Beagle to live to a good 10-13 years, a typical life expectancy for a dog of its size. Exercise is critical for maintaining a healthy weight in Beagles. Why? Because it\u2019s easy for a dog to put on a little weight that adds up. In particular, smaller dogs can be susceptible to obesity because they have so little weight to add; it doesn\u2019t take much before they become overweight. Beagles can be very feisty and active and will like a lot of good open-field experience. Be sure to exercise them daily and don\u2019t be afraid to tire them out, particularly as adults. Beagles are friendly and though they can be a little timid around strangers, they do form bonds with people they recognize. The American Kennel Club classifies the Beagle as a type of hunting dog with a \u201cmerry\u201d personality. A short coat means easy maintenance for the Beagle. Beagles do like to explore and use open fields, so it\u2019s best to keep their coats relatively clean, but in general don\u2019t expect a lot of coat maintenance. Beagle puppies are extremely popular and if your kids get a good look at one, you\u2019ll probably be asked to bring one home.

Known for being easily trained, faithful, gentle and obedient, this breed hails from France \u2013 it\u2019s not very well known outside its country of origin, but within France, it is popular, especially on farms. Also known as Bas Rouge, the Beauce Shepherd, the Berger de Beauce and the French Shorthaired Shepherd, the Beauceron is famous for its sheep herding skills and its tireless work ethic. This dog may look like a cross between a Doberman Pinscher and a German Shepherd, but we\u2019re here to tell you that the Beauceron is a special breed all its own. This muscular and imposing dog can make a loyal and trusted companion on and off the farm. Read on to find out more about this interesting breed. The Beauceron is famous for its sheep herding skills and its tireless work ethic. The first mention of a Beauceron goes back to a Renaissance manuscript of 1578. It wasn\u2019t until 1809, when a priest named Abbey Rozier wrote about this breed guarding flocks and herds. In 1863, Pierre Megnin was the first to differentiate two different types of French sheep dogs: one with a long coat, known as the Berger de Brie (Briard), and the other with a short coat, known as the Berger de Beauce (Beauceron). The Beauceron became a trusted helper to farmers as protectors of the flocks. During both World Wars, the Beauceron was used carry messages to the front lines, detect mines and carry supplies to troops. Its popularity spread to other parts of Europe before the breed made its way to North America. It\u2019s now used as a herding dog, a guard dog and a police, military, tracking and search-and-rescue dog. It is difficult to determine the exact age of the Beauceron, but it is considered to be the oldest of the large French sheepherding dogs. Related to the Briard, it is thought that the Beauceron may be able to trace its roots to the Doberman line of dogs. You\u2019ll find that the Beauceron loves to eat, but is prone to bloat. That\u2019s why you should monitor feedings and break them down to two or three small meals a day rather than one large meal. Many Beauceron owners have found that feeding this breed a home-cooked diet with lean meat, vegetables and grains promotes an overall healthy dog.

If you don\u2019t prove that you are in charge, the Beauceron will quite willingly take that position. Once you\u2019ve proven who is in charge, you\u2019ll find that your Beaucerons will flourish when it comes to basic obedience. In no time at all, you can move onto more advanced training with tricks, tracking or agility lessons. Not only does this dog need lots of exercise, it also needs plenty of mental stimulation, as boredom leads to destructive behaviors. A Beauceron will stand about 24 to 27 inches and weight anywhere between 70 to 110 pounds. Wary of strangers, the Beauceron is protective of its family. Start socialization early to prevent aggressive traits from forming. As well, Beaucerons can be aggressive with other dogs of the same sex. The Beauceron shouldn\u2019t be in a home with other pets, unless it is raised alongside other pets from its puppyhood. As we mentioned, this breed needs to be kept active or it will act out with destructive behaviors. If it is not working at something, it will be doing something else, like wreaking your furniture and digging holes in your back yard. Daily exercise, and lots of it, is a must for this dog. On the plus side, it\u2019s a great way for you to get and stay in shape. As a herding dog, the Beauceron can nip and bite. It will be protective to children within its own family, but it may try to herd them. This breed will also chase after smaller animals, so you shouldn\u2019t let your dog off-leash unless you are in a securely fenced-in area.

Because Beaucerons were bred for herding and guarding duty, this breed needs to be active. A walk around the block just won\u2019t do. Active owners will love this breed, as this dog can keep up with hikes, bikes, jogs, runs and swims. If you have a farm or a lot of room to roam, the Beauceron is the right dog for you. Daily exercise, and lots of it, is a must for the Beauceron.

The Beauceron coat can be seen in variations of black and tan. While relatively unknown outside of France, the breed is very old within the country. And while there are many sheep herding dogs in France, the Beauceron is the preferred choice due to its tireless work ethic.\u201d The AKC first recognized this breed in 2007. Sporting either a black and tan or harlequin colors, the Beauceron has a short double coat that lies flat against the body.  On black and tan Beaucerons, you\u2019ll see patches of tan above the eyes, the bottom of the upper lip and throat, spots on the breast, on the bottom of each leg and under the tail. On harlequin Beaucerons, the coat features patches of gray, black and tan in the same pattern as the black-and-tan dogs, although there should be more black than gray. Thanks to its short coat, Beaucerons don\u2019t need much grooming. This breed sheds moderately throughout the year, so a weekly brushing is recommended.  And you should give your dog a bath every few months, unless it gets dirty. It\u2019s always a good idea to start the socialization process for Beaucerons as early as possible, especially around new people and pets.

It was used to primarily to hunt vermin, but coal miners also raced the dogs for sport, as its lean body was built for speed and endurance. Bedlingtons were pitted against Whippets and often won these races. Once word got about this wonderful breed, hunters and sportsmen began to use them to catch rabbits, otters, polecats and foxes. They could hunt for extended periods of time and never get tired. They were even used in the brutal sport of dog fighting. These dogs would never instigate a fight, but once involved, would fight to the death. The debate is still on about the Bedlington Terrier\u2019s ancestry, but this breed could be the result of the Whippet, Otterhound, Kerry Blue Terrier, Rothbury Terrier, Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier or the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.

Bred to herd and protect, the Belgian Laekenois still has these instincts. Originating in Flanders, Belgium, the Belgian Laekenois is believed to have been around since the Middle Ages. These bright dogs were bred to herd and protect sheep and ensure that the flax crops were not tampered with. They were also used to stand guard over linens while they were set out to dry in the fields. Today, the Belgian Laekenois is a loyal companion who will fiercely protect his family and home. This breed\u2019s development is unknown due to the antiquity of its origin. It is one of the four known dog breeds that were developed in Belgium. Originally, all of these breeds were classified together but now are considered to be separate breeds. It\u2019s interesting to note that the Laekenois was used as a courier for the troops during both World Wars. This caused a drastic reduction in the breed\u2019s population however; concerned enthusiasts worked diligently to increase the population of the Belgian Laekenois. Because the Belgian Laekenois is an athletic and energetic breed, he needs to be fed a diet of high-quality food. Dry kibble is suggested as wet foods can cause dental and oral health problems. Although the Laekenois is a bright dog, he requires an owner who will be dedicated to regular training sessions for the life of the dog. Although the Laekenois is a bright dog, he requires an owner who will be dedicated to regular training sessions for the life of the dog. Being a herding and guard dog, this breed attaches closely to his home and family and does not like outsiders being around. Early socialization and puppy kindergarten classes can help the Belgian Laekenois to become accepting of strangers. It is important to note that without training and social skills, this breed can become aggressive with strangers. Positive training techniques work best for the Laekenois. Manhandling or other forceful methods will only increase the dog\u2019s aggression. An assertive yet kind owner using praise and yummy rewards is the key to having a well-behaved Belgian Laekenois. The Belgian Laekenois should weigh between 55 and 65 pounds and stand between 22 and 26 inches tall at the withers. Males should be larger than females. Bold and courageous, the Laekenois are quite impressive watchdogs. They are extremely protective of their families and homes however; they tend to be the pack leader as well. This domination factor can prove to be problematic. Dogs fight to determine their rankings in the pack. This, coupled with the breed\u2019s tendencies toward aggressive behavior, can be a recipe for disaster if the owner isn\u2019t assertive and consistent in keeping the Belgian Laekenois in check. He is not welcoming of strangers and can be unreliable with children and other animals. This breed is not for everybody. With proper socialization and consistent training, the Belgian Laekenois can make a trusted companion. This being said, he would always need constant supervision when children, animals or strangers are around. Again, this is not the right breed for everyone. The Belgian Laekenois is predisposed to several worrisome conditions. Because of his size and activity level, elbow and hip dysplasia has been reported. Other issues include progressive retinal apathy, pannus, cataracts, hypothyroidism and epilepsy. Gastric carcinoma, which is cancer of the stomach, has also been seen within the breed. Because of his sensitive skin, the Belgian Laekenois may have skin allergies. The Laekenois usually lives to be between 10 and 14 years old. Bred to be a herding and watchdog, the Belgian Laekenois has loads of energy and must be able to burn it off. Long walks each day will help with his exercise and socialization needs however; the dog also needs to run and play hard too. He quickly can learn to catch a Frisbee, an activity that will allow him to work a variety of muscles. Fetch is another good form of exercise. The Laekenois does well in agility, tracking, herding and other competitive dog sports. These activities require loads of training which will make the dog more social and accepting of others. Bold and courageous, the Laekenois are quite impressive watchdogs. The American Kennel Club writes: \u201cThe Laekenois\u2019 original duty, in addition to guarding and tending the flock, was to guard linen drying in the fields. The breed also served as a messenger dog during World War I and II, which decreased the breed\u2019s numbers. Many breeders worked very hard to restore this variety, while retaining the typical Belgian Shepherd Dog intelligence, type and structure. Today, the breed is still able to herd and guard its flock, and protect its people and property\u201d. The AKC first recognized the Belgian Laekenois in 2011. The Laekenois\u2019 double coat is long, rough and wooly. It is an excellent protection for the dog in inclement weather. Both straight and wavy coats are acceptable. The wool-like appearance gives the dog a tousled and unkempt look, even after he has been professionally groomed. The coats rarely form mats and are a fawn or reddish fawn in color. The muzzle and tail may have black traces and shading. The Belgian Laekenois\u2019 coat is not at all high maintenance. A thorough brushing each week should keep him looking good and his skin healthy. This breed\u2019s skin is sensitive so do not brush hard. Bathing should only be done when absolutely necessary. Puppies require loads of socialization if they are to grow up to be tolerant of other people and animals. Training and socialization should begin as soon as your new puppy comes home. Puppy kindergarten classes are a great way to do both. Laekenois puppies usually chew things up as they are teething or because they are bored. The home should be puppy-proofed prior to his arrival. Lots of hard toys and chews should be provided to divert him away from your furniture or your body.

That would be a big mistake and an unfair burden to put on the Belgian Malinois.  Although they both hail from the same general region of Europe, there are some key differences between the breeds that you\u2019ll want to be aware of. Considered good as a guard or police dog, the Belgian Malinois actually looks like the police of the dog world, strong and square and certainly ready for action. He\u2019s a pupper authority figure. Ready to keep all other dogges in line. While the Belgian Malinois can be incredibly loyal and even obedient, they\u2019re definitely not a dog for someone who isn\u2019t able to demonstrate authority over a dog. If you\u2019re a particularly passive owner who prefers a dog who develops its own personality naturally, the Belgian Malinois is probably not for you. They can be territorial and while not always aggressive, they\u2019ll need proper training and socialization from a young age to bring out their innate friendliness and general cooperation. This is not an an ideal pet for a first time dog owner. It takes a certain type of owner to keep up. Are you that type of owner? There\u2019s only one way to find out. Keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away. All will be revealed. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll either be running out to bring home a Belgian Malinois or frantically searching for a different dog. So what are you waiting for? Read on\u2026 If you don\u2019t stop and look twice, you might confuse the Belgian Malinois with a really tough-looking German Shepherd. One of four Belgian sheep dogs \u2013 that is, dogs commonly used to herd sheep \u2013 the Belgian Malinois is actually far more popular in its home country of Belgium than it is in the U.S., even despite the relative popularity of the German Shepherd. Hard to believe, but true. While there are three other breeds of Belgian sheep dogs, many have considered them all the same breed with minimal differences, such as the color of their coat. Even so, the Belgian Malinois gained American Kennel Club recognition as a breed in its own right in 1959. The breed is just that well respected. In the United Kingdom, however, the more European way of acknowledging this dog as part of a larger breed is still adopted. This can make for some confusion between the two continents, but when you see a Belgian Malinois, there can be little mistaking that you\u2019re looking at a very serious dog indeed. Closely related to its other four sheep dog breeds, the Belgian Malinois has a similar backstory to that of the German Shepherd. Being used to round up sheep and to accompany farmers in their daily work, the Belgian Malinois obviously carries its pedigree from Belgium, with a very strong Belgian identity. There can be no mistaking a Malinois for a German Shepherd should you actually visit one of the two countries. The breed was clearly developed with a number of strong qualities in mind, such as strength, agility, and a number of other physical characteristics. There is little that will actually frighten a Belgian Malinois out on the farm, although they can become territorial and a little bit wary of strangers, perhaps a relic of being on isolated Belgian farms through much of its pedigree\u2019s history. Capable of eating plenty of meat, the Belgian Malinois is a good-sized dog that will need a good-sized diet, at least relative to other dogs. Even so, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the Belgian Malinois is actually relatively small in weight compared to humans and it has a lighter frame that can be a little deceptive, so be sure not to overfeed your dog. As always, if you are in any way concerned about establishing or significantly altering your dog\u2019s diet, then it\u2019s worth consulting with a veterinarian first. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs may provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still just guidelines and will not apply to every dog. All dogs are different after all, each with their own needs. The only person qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is a vet. So always rely on their expertise before making any changes to what goes into your pup\u2019s bowl. The Belgian Malinois is actually far more popular in its home country of Belgium than it is in the U.S. Training is important to this breed. Proper training, a consistent set of boundaries and discipline, and a master with a good presence of mind will all be important. This dog is not like the Golden Retriever, where training and socialization can be quite easy. Instead, the Belgian Malinois can be territorial and fearful of strangers if not raised properly, and will become uncooperative if not trained for obedience. When trained properly, there are few dogs more loyal and obedient than the Belgian Malinois. As long as you can demonstrate authority over this dog, you should be fine. If this worries you, another breed might be more appropriate. It takes a special type of owner to train this breed. Even experienced dog owners may want to consider bringing in a professional trainer and enrolling their Belgian Malinois in obedience school. While this is a wonderful dog when properly trained, it takes extra special care to get there. So don\u2019t take on this responsibility unless you are prepared for the necessary (and significant) commitment. Weighing around 55-65 pounds, this is a larger dog with plenty of power, so be sure to treat it with the respect such a size requires. As mentioned, the Belgian Malinois can be a bit territorial and even scared of strangers, so it\u2019s important to demonstrate to the Belgian Malinois that other people are not always a threat. The Belgian Malinois\u2019 experience in Belgian farms clearly affects its overall disposition, as it is a good companion dog with a strong sense of territory. Their behavior is very obedient around the right master, but they can become a bit reckless without the right training. Like almost all dogs of its size, hip dysplasia can be an issue, but there are otherwise no major health concerns for the Belgian Malinois, making it a particularly \u201ctough\u201d breed. As always, it is important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a vet to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. A life span of 12-14 years should be expected of the Belgian Malinois, which is a relatively long and healthy life. This dog is better suited for the outdoors and the active life it brings. Living on a farm will be natural to the Belgian Malinois, because there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for exercise and play. The dog can live in apartments, but this will require a good habit of outdoor exercise in order to get the Belgian Malinois its fair share. This dog likes being free from the leash when you know it\u2019s safe for it to be so, which is best done on your own private property. When trained properly, there are few dogs more loyal and obedient than the Belgian Malinois. Says the American Kennel Club: \u201cIntelligent and trainable, the Belgian Malinois possesses a strong desire to work and is happiest with regular activity and a job to do.\u201d The coat of the Belgian Malinois should be relatively short and ready to handle a variety of weather conditions, giving it a good versatility, which is nice if you live in a colder-weather country. Some grooming may be required to ensure the coat does not get too long in areas, and regular brushing is a good idea to keep the coat and skin healthy. This is not a hard dog to keep groomed. It\u2019s important to ensure that Belgian Malinois puppies are properly trained and socialized from a very young age so they learn boundaries and are able to socialize well with people and other animals. While these puppies are undeniably adorable, it\u2019s important not to waste a moment of those early and impressionable puppy days. Starting a training and socialization program early is vital for the longterm health and obedience of any Belgian Malinois.", "facts": " AKC Herding Families with children, guard duty, houses with yards Territorial, active, hard-working, protective", "tags": "Belgian, Belgian Malinois, farm, guard dog, hip dysplasia, outdoors, service dog, watchdog, working, "}, "belgian sheepdog": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/belgian-sheepdog/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Belgian-Sheepdog-668x459.jpg", "name": "Belgian Sheepdog", "type": "dog", "text": "Elegant, sporting a lovely basic black coat, the Belgian Sheepdog is not only graceful but versatile as well.

Not only that, but their friendly temperament makes them an excellent choice for family life as well. If you\u2019re looking for a highly trainable, medium- to large-sized breed, the Belgian Shepherd is certainly one to consider. Also known as the Belgian Sheepdog, the Belgian Shepherd is a beautiful, long-coated breed that comes in a variety of colors. The Belgian Shepherd was developed in Belgium during the 1800s and, in its homeland, it is actually considered four breeds in one. During the late 1800s, a group of dog fanciers gathered native herding breeds and shepherds (such as the Dutch Shepherd, Briard, and German Shepherd) and developed what is now known as the Belgian Shepherd. Technically speaking, there are four varieties of the breed \u2013 the Malinois, the Tervuren, the Laekenois, and the Groenendael (Belgian Shepherd). In Belgium, all four are considered variations of the same breed but in many non-FCI countries (including the United States), they are regarded as separate breeds. The American Kennel Club recognizes three of the four as separate breeds \u2013 the Belgian Malinois, the Belgian Tervuren, and the Belgian Sheepdog (or Groenendael). The fourth, the LAekenois, is part of the Foundation Stock Service (FSS). The Belgian Shepherd was developed from herding breeds collected from various regions of Belgium including Tervuren, Mechelen, Laeken, and Groenendael. Breeds used in the development include the Dutch Shepherd, the Briard, and the German Shepherd. As an active herding breed, the Belgian Shepherd requires a high-quality diet rich in protein and healthy fats. If you plan to use your dog for herding or dog sports, an active or working breed formula may be the best option. Otherwise, a large-breed formula is a good place to start \u2013 just monitor your dog\u2019s weight and condition to make sure he is getting enough but not too much to eat. Like most herding breeds, Belgian Shepherds are highly intelligent and trainable. Like most herding breeds, the Belgian Shepherd is highly intelligent and very trainable. Though these dogs are generally friendly and good with people, they can sometimes be distrustful of strangers so early training and plenty of socialization is required. When properly trained, this dog is an excellent protector of his family and his property, though he will not attack without provocation. These dogs need a great deal of mental stimulation due to their intelligence, so advanced training is recommended as well as plenty of playtime with interactive toys. Though the dog is not a willful or stubborn breed, he does best with an experienced dog owner and someone who will maintain a firm and consistent hand in both leadership and training. The Belgian Shepherd is a medium- to large-sized breed in four varieties that stands between 22 and 26 inches tall, weighing 44 to 66 pounds at maturity. Males of the breed are larger than females. The Belgian Shepherd is a highly intelligent breed that excels in herding as well as other dog sports. These dogs are extremely alert, observant, and sensitive to everything that happens around them which is partially why they are so good at herding. Though they were developed as a herding breed, this dog also does well as a family pet because he is loyal, trainable, and good with children. This breed does require a significant amount of exercise and socialization, but they are naturally very gentle and they enjoy close interaction with people. The Belgian Shepherd is generally a healthy breed, though he is prone to eye problems, skin problems, hip dysplasia, epilepsy, and gastric torsion. The average lifespan for the Belgian Shepherd is 10 to 14 years which is fairly long for a dog of his size. The Belgian Shepherd is a highly active and energetic breed, so he requires at least an hour of vigorous exercise each day. In addition to plenty of physical exercise, this breed needs plenty of mental stimulation as well. If he is under-exercised or bored, the Belgian Shepherd is prone to destructive behavior so keep plenty of interactive toys on hand. The Belgian Shepherd is a highly intelligent breed that excels in herding as well as other dog sports. The Belgian Shepherd is recognized by the AKC in the Herding Group. The Belgian Shepherd name applies only to the Groenendael variety in the United States \u2013 the Tervuren, Malinois, and Laekenois are recognized separately. Each of the four varieties of Belgian Shepherd has a slightly different coat. The Groenendael has a long, double coat consisting of soft, short down hairs and a longer top layer of coarse guard hairs \u2013 solid black is the most common coloration. The Laeknois is generally fawn-colored with white hairs mixed in and the texture of the coat is wiry. The Malinois has a shorter coat in various shades of brown or tan with agouti-ticked hairs in varying degrees of black \u2013 they also have a black mask and ears. The Tervuren is similar in coloration to the Malinois but has a longer double coat. The average litter size for the Belgian Shepherd is 6 to 10 pups. Because there are four varieties of Belgian Shepherd, litters can be extremely variable depending on breeding. Regardless of physical appearance, all Belgian Shepherds require early socialization and training. Because they are a large breed, you also need to be careful about preventing them from growing too fast \u2013 a large-breed puppy formula should solve this problem.", "facts": " AKC Herding Group active singles, active families, house with a yard active, friendly, trainable, intelligent", "tags": "Belgian Sheepdog, Belgian Shepherd, Belgium, herding, herding breed, "}, "belgian tervuren": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/belgian-tervuren/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/belgian-tervuren.jpg", "name": "Belgian Tervuren", "type": "dog", "text": "With his expressive eyes and gorgeous long coat, one would think that the Belgian Tervuren is simply just a beautiful dog that would lie around the house looking pretty. Nothing is further from the truth. Although he does enjoy relaxing on the couch with his family, the Belgian Tervuren is athletic, agile and has an undying work ethic. He is brave and protective of his family, making him a great candidate for being a watchdog as well as a companion. Known to enthusiasts as the Terv, this breed is one of the Belgian dogs bred to heard and protect sheep. Because of their intense herding instincts, Belgian Tervurens might very well help you round up your children. To learn more about this beautiful and loyal breed, read on. The Belgian Tervuren is athletic, agile and has an undying work ethic. Originating in the farming village of Tervuren in Belgium, the Belgian Tervuren swiftly became the all-purpose dog that villagers had longed to have. In the 1800s, his keen herding skills and protective nature proved to make him a great asset to the farmers and their families. One of the most mysterious breeds of dog, the Belgian Tervuren\u2019s ancestry is unknown until the 1890s. The establishing farmers were not at all concerned about producing dogs for their rich pedigrees; they merely wanted dogs that would perform a job. During the World Wars, the Terv nearly became extinct however; some breeders continued to work on its development. The Tervs that we know today have longhaired Belgian Malinois and Groenendael blood behind them. Because the Belgian Tervuren is an active dog, he needs to be fed a high-quality diet specifically formulated for his activity level. Dry food is best as it will prevent oral health problems such as gum disease, caries and bad breath that are associated with feeding wet foods. Of course, the amount of food the Terv needs will depend upon the level of his activities. Belgian Tervurens are highly intelligent however; they can be stubborn and have minds of their own. Tervs love showing off how smart they are and do very well in obedience, herding and agility trials as well as in the breed ring. These dogs are truly versatile and can go from looking gorgeous in the breed ring, to being brilliant in obedience classes, to being a supreme athlete on the agility course and then sporting their skills in herding trials without batting an eye. It is obvious that Belgian Tervurens enjoy training sessions, so long as their trainer is kind, assertive and carries lots of yummy treats. The Belgian Tervuren weighs between 40 and 70 pounds and stands between 21 and 26 \u00bd inches tall at the withers. Belgian Tervurens are highly intelligent however; they can be stubborn and have minds of their own. Loving, intelligent and loyal companions, Belgian Tervurens bond closely with their families and will protect them fiercely. Provided they get lots of exercise, they can be quite calm and relaxed in the home. Without proper exercise, they can begin herding kids and adults as well as nip at them. Chasing people, bicycles, cars and other animals is inherent in the breed so it is essential that Tervs be kept on a leash unless they are in a secured area. Boredom can cause the Belgian Tervuren to chew up belongings, bark incessantly and even chew on himself. These are signs of separation anxiety so for the most part; they should not be left alone for long periods of time. Elbow and hip dysplasia are the two most common afflictions within the breed. Although breeders do all that they can to cut down on the incidences of them, they are still problematic. Environmental factors can exacerbate any potential elbow or hip problem. Keeping puppies off slippery floors, limiting their exercise and keeping them from jumping on and off the furniture can decrease the risk of development. Other issues can be PRA or progressive retinal apathy and epilepsy. The average Belgian Tervuren lives to be between 10 and 12 years of age. Being that the Belgian Tervuren was bred to herd and protect livestock, this dog is athletic and needs lots of exercise. An hour or so of playing with the kids, fetching a ball or jogging through the park will keep the average Terv in tip-top condition both physically and mentally. Because of their tremendous chase instinct, this breed should only be exercised on a leash or in a securely fenced area. Loving, intelligent and loyal companions, Belgian Tervurens bond closely with their families and will protect them fiercely. The American Kennel Club writes: \u201cPrior to the Industrial Age, the rural farmers of Belgium had a great need for a general purpose herding and guard dog. The protective instinct of these dogs provided security for the farm and the family, and their herding abilities assisted with the daily maintenance of the stock. With industrialization, the rural farm dog became less important, but the Terv continued to be cherished as a family companion.\u201d The Belgian Tervuren was recognized by the AKC in 1959. The long and thick topcoat of the Terv might look like it would be soft but it is actually a bit harsh to the touch. The thick and downy undercoat keeps the dogs protected from the cold. They have a small mane and sport some hair tufts on their eyes. Tervs have a black mask but the rest of their bodies can range in color from fawn to mahogany. The fur is tipped with black as are the tails and ears. This breed has a double coat and they constantly shed, all the year through. Bathing is only needed once each season of the year, unless the dog gets into something malodorous. It\u2019s best to brush a Belgian Tervuren daily but if you haven\u2019t the time to do that, twice weekly thorough brushing sessions will help to keep his coat looking great and his skin feeling healthy. Belgian Tervuren puppies are incredibly sweet and handsome but they are also bundles of energy. They will need enough activity to keep him fit and happy but not so much to potentially damage his hips and elbows. Early training and socialization is very important as they are strong-willed and can become aggressive toward strangers when they become adults.

The Bergamasco Sheepdog is often described as strong, sound and brave; qualities that are essential in a herding breed. They are highly intelligent and capable of thinking independently, and are very easy to train with positive reinforcement. These dogs are still used in many regions in Europe as herders. They also make excellent competitors for dog agility trials, obedience, flyball, tracking, showmanship and herding events. Many Bergamascos have also found homes as guard dogs and companion dogs. The Bergamasco Sheepdog looks more like a dreadlocked Rasta than anything else. Bergamascos are an ancient breed with a history of over 2000 years. It is believed that they originated from the ancient sheepdogs used in Persia. The Persian shepherds that migrated eastwards ultimately settled in the valley of Bergamo in the Italian Alps, hence the breed\u2019s name. The breed has remained relatively unchanged since then. Bergamasco Sheepdog populations reached all-time lows at the close of World War II as demand for wool and sheepdogs declined. It took the dedicated efforts of an Italian breeder named Dr. Maria Andreoli to save and revive the breed during the 1960s. The first Bergamscos were introduced to the United States around 1990 and they still remain a relatively rare breed. It is believed that much of the Bergamasco\u2019s pedigree is attributed to the ancient long-coated dogs used by the very first shepherds in the Zagros Mountains. Much of the Bergamasco\u2019s characteristics are those of its ancient ancestors and remain unchanged, with certain traits introduced to the breed by environmental and historical changes. Bergamasco Sheepdogs can be fed on a varied diet of kibble and high quality raw/canned foods. They should be fed twice a day, once in the morning and again in the evening. Puppies, however, can be fed three times a day. Bergamascos are an extremely intelligent breed of dog and are capable of independent thought and action. Bergamascos are an extremely intelligent breed of dog and are capable of independent thought and action. This makes them extremely receptive to positive reinforcement based training techniques. In ancient times, when Bergamascos were tasked with guarding large flocks of sheep or cattle with little supervision, it was imperative that they be able to think for themselves and make quick decisions. However, this also means that when faced with a lack of leadership, they can be willful and stubborn. Therefore it is important to provide them with assertive and consistent leadership. The ideal weight for a full-grown Bergamasco male ranges from 70 to 84 pounds. Bergamascos are generally a peaceful and well-balanced breed of dog. However, they do require rules, boundaries and limitations in addition to love and attention in order to lead a healthy life. Faced with a lack of leadership, they can sometimes view themselves as equals in a human pack as opposed to subordinates. Although not an aggressive breed, Bergamascos do make good guard dogs because they are naturally suspicious of strangers. However, they will not attack unless they feel that their family is directly under threat. Bergamascos are extremely caring and playful with children and have even been used in therapy work with disabled children. The presence of children seems to awaken their natural guarding and herding instincts. They also get along well with other dogs and animals, provided that they are socialized well from an early age. Bergamasco Sheepdogs are generally a very healthy breed and do not suffer from any hereditary health problems. A well cared for Bergamasco will enjoy a healthy lifespan of around 10-15 years. As a working breed of dog, Bergamascos require a great deal of exercise and are unsuitable for owners that aren\u2019t physically active. They thrive when raised in large farms or vast properties where they can run about freely and exercise by themselves. As a highly intelligent and independent breed, they also require \u2018meaningful\u2019 tasks with which to occupy themselves with.

The AKC has this to say about the Bergamasco Sheepdog: \u201cA sheepdog with a strong work ethic, the Bergamasco\u2019s most unique characteristic is its coat, which contains \u201cdog hair,\u201d \u201cgoat hair\u201d and \u201cwool\u201d that combine to form black or gray felt-like mats. The mats grow over the course of the dog\u2019s life, reaching the ground at approximately 6 years of age. The coat can actually smell like a sweater when it is wet. But despite its formidable appearance, the Bergamasco is really a trim, athletic sheepdog.\u201d The Bergamasco was first recognized by the AKC in 1997. The Bergamasco\u2019s coat is made up of three distinctive layers. The undercoat is fine, dense and oily, and forms a waterproof layer. The second layer is long and wiry like that of a goat\u2019s. The third layer is wooly and entwines with the second layer to form the Bergamasco\u2019s distinctive dreadlock-like coat. And despite their ragged appearance, these dogs do not require much grooming; two to three baths a year and occasional brushing is more than adequate to keep the coat in good health. Bergamasco puppies are highly energetic and playful. They should be socialized with humans and other animals at a very young age.", "facts": " Miscellaneous Class Families with children, active singles, farms/rural areas Vigilant, determined, patient, intelligent", "tags": "Bergamasco, dog agility trials, flyball competition, guard dog, herding, intelligent, Persia, sheep guarding, tracking, "}, "berger blanc suisse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/berger-blanc-suisse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/berger-blanc-suisse.jpg", "name": "Berger Blanc Suisse", "type": "dog", "text": "Though the Berger Blanc Suisse (also known the White Swiss Shepherd Dog or Snowy Shepherd) looks remarkably similar to both the White Shepherd and the White German Shepherd, all three of these dogs are separate breeds.

Originally farm dogs, they\u2019re accustomed especially to country life and have a general ability to get along with animals of different species like horses and cows, making them ideal for, of course, farmers. But not having a farm is no reason to ignore a breed like the Bernese Mountain Dog. With a good instinct for guardianship as well as a healthy disposition toward outdoor activity and a general sociability, this dog is versatile enough to make a great pet for your family. Perhaps it\u2019s appropriate that this breed often wears three colors, because it\u2019s also capable of handling a variety of roles around your house, as well.

This helps explains its versatility and natural disposition when in open fields and in the country. Interestingly, the Bernese Mountain Dog was used during the Civil War as a war dog but eventually its numbers for this purpose declined. The breed was revitalized in the United States later on, and today enjoys a new popularity both in Switzerland and in the U.S. Back in Switzerland, the breed was at one point referred to as the \u201cGodly\u201d as a reference to a village where they were believed to have spent a lot of time in. The pedigree of Bernese Mountain Dog rests in the Sennenhund, a specifically Swiss brand of dog that is typically in the mid-sized range and displays a great versatility. As a standard breed, the Bernese Mountain Dog finally found classification at the turn of the 20th Century and today enjoys a history all its own. With a heavy and multi-colored coat, many people like to feed their Bernese Mountain Dog with the idea of aiming for a specific coat quality. However, a simple, healthful diet is often enough to ensure that a good coat quality is maintained as well as an overall healthy weight \u2013 which we\u2019ll address in just a moment. The Bernese Mountain Dog can be fond of scraps but generally you\u2019ll want to keep it well-fed with its own food to discourage this relatively large breed from hanging around under the dinner table.

Be sure to socialize your dog properly and give it plenty of introductions in order to facilitate a healthy attitude toward strangers as well as other dogs.

This dog can be considered a large toy dog and, while it looks similar to the Maltese, does have some distinctions that make it a breed in and of itself. And although the fluffy white coat can intimidate potential dog owners who don\u2019t like the idea of a lot of grooming, the Bichon Frise is surprisingly low-maintenance, meaning that they\u2019re not big shedders and won\u2019t be a hamper on that roommate of yours with dog allergies.

This curious dog is known as the Bichon Frise, French for \u201ccurly white lap dog.\u201d The Bichon Frise is, predictably, a French breed. As you can glean from the root word \u201cBich,\u201d the name of the dog has its root in quite literal and old French translations. Like the Maltese, the different Bich breeds came from the Mediterranean area and have a long history throughout the Europe and European trade. Sailors would bring similar breeds around with them and, thanks to its cheerful personality, these dogs would be a hit, especially in locations like Spain. Later on, Italian nobility found these breed types to be very enjoyable and no doubt gave them plenty of lap time. This background in sailing can still be evidence as the breed can sometimes enjoy swimming and retrieving, although the Bichon Frise is certainly not a hunting or retrieval dog. Throughout history, the Bichon Frise has enjoyed French attention from the courts of Napoleon III to the streets of Paris. The breed was formally recognized in the recent centuries just as many dog breeds have been. The Water Spaniel and the Standard Poodle resemble the Bichon Frise and it\u2019s no wonder: those can be considered two direct ancestors to the Bichon Frise. The Barbet Spaniel \u2013 sometimes another name for the Water Spaniel \u2013 should be noted, as you may find some articles that reference this pedigree. The dog found a variety of homes over the ages in countries like Spain, France, and Italy and have even traveled to the Canary Islands before being transported back to the European homeland. These breeds \u2013 like the Maltese and the Bichon Frise \u2013 have enjoyed a rich and varied history as being a favorite to nobility and royalty as well as the more common classes throughout Europe. Their cheerful personalities have been a favorite even leading into the modern era. Whole foods including good cuts of meat are great for the Bichon Frise. It might be easy to spoil them, but be sure that they receive a steady diet of whole, natural foods that they\u2019ll be able to enjoy. Don\u2019t over feed them. Italian nobility found these breed types to be very enjoyable and no doubt gave them plenty of lap time. Generally, the Bichon Frise is a worry-free dog in terms of training, perhaps a reason they were so popular in the trading world of Europe where it would be easy to acquire a dog and acclimate it to ventures such as sailing and bartering. It might require a little bit of patience to deal with the Bichon Frise if you\u2019re a first-time dog owner, but proper training will go a long way in this breed. Being sure to socialize this dog with other dogs early on is a good idea. Larger than the Maltese in many cases, the Bichon Frise should weigh anywhere from 10-20 pounds, depending on its overall frame and possibly its gender. This is a small dog appropriate for laps and if you notice your dog feeling a little bit too cumbersome on your lap while you\u2019re watching television, then you can be pretty sure that you\u2019ll want to give your dog more exercise. Cheerful and energetic, the Bichon Frise was a favorite with old European sailors just as they are in homes across Europe and America today. Let\u2019s talk about your health for a moment: the Bichon Frise is considered an allergy-friendly dog that has been bred to work well with humans who are allergic.

If you are in the market for a rugged and strongly muscled working dog, then look no further than the Black Mouth Cur. This breed is a medium-to-large sized dog that is named after the black coloration on its muzzle. This is a serious dog for serious dog owners. Black Mouth Curs are often referred to as \u201cmultitalented\u201d dogs because they can be trained for a variety of tasks including hunting, herding, and general utility. Yet, they aren\u2019t just dogs who are bred to work. Black Mouth Curs also make great family pets! This attractive and intelligent breed is an excellent option for families with or without children because they form very strong bonds with their humans and they respond well to training.  Even so, these energetic and driven dogs are not a good choice for first-time dog owners, as they need a firm hand and someone who can keep up with their zest.

If you are looking for a rugged, strongly muscled working dog then look no further than the Black Mouth Cur. The exact origins of the Black Mouth Cur are unknown, but it is thought to have been developed from various ancient European and Asian cur-type dogs. What is known is that the breed was developed in the Southern United States as an all-purpose farm dog and that the breed has become fairly widespread since the 19th century. These pups have a long and rich history as working dogs on farms and they serve their masters well.  While some believe the term \u201ccur\u201d implies a mixed breed dog, the Black Mouth Cur is actually purebred. Some of the breeds from which the Black Mouth Cur may have been developed include the Southern Black Mouth Cur originating in Alabama, the Foundation Black Mouth Cur from Texas, and the Ladner Yellow Black Mouth Cur that came from Mississippi. There is a rich history to this beloved animal. The Black Mouth Cur is thought to have descended from various ancient European and Asian cur-type herding and hunting dogs. So. they will arrive in your home ready to get to work. This breed also shares some characteristics with the Catahoula Cur, namely its webbed toes. Given that the Blackmouth Cur is a medium- to large-sized breed, it is best to use a large-breed dog food formula. If you plan to use your dog for hunting or herding, make sure to use a dog food formulated for active dogs to provide your Black Mouth Cur with the energy he needs. These dogs will require a diet that will keep their powerful bodies bursting with energy. As always, consider consulting with your vet to determine the best possible diet. If you intend  for your Blackmouth Cur to be a highly active working dog, he may require a special diet and portion control to keep him healthy, happy, and filled with the energy that you\u2019ll need. While there are plenty of foods out there that will promise to fulfill those needs, only your vet can determine what is right for your working dog and their specific needs. The Black Mouth Cur is a very intelligent breed and he is eager to please his owners. The Black Mouth Cur is a very intelligent breed and he is eager to please his owners. However, it is important that his training regime be firm and consistent. This dog needs to know that his owner is the boss and the owner must not waver in his control of the dog. Otherwise, they simply won\u2019t respond to your training. That being said, please don\u2019t confuse assertiveness and positioning yourself as a pack leader with aversive training methods. Yelling, hitting or punishing a dog is not only cruel, but counterproductive as well. Those methods of dog training and dated and cruel. That\u2019s animal abuse, plain and simple. You won\u2019t get the results that you need through those methods. Instead, rely on positive reinforcement methods  and motivate your pet to learn with treats and praise.  Training should be started as early as possible with puppies and continue throughout the dog\u2019s early life to solidify his obedience.  Start with the essentials, such as potty training and leash training. Teaching commands such as fetch or \u201cdrop it\u201d is also a great idea. After that, you can expand the repertoire of commands if the dog shows eagerness to learn. In addition to training, you should make sure to socialize your dog early and often. Early exposure to other pets and children will help with behavioral guidance from the owner.  Black Mouth Curs can be trained for a variety of purposes including hunting, herding, coursing, agility, and even Search and Rescue. These dogs love having a job to perform. This will also mean that they\u2019re unhappy when they don\u2019t have a task to occupy themselves with, so make sure to always have something for them- lest they become destructive. This is not a dog that will live in apartment and take short walks every day. This is a big dog with big needs. If you can\u2019t provide the space, attention, and tasks that Black Mouth Curs need, you shouldn\u2019t even consider bringing one into your home.  The weight range for Black Mouth Curs is between 50 and 100 pounds, with males typically being larger than females. The reason for the significant variation in this weight range is related to the fact that there are several different \u201ctypes\u201d within the breed. Each type, or variation, is named for the kennel or family by which it was developed. Males typically weigh between 40 and 95 pounds, while females weighing in at 35 to 80 pounds. The variation in size between Black Mouth Curs is entirely dependant on breeding.  Brave and intelligent, the Black Mouth Cur truly is the Jack of all trades of the canine world. They are quite versatile and adaptable, and will be happy as long there\u2019s a task for them to do. This breed is oriented towards work before everything else. So without a job, they tend to get depressed and destructive really quickly. In addition to their energy, this is the main reason why this type of dog is not a good choice for the apartment dweller. These dogs are made for country living and wide open spaces. While primarily a working dog with impressive smarts and a fierce drive to please their owner, the Black Mouth Cur is also a great companion. Their capability and need for service certainly don\u2019t overshadow their affectionately sweet nature and devotion to owners. Ideally, they should be paired with an active and outdoorsy family that would understand its need for exercise. The Black Mouth Cur also makes a great family pet as long as it is trained and socialized from a young age. These dogs form very close bonds with their family and have been known to be incredibly protective and loyal. When exposed to children starting from their puppy days, Black Mouth Curs can get along well with kids of any age. Of course, supervision is recommended for very young children because the dog may not know to be gentler with them. Their energetic view of playtime can be a bit rough for smaller kids, as they could knock them over unintentionally. So it might not be the best idea to bring a Black Mouth Cur into a home with an infant or toddler. Older children, on the other hand, will fall in love with these playful and loyal animals almost instantly.  This breed is typically not aggressive with humans, even though they can be somewhat territorial. Due to its hunting instincts and high prey drive, it is not recommended that you leave this dog alone with non-canine pets. That\u2019s a story that won\u2019t end well. The Black Mouth Cur is generally considered to be a very healthy breed. Since it is used primarily as a working dog, any genetic defects that might hamper its abilities were quickly culled from the gene pool. These are tough animals who in the past led tough lives. There are, however, certain conditions to which the Black Mouth Cur is prone. These conditions include ear infections, eye problems, skeletal problems, epilepsy, and mange. So, regular visits to the vet are recommended to keep on eye on the development of these specific ailments. The average life expectancy of the Black Mouth Cur is between 12 and 16 years. The Black Mouth Cur is considered a medium energy breed. It requires a daily brisk walk as well as plenty of outdoor space to run and play. If you live in an apartment, this dog will not be a good choice for you. They need to live on a farm or a house with a big, securely fenced backyard. Otherwise they will become depressed and even destructive.   On average, at least 60 minutes of deliberate exercise is recommended for this breed. And that\u2019s not the mention the activity they\u2019ll do on their own, roaming about the yard or occupying themselves with their job. So don\u2019t even consider bringing home one of these big and burly pups unless you\u2019re certain that you can keep up! This breed does particularly well when trained for hunting, herding, or another sport that keeps it active and engaged. If anything, they need that type of task to give them purpose and keep them happy. Lack of exercise for this breed can lead to the development of behavioral problems. In addition to training for a task, you can make sure your pet is occupied by offering them puzzle toys. Interactive toys can keep an intelligent dog such as the Black Mouth Cur entertained for hours on end. The Black Mouth Cur makes a great family pet as long as it is trained and socialized from a young age. No cur breeds are currently recognized by the AKC but the Black Mouth Cur is considered a member of the Herding Group by the UKC. The Black Mouth Cur first caught the interest of the UKC in the late 1990s but the AKC shows no interest in accepting the breed for registration. The Black Mouth Cur has a short coat that comes in a wide variety of colors including red, yellow, fawn, white, and piebald. The UKC breed standard states that up to 10 percent of the coat may be white and that white on the toes, tail, nose, and chest is acceptable. Because the coat if this breed is so short, it is relatively easy to groom. The Black Mouth Cur simply requires occasional brushing to remove loose hairs. The average litter size for the Black Mouth Cur is between 3 and 9, though litters of up to 10 have been reported. While they\u2019re still in their formative period of life, the Black Mouth Cur puppies need to go through basic socialization and training. Failing to do so could lead to your new pet growing up to have behavioral issues and bad manners. Establishing your alpha nature in the relationship early is important. So be sure to start their training early and be diligent. It might mean extra effort early, but that will pay off for a lifetime.

Developed by the post World War II Soviet Union, the Black Russian Terrier or BRT, is not a true terrier, and is instead categorized as a working dog. The BRT is a fairly large dog and has a powerfully built body. Both its forelegs and hindquarters are well-boned and muscular, and end in large, padded feet. The BRT\u2019s head is fairly large and block shaped and is equipped with a powerful set of teeth that meet in a scissor bite. The BRT\u2019s body is covered in a thick double coat. The outer-coat is coarse and wiry while the thick undercoat is soft to the touch. The BRTs coat is black and sometimes has a few stray grey hairs. Brown or white markings are considered to be a fault. BRTs are extremely intelligent and self-assured dogs. Bred primarily as guard dogs, they have extremely strong protective instincts and are devoted to their owners. Their strong personalities do however require owners with a thorough understanding of dog psychology and leadership. The Black Russian Terrier is a low-maintenance and hard working dog. The Black Russian Terrier was developed by the former USSR\u2019s state owned Red Star Kennel. The breed was developed specifically to serve as a military/working dog. The primary goal when developing the BRT was to create a low-maintenance and robust dog that was also high-spirited and able to adapt to various tasks and climatic conditions. Until 1957 the BRT was bred solely by the Red Star Kennel, and the kennel bred specimens, although similar in temperament and character, would vary in appearance. However, once the Black Russian Terrier was made available to civilian breeders, efforts were taken to standardize their \u201clook\u201d while at the same time retaining their temperament and physical capabilities. It is believed that the breeding stock used to develop the Black Russian Terrier came mainly from the USSR occupied territories. Their pedigree includes crossings of over 20 distinct breeds such as the Airedale Terrier, Caucasian Ovcharka, Newfoundland, Giant and Standard Schnauzer and the Moscow Water Dog. Black Russian Terriers should be fed on 3.5-4 cups of high quality dog food divided into two meals a day.

They do however have strong personalities and should be handled with a loving but firm hand from an early age. BRT puppies are inquisitive and playful and some adults too display this extreme curiosity. Black Russian Terriers often excel at various obedience competitions and dog sports such as agility and Schutzhund training. Fully grown Black Russian Terriers weigh between 80 to 140 pounds. Black Russian Terriers were bred to have a hard work ethic and therefore need a \u201cmeaningful\u201d job to lead a happy and balanced life. They are also a highly energetic breed and require at least an hour of rigorous exercise each day. When not provided with an outlet to release their excess energy Black Russian Terriers can become extremely hyperactive and develop various behavioral issues. Black Russian Terriers have a very strong guarding instinct that kicks in around two years of age. They are extremely brave and highly devoted to their owners. They are also naturally suspicious of strangers and do not take well to intruders. However, they rarely bark excessively unless they feel that it is absolutely required. These qualities make the BRT an excellent modern-day guard dog. BRTs also get along extremely well with children and love to frolic and play with them. They also get along well with other household pets and animals. However, problems can arise when housing a Black Russian Terrier with another large and dominant dog as BRTs have very strong personalities. Therefore it is imperative that owners be able to maintain dominance and leadership over both dogs. The Black Russian Terrier is a fairly healthy breed of dog. However, they do suffer from a few hereditary conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia and Hyperuricosuria. When well cared for, a Black Russian Terrier will often enjoy a lifespan of 10-14 years. A responsible BRT owner will ensure that his or her dog gets at least an hour of rigorous exercise each day.

Despite its name, the Black Russian is a member of the Working Group and not the Terrier Group. Their tousled double coat must be coal black and coarse in texture.\u201d A Black Russian Terriers coat should be brushed 2-3 times a week and requires a trim at least twice a year. Owners should take care to remove any dead hair from the dog\u2019s ear ducts and to trim the hair under its paws. BRTs are light shedders.

To learn more about this fascinating breed, read on. Keep your eyes glued to this page and all will be revealed. A strong and impressive dog, the Boerboel is protective and loyal to his family. The Boerboel is also known as South African Mastiff. As you may have guessed, their name name reveals the birthplace of these majestic canines. Sources indicate that the Boerboel might have been created as early as the 1600s, probably in the territory of Cape Town. The name \u201cBoerboel\u201d means farmer\u2019s dog in Afrikaans/Dutch. So, it\u2019s easy to surmise that the breed was originally put to work as defenders of homesteads. Their imposing size and trainability made the Boerboel a perfect guard dog, one that would protect his territory and family- and certainly one that has means to do it. In 1652, a man named Jan von Riebeeck traveled to South Africa with his family and dog, a Bullenbitjer. This was a large, Mastiff style of dog. The dog was quite prolific and bred with local canines pretty aggressively. After throwing down some impressive breeding numbers, the Boerboel was born. Well, according to one school of thought anyways. Others believe that the Bullenbitjer bred with other large dogs brought by settlers to South Africa. Over dozens of years, only the strongest and healthiest survived. In 1820, British settlers moved to the area and they brought Bulldogs, Mastiffs and later, Bull Mastiffs. There is also a belief that the result of these varied combinations were crossed with long-legged English Bulldogs, which resulted in the modern day Boerboel. As with any hybrid, it\u2019s tough to pinpoint the exact origin of the Boerboel. However, at least there are believable origins to this crossbeed, which isn\u2019t true of most hybrids. We have a rough idea of how they were initially bred and at least know the country of origin. That\u2019s at least something. All dogs need a high-quality and nutritionally dense diet, but large and athletic breeds such as the Boerboel need it more than most. Premium dry food for dogs is a good fit for this breed, as long as it is suitable for their unique needs. Make sure to pick out a brand that uses natural ingredients with a high protein ration and one that is specially formulated to meet the needs of a big and active dogs. Ontop of that, you should make sure that their kibble is age appropriate. Boerboel puppies grow fast and will need special kibble to support that growth. Large breed puppy formula is a safe bet in that regard.  Some Boerboel owners prefer to feed their pets raw or BARF diet, believing that it is more beneficial for their canines. If you decide on taking the alternative route and skip on commercial pet food, make sure to consult a vet first. It\u2019s easy to misjudge what nutrients and how much of them a big dog needs, and you wouldn\u2019t want your pet to get sick. It\u2019s always important to seek out the advice of a vet before making any major changes to your dog\u2019s diet. While pet blogs and pet food manufacturers provide useful guidelines, they should not be treated as gospel. Only your vet can identify the specific dietary needs of your personal pup. So always rely on your vet to guide in you the right direction to feed your pooch what they need.  The big build dictates the amount of food these dogs need, too, in addition to its type. You should be aware of the financial aspect of feeding a Boerboel. Not only that they require high-grade food, but they need a lot of it. It can be a bit much for your budget if you aren\u2019t prepared. These dogs will need big bowls of food to thrive and that always costs more than most pet owners anticipate.  Firm and consistent training is necessary for the Boerboel to coexist successfully with human families. Firm and consistent training is necessary for this breed to coexist successfully with human families. This is a bright breed that is strong-willed and will do all things possible to become the Alpha dog in the pack. This can never be allowed to happen. The Boerboel must have an assertive owner who quickly establishes themself as the alpha. It\u2019s also important to ensure that the dog has daily training sessions, even if they are continuously going over the same commands. Every member of the family must continuously be seen as above the Boerboel in the dog\u2019s mind. Training can help do this. All training should be done using positive methods and a treat based reward system. Harshness or manhandling the Boerboel will only lead to resentment and aggression. That approach far closer to abuse than training and Boerboel won\u2019t respect it or comply with it. This dog wants to be the Alpha dog in the pack. Your family is his pack. A dominant and solid pecking order must be established and maintained in order to have a peaceful and pleasant existence with the Boerboel. A loving yet firm hand is required. Not all dog owners are up for this. Boerboels would not do well with first time or lazy dog owners. These pooches require a specific type of human who can meet their unique needs. The average Boerboel should weigh between 110 and 175 pounds. They should be somewhere between 24 and 27 inches tall at the withers. In other words, these are big beautiful boys. You will notice when they enter a room. The Boerboel can be an obedient and reliable companion, provided he has had proper socialization and training. Although this breed is generally good with his own family, Boerboels should be watched carefully with young children. They do have the tendency to dominate all those around, including their own families. That behavioural trait won\u2019t exactly mix well with small children. Brave, fiercely loyal, and undeniably powerful, the Boerboel makes an incredible watchdog or guard dog. He is so protective of his family that he would be willing to give up his own life to ensure that they are safe. This can be a recipe for disaster when friends or family visit. The Boerboel does not readily accept people into his home. Nor does he welcome other pets. Proper introductions and a watchful eye are necessary when visitors are around. This is not an acceptable breed for families with small pets, such as cats, rabbits and the like. That won\u2019t end well. Playtime is necessary for the Boerboel. He is playful with his family and loves toys and balls. On the downside, this breed has incredibly strong jaws. The toys will be destroyed rather quickly, so be sure to pencil a budget in for dog toys. Buy them in bulk and don\u2019t get attached. Boerboels will rip through any toy, no matter how much they love it. Although generally a healthy breed, the Boerboel is prone to hip and elbow dysplasia. This is quite common in very large breeds of dogs. Eye problems such as Entropion and Ectropion have also been found in the breed. To minimize the potential of genetic health issues, don\u2019t buy your Boerboel puppy from puppy stores or dubious backyard breeders. Puppy mills produce sick puppies that are often born with defects or that develop breed-specific issues later in life. When you buy from a reputable breeder, you will get a health guarantee and know there\u2019s less risk for problems to appear. The Boerboel is predisposed to gastric dilation and volvulus, commonly referred to as bloat. Limiting exercise for an hour after meals can help to lessen the chance of this life threatening problem. Boerboels usually live between 10 and 12 years. The Boerboel requires a considerable amount of exercise to keep him healthy, trim, and happy. Brisk walks throughout the neighborhood will help to keep the dog in shape as well as reinforce his social skills. Although he does need to run, the Boerboel is not the perfect companion for those who like to run for long distances. It is essential that the Boerboel has a large and completely fenced area in which to play. The breed is very active and will be happy to play ball or fetch with his family members for hours. Playtime is a great way to reestablish your role as Alpha with the dog. So, playtime is valuable for these dogs and their owners. Boerboels do well in many competitive activities provided they have been trained well. Obedience and agility trials are favorites of those interested in competing with their Boerboels. Although most do not like people that they do not know, there have been a few Boerboels that have become certified therapy dogs. It\u2019s rare with this breed, but it does happen. The Boerboel can be an obedient and reliable companion, provided he has had proper socialization and training. The Boerboel is a recent addition to the impressive line up of breeds that the American Canine Club recognizes. In 2015, the canine organization added these large South African dogs to their Working Group. When it comes to the qualities of the breed, the AKC says the following about the Boerboel: \u201c The imposing Boerboel is devoted to protecting the people and places he loves. Training and socialization should begin early, before a pup becomes a dominant adult. This is a trainable, versatile breed, eager to spend time with their adored humans. Still, a Boerboel might be way too much dog for the novice owner to handle.\u201d With thick and loose skin and a short, shiny coat, there is no mistake that this breed is a Mastiff style of dog. The skin pigment should be dark in color. Although fawn, red and brown are the most commonly seen colors in the Boerboel, Piebald, brindle and Irish marked is also acceptable within the breed. A black mask is highly desired. A black Boerboel is not permitted to compete in the breed ring because black is considered to be unacceptable. The Boerboel is a large breed, so you can expect their litters to have as many as 7 to 10 puppies. These pooches pop out huge litters and owners of pregnant Boeboels need to be prepared. Needless to say, their babies are fairly large too, especially when compared to other dogs of their age group. These puppies will require a lot of care. Boerboel puppies need timely socialization to cut down on the possibility of developing aggressive behavior. Obedience training from an early age is essential, as it establishes the owner as the Alpha of the pack. Without this, the puppy will grow up to dominate the family. And with a dog of this size- it\u2019s the last thing you want! So make sure to take training your Boerboel puppy quite seriously. It is so important not to waste those early impressional years  with your Boerboel. It will pay off in the long run. Trust us on this.

Small and resembling a tiny Bulldog, a Boston Terrier technically belongs to the non-sporting group as opposed to the Terrier group. Many people find Boston Terriers to be excellent companions and in many cases, well-suited for city and domestic life. Known as the \u201cAmerican Gentleman,\u201d it was formally recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1893. Today, the Boston Terrier is as famous a breed as any and is popular enough to be the pet in a number of families\u2019 homes all across America. But what exactly separates a Boston Terrier from other non-sporting dogs, and is this the kind of dog that you\u2019d ultimately like to see in your own house? To explore these questions, let\u2019s take a look at the history and dimensions that go into making the American Gentleman into what it is today. Many people find Boston Terriers to be excellent companions and in many cases, well-suited for city and domestic life. Unlike many older breeds, the Boston Terrier has a well-recorded history. A man named Robert C. Hooper, of Boston, purchased a dog that came from a Bulldog/Terrier mixture of ancestry. This dog, known as \u201cHooper\u2019s Judge,\u201d eventually had offspring that would breed with French bulldogs, giving rise to a new type of terrier \u2013 one that naturally has the appearance of a bulldog without quite exactly resembling an English Bulldog. At first, this new breed was known as the Bull Terrier, but eventually the name was changed to Boston Terrier. This is thanks to a change in the name of the Bull Terrier Club to the Boston Terrier Club. A new breed was born and it became recognized in 1893. This is the first U.S. breed to be recognized. Today, Boston University\u2019s mascot is a Boston Terrier named Rhett. Although a non-sporting dog by breed, the Boston Terrier owes a lot of its appearance to the French and possibly English Bulldog \u2013 and this is apparent simply when you take a good look at a Boston Terrier. Considered highly intelligent, the Boston Terrier has many of the positive qualities of the Bulldog perhaps without the chip on its shoulder. The Bulldog/Terrier mix that bred to make Hooper\u2019s Judge has come to be known as a terrier in its own right. Boston Terriers are smaller and slimmer than Bulldogs and obviously require a proportionately smaller diet. They can feed on the foods many dogs enjoy such as meat and vegetables. Pet owners should always stay away from processed foods as well as certain foods like chocolate when feeding dogs. As Boston Terriers are not particularly sporty dogs, they might not be as responsive to intensive training as a German Shepherd might be. But Boston Terriers are perfectly capable of being trained as part of a healthy, balanced life within the confines of a family and can certainly stand to be around strangers, which makes them good dogs for apartments and other city dwellings. The Boston Terrier owes a lot of its appearance to the French and possibly English Bulldog. Weighing only around 10 to 25 pounds, a Boston Terrier should not get large at all. It\u2019s easy to over feed Boston Terriers, particularly if you\u2019re not letting them get a sufficient amount of exercise. Although Boston Terriers are small dogs, they are not immune to joint and hip problems, particularly as they have such small legs. Friendly and strong, Boston Terriers can make excellent domestic pets. You might catch an occasional whiff of its more stubborn Bulldog background, but generally Boston Terriers can be a delight to work with and make excellent lapdogs. If you\u2019re an effective trainer, you\u2019ll find the Boston Terrier to be a confident, friendly dog that is eager to please. Since Boston Terriers are better categorized as companion dogs than sporting dogs, they can generally be comfortable around a big group of people and often don\u2019t mind being paired with each other. Boston Terriers typically receive high marks for their ability to interact with children, the elderly, and strangers. Their gentle but outgoing disposition can make them entertaining companions if you\u2019ve never run into a Boston Terrier before. Boston Terriers are susceptible to a number of problems like cataracts, cherry eye, and deafness. Heart murmur is another problem to watch for in Boston Terriers, so be sure that you give your dog regular checkups at your local veterinarian. Like other \u201cshort-snouted\u201d breeds like Shih Tzu and Pugs, Boston Terriers can be susceptible to problems caused by its head and face shape. Less serious problems could include reverse sneeze. Boston Terriers generally enjoy longer lives, often in excess of 15 years. As non-sporting dogs, Boston Terriers do not have a particular need for anything more than daily walks, but it\u2019s never a bad idea to give your Boston Terrier a challenge every once in a while. You want to keep your Boston Terrier at a proper weight, and since they\u2019re so small, it can be easy for them to become sedentary and put on some extra pounds. As long as you feed your Boston Terrier right and give it regular exercise it should maintain a healthy weight. Friendly and strong, Boston Terriers can make excellent domestic pets. The American Kennel Club, which first recognized Boston Terriers in 1893, describes them as: \u201cTruly an \u2018All-American\u2019 dog, the Boston Terrier is a lively and highly intelligent breed with an excellent disposition. Conveying an impression of determination, strength and activity, he is short-headed and compactly built, and must be black, brindle or seal with white markings.\u201d Like Bulldogs, Boston Terriers have short coats that don\u2019t require a lot of maintenance. The coat markings on a Boston Terrier considered a requirement at dog shows. Boston Terrier puppies can be quite tiny and delicate, so it will require a good adjustment before they\u2019ll be properly socialized around children. Typically a Boston Terrier (as well as other small dogs) will spend a good amount of time being raised with its mother and siblings before it\u2019s ready to be accepted into a part of a family.", "facts": " AKC Non-Sporting Families with children, singles, seniors, apartments, houses with/without yards Friendly, lively, entertaining, intelligent", "tags": "apartments, Boston Terrier, cataracts, Cherry Eye, condos, deafness, intelligent, joint problems, reverse sneeze, short snout, Unitied States, "}, "bouvier des flandres": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/bouvier-des-flandres/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bouviers-des-flandres.jpg", "name": "Bouvier des Flandres", "type": "dog", "text": "Always an adventurer, the Bouvier des Flandres has rugged good looks and is generally ready and raring to do almost anything.

Nic de Sottegem, is an ancestor to the majority of the Bouvier de Flandres breed we recognize today.

Centuries old and beloved by the French since the Middle Ages, the Briard is busy, active dog that loves to protect his flock. Originating in France, the Briard has been around since at least the 14th century. In fact, this breed has been depicted in 8th-century tapestries and mentioned in records of the 12th century. This dog was bred to watch over farmer\u2019s flocks and to chase away poachers and wolves. After the French Revolution, this dog was used for keeping sheep within unfenced pastures and guarding property. It\u2019s interesting to note that the only Briards kept by shepherds were the cream of the crop \u2013 they had to be super smart and look sharp. Later on, during World War 1, Briards were used as sentries and on watches because of their acute hearing, and were the official dog of the French army. Because this breed is quite old, it\u2019s difficult to know what its ancestors are. It is known that in the 1800s, the Briard was cross-bred with the Beauceron and the Barbet to standardize its look. The Briard is a highly active, deep-chested dog. This means you not only have to give your dog enough food, but also break up feeding times in order to prevent bloat. You should never free feed a Briard for this reason. Feed multiple smaller daily meals, rather than one larger single feeding. A high-quality dry dog kibble that has meat and fruits included is a smart choice. Stay away from foods that contain a large portion of grain and gluten. The Briard is always up to learn a new trick or task. The Briard is always up to learn a new trick or task. If you\u2019re taking on training, be gentle, as these dogs are known to be sensitive. If you are harsh, he won\u2019t soon forget and will be hesitant with you. Establish your leadership as early as possible, as a Briard will become dominant and take on the pack leader role. Training can go on for longer periods of time \u2013 he loves to work and boasts plenty of versatility, trainability and endurance. The Briard stands 22 to 27 inches tall and can weigh anywhere from 50 to 100 pounds. They can be clowns or be serious, but the one thing in common that all Briards have is they want to please you. Known to have hearts of gold that are wrapped in fur, the Briard makes a perfect family pet for those who like to keep active.

Even though he will be generous with his affection with the family, your Briard may be wary of strangers. You can thank their flock-protecting instinct for that. This makes him an excellent watchdog. To keep him from becoming aggressive with strangers, you should start socialization from an early age and keep up this practice throughout his lifetime.

Farms make an ideal environment for this breed, where he can herd sheep and protect against predators. If you don\u2019t live on a farm, a large, fenced-in yard is necessary. Children will help tire him out, but playtime should always be supervised as he might herd the kids. Because they need a large area in which to move around, apartments and condos are not good living quarters for the Briard. They just won\u2019t get the exercise they need in that small amount of space. They can be clowns or be serious, but the one thing in common that all Briards have is they want to please you. The American Kennel Association says this about the breed: \u201cVigorous and alert, this powerful and agile breed is a native of France.

The Bukovina Sheepdog requires an experienced dog owner with a firm hand in leadership. Training and socialization should begin at a very early age and should be continued throughout the dog\u2019s life. These dogs do respond well to positive reinforcement training but you must maintain a strong position of authority. It is also recommended that you keep your training sessions fairly short as this breed tends to become bored with repetition and may turn stubborn or boisterous in protest. Rather than one long training session each day, break it up into shorter segments. The Bukovina Sheepdog is a giant breed, standing between 25 and 31 inches tall and weighing up to 200 pounds at maturity. Males of the breed are a little larger than females in both height and weight. Males grow 27 to 31 inches tall and weigh up to 200 pounds while females stand 25 to 28 inches tall, weighing 110 to 180 pounds. Though the Bukovina Sheepdog is a giant breed, he is anything but aggressive. These dogs are naturally calm and balanced in terms of temperament which makes them a great choice for families with children. This breed can be very protective, however, so he is likely to be aloof around strangers and may be protective of his perceived territory. The Bukovina Sheepdog has a very loud, penetrating bark that sounds threatening but it is meant to scare off predators and usually isn\u2019t accompanied by any aggressive actions. This dog does require a firm and consistent leader due to his size and independent nature. This breed bonds closely with family and will stop at nothing to protect them. The Bukovina Sheepdog is not known to have any specific health problems, but all dogs are prone to certain illnesses or conditions. Because the Bukovina Sheepdog is such a large dog, he is especially prone to musculoskeletal issues, especially if he grows too quickly or is subjected to rigorous exercise before his bones and joints are finished developing. This breed is also at-risk for bloat, also known as gastric torsion. The average lifespan for the Bukovina Sheepdog is thought to be about 10 to 15 years. As a working breed, the Bukovina Sheepdog has fairly high needs for exercise. In the field, these dogs spend the entire day roaming the mountain side, protecting their flock. As such, they need a long daily walk and would also appreciate having a fenced yard in which to roam. Bukovina Sheepdogs are naturally calm and balanced in terms of temperament. The Bukovina Sheepdog is not currently recognized by the AKC but he is recognized by the FCI in Group 2 as a Mountain Type. As a mountain breed, the Bukovina Sheepdog has a thick coat for protection against harsh weather. This breed has a thick, double coat that is dense and harsh on the outside and soft on the undercoat. The most common coat colors are black and white, often a combination of the two, though solid black and solid white dogs do happen. The average litter size for the Bukovina Sheepdog is 4 to 10 puppies. Because this is a giant breed, it often takes Bukovina Sheepdog puppies more than a year to reach their adult size. It is recommended that you feed puppies a large-breed puppy formula until they reach about 80% of their expected size and then switch to a large- or giant-breed adult formula. Bukovina Sheepdog puppies also need to be started with training and socialization as early as possible.", "facts": " FCI Mountain Type house with a yard, active singles, active families, farm dog, herding loyal, protective, gentle, courageous", "tags": "Bukovina Sheepdog, Carpathian Mountains, gentle giant, herding dog, Romania, Romanian shepherd breed, watchdog, "}, "bull terrier": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/bull-terrier", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/bull-terrier.jpg", "name": "Bull Terrier", "type": "dog", "text": "Whenever you hear the word \u201cBull,\u201d you probably imagine a frightening thing indeed. Who can blame you? Bulls can be scary \u2013 people run away from them as a sport in Pamplona, Spain. Bullfrogs are big, giant versions of frogs that we associate with big, loud noises. But what about the Bull Terrier? Do they live up to the Bull name or are they closer in temperament to that other popular domestic animal, the cat? Well, take one good look at the Bull Terrier and you\u2019ll probably find out why it\u2019s more terrier than bulldog. The rough name can be a little misleading, but as it turns out Bull Terriers can make loyal, energetic, and even fun pets that the entire family can enjoy \u2013 or can work as a great companion even if you\u2019re the only member of your household. But does that mean a Bull Terrier is right for your own domestic situation, whatever it is? Let\u2019s take a closer look at this unique terrier and find out what really makes its clock tick. Bull Terriers can make loyal, energetic, and fun pets that the entire family can enjoy. One look at the Bull Terrier will let you know that the breed really don\u2019t come from such a nasty pedigree of dogs as the name might suggest. Bull Terriers look, well, a little weird. They have larger heads and smooth faces \u2013 a quality often enjoyed by the pet owners in the United Kingdom. In North America, we have to trace their origins to really understand their appeal. Okay, so Bull Terriers do indeed trace some of their lineage to the classic Bulldog breeding, but as it turns out, the dog awakening during the 19th century really changed the direction that Bull Terriers were going. Developed and bred to be anti-rodent machines (for lack of a better term) Bull Terriers broke off from traditional Bulldogs and other similar breeds to establish an identity all their own. In other words, they grew qualities that make them a terrier \u2013 a light and sporty dog \u2013 rather than a Bulldog. And what of this bullish pedigree? It\u2019s not as scary as you might think. Early mixes from the Old English Bulldog, a now-extinct breed, and Manchester Terriers yielded to a genetic influence from English White Terriers (also an extinct breed). With that kind of pedigree, there\u2019s a good case you could make that modern day Bull Terriers are actually torch-carriers for a number of older breeds that don\u2019t exist today. While Bull Terriers don\u2019t have a deep history all their own \u2013 at least in terms of chronological measurement \u2013 its genetics do contain a much larger part of dog history, particularly in England. Bull Terrier is no different than any other dog- this breed requires a well-balanced, quality diet to thrive. The right ratio of meat-based protein, healthy fats, and carbs, as well as an array of vitamins and minerals is the winning combination for canines. As a result, these unique-looking dogs do well on premium quality dry food. Kibble can meet all of their intricate dietary needs as long as the manufacturers use high grade, natural ingredients and not cheap fillers and tons of artificial substances to improve the flavor. Once you settle on a dry food brand that lives up to this standard, make sure to pick out a formula that will suit a Bull Terrier dog. As a rule of thumb, these playful dogs do well on kibble made for active or medium size dogs. Additionally, their kibble should be age appropriate. Puppies, adults, and seniors will have specific and different nutritional needs. For instance, Bull Terrier puppies need food that\u2019s fortified with a lot of calcium, as they go through rapid growth and bone development in their young years.  Bull Terriers again go against the grain of what their name suggests with their temperament \u2013 they\u2019re much more light-natured than the stubborn Bulldogs can be. They\u2019re often described as fun and energetic and their behavior will probably bear a resemblance to a number of other terriers. If you\u2019ve worked with terriers before, the behavior of the Bull Terrier won\u2019t be a major challenge for you. How does this apply to the world of Bull Terrier training? Well, they\u2019re highly responsive and love a good, active workout. They\u2019re often described as fun and energetic. A male Bull Terrier can see a big weight range, so don\u2019t be concerned if you think your Bull Terrier is a little too small or big. Typically they can weigh in the 40-80 pound range for males, though obviously finding some sort of happy medium will be best for these dogs. Bull Terriers behave like classic terriers and aren\u2019t a major challenge to handle if you\u2019ve worked with terriers before. They can be independent and energetic, which means they like to play by themselves often when they\u2019re let out in the open. This means you\u2019ll want to keep good track of your Bull Terrier in social situations, particularly as it\u2019s growing up. Many dogs have certain propensities toward health problems, and Bull Terriers are no different, showing an inclination toward skin conditions and allergies. Another relatively common issue for the egg-shaped breed is deafness, and on rare occasions, risk for heart disease and kidney failure. Additionally, like most dogs of their size, they can be at risk for kneecap dislocation (patellar luxation). Bull Terriers have a long and healthy life expectancy, sometimes living up to 16 years. So if you do find a Bull Terrier for your family expect to develop a long-term bond with it. Also remember that Bull Terriers really do represent long-term commitments as any dog would, but in the case of Bull Terriers this commitment can be even more pronounced. Like many terriers, Bull Terriers are also full of energy, curious and exceptionally intelligent. These feisty dogs need daily exercise to stay happy and healthy. However, even though their energy levels are high, they are still considered to be a moderately demanding breed. Their needs for activity can be met with a couple of long walks and some quality playtime each day. A rough estimate is that about 60 minutes of deliberate exercise is what this breed needs to thrive. In addition to physical exercise, Bull Terriers need to have their brain stimulated, too. These are smart, driven, curious dogs that easily get bored. As a result, they will become destructive and show their frustration by ruining your furniture or a favorite pair of shoes. To prevent that, make sure you provide engaging mental activity, as well. Offer puzzle toys for entertainment and mental stimulation, especially while you\u2019re at work. Bull Terriers have a high tolerance for very active exercise. Dog breed experts describe Bull Terriers as playful and clownish. The American Kennel Club describes the breed as\u201d Among the most comical and mischievous citizens of dogdom, the Bull Terrier is playful and endearing, sometimes stubborn, but always devoted. These unique \u201ceggheads\u201d are exuberant, muscular companions who thrive on affection and exercise.\u201d Hardly the \u201cBull\u201d type, wouldn\u2019t you say? Bull Terriers come with a short coat that has a minimal need for upkeep. Focus more on exercise \u2013 the Bull Terriers will need that much more than attention to their coat. Bull Terrier puppies usually come in litters of five. Raising Bull Terrier puppies is not difficult if you have previous experience with training and socialization. Start working with your pet on time and you\u2019ll help them mature into a loving, friendly, and goofy dog they can be. If you fail to assert yourself as the leader of the pack and skip on essential obedience training and socialization, your Bull Terrier will grow up to be more bull-headed than well-behaved. Another essential part of care for Bull Terrier puppies is to provide them calcium-rich food that would support their fast growth and developing skeleton.", "facts": " AKC Non-Sporting Families with children, active singles and seniors, apartments, houses with/without yards Independent, energetic, affectionate", "tags": "allergies, apartments, Bull Terrier, condos, England, skin conditions, "}, "bulldog": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/bulldog", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/bulldog.jpg", "name": "Bulldog", "type": "dog", "text": "If there\u2019s a better breed of dog that serves as a better name for football teams, we\u2019d like to hear it. The Bulldog \u2013 also sometimes known as the English or British Bulldog \u2013 is an instantly recognizable breed that resembles a large Pug. Its large head and short legs can make for a cute playmate. While many people associate the word \u201cbulldog\u201d with fierce fighters, actual Bulldogs can be quite friendly, despite a reputation for stubbornness. Bulldogs will also appear in a number of colors, from light brown and white to black and white. Many Bullys, as they are called, are famous for a \u201csourpuss\u201d expression on their faces, but if you can look past its looks and into its personality, you\u2019ll find a worthwhile pet and even better friend. Although they don\u2019t quite make for a great lapdog, they can be a fun dog to take for walks and to play with when they\u2019re in a particularly giddy mood. As the name of English or British Bulldog suggests, Bulldogs are from England. Around 1500 AD, you\u2019ll find the earliest known mentions of this dog, although the old spelling labelled them as Bolddogges or Bondogges. In the 1600s, the first appearances of the modern spelling of Bulldog first took place, suggesting that these dogs were around in their relatively modern form for quite some time. Bullys could be used for brutal purposes early on, including bull bating and dog fighting, and as a consequence the modern bulldog generally has a fearlessness about it. After dog fighting was banned in Britain, the Bulldog became more prevalent in the Americas until a resurgence of breeding in Britain led to the modern-day breed that we\u2019re familiar with today. Modern Bullys are typically tamer than were its in-fighting ancestors. Bulldogs can be quite friendly, despite a reputation for stubbornness. Although Bullys have been around quite some time, their ancestry is a bit disputed. Some people believe that Bulldogs come from a three-dog mix that included Pugs and Spanish dogs. Bulldogs typically enjoy a normal diet for dogs of their size and will enjoy a treat like bacon or sausage or even cheap meats that you might have readily available. Since Bulldogs are not great exercisers, it\u2019s important not to over feed them. Bulldogs are highly responsive to training, which is part of the reason they were made into dog fighters and bull baiters centuries ago. Training this breed does not require a lot of wrestling or excessive dog handling, and in fact sometimes well-trained Bullys might be used to assist other dogs in training. The Bulldog makes a worthwhile pet and even better friend. Weighing roughly 40-50 pounds depending on height and gender, Bulldogs are a classic example of a relatively mid-sized dog. The large head and torso of the Bully contrasts with the smaller legs and this can lead to some health problems later on in a Bulldog\u2019s life. Bulldogs can be presented as having complex personalities, perhaps a sign of their somewhat tainted past. Since Bullys were used for some brutal activities like dog fighting and bull baiting (a process in which Bulldogs would be matched up against bulls), it might be argued that Bulldogs have had the fear \u201cbred\u201d out of them. This has given rise to using the Bulldog as a mascot, particularly in the United States, where Fresno State University in California and the University of Georgia both use the breed as their mascot. With today\u2019s Bully, a stubborn but sometimes playful and often friendly temperament can be expected. Bulldogs are also known for having a unique, battle-ready posture (which partially explains their usefulness as mascots) that gives the Bulldogs a good deal of poise around both people and other dogs. Bulldogs have the ideal dog personality, according to Bully lovers, and are classic examples of dogs that might be considered good for city living: they\u2019re easy to get along with, low-maintenance, and their coat is not difficult to maintain. Being friendly dogs, this breed usually sound meaner than they really are.\n\n The leading cause of death in Bulldogs is cardiac-related, but cancer and old age are also common causes. Hip dysplasia, very common in larger dogs, is most common in this breed, which means you won\u2019t want to over exercise your Bulldog through the years if you don\u2019t want to give them joint damage. Because of the makeup of the Bulldog \u2013 with its high amount of upper-body weight as opposed to lower-body \u2013 joint problems can always be an issue, particularly in a Bulldog\u2019s old age. Bulldogs can also be afflicted with \u201cCherry Eye,\u201d although this condition can be fixed by a veterinarian. It\u2019s also important to remember that Bulldogs can be very sensitive to heat and should be kept in the shade and given plenty of water during summer months. Different studies put the lifespan of the Bulldog anywhere from 6-12 years. Many estimates suggest that Bulldogs will live around 10-12 years. Bulldogs are a low-exercise dog. This is not to say that they should do without it completely, but generally getting your Bulldog moving on a regular basis is all you\u2019ll really need to consider. Unlike other dogs that need to be worn out, a Bully is perfectly comfortable lazing with you on a Sunday afternoon. If you are physically incapacitated and wonder about walking a dog, a Bulldog might be a good choice of breed for you. With today\u2019s Bulldogs, a stubborn but sometimes playful and often friendly temperament can be expected. The American Kennel Club describes Bulldogs as: \u201cknown for their loose-jointed, shuffling gait and massive, short-faced head, the Bulldog is known to be equable, resolute and dignified.\u201d A low-maintenance coat is another reason Bulldogs can be considered a low-maintenance dog. Its coat is usually short and doesn\u2019t vary wildly in color.

As a large-breed dog, the Can de Palleiro should be fed a high-quality dry food formulated for large breeds. This is a working breed, so he may respond well to an active or working breed formula. You still need to be careful about overfeeding, however, to prevent obesity. The Can de Palleiro is a strong and independent breed, though not inherently stubborn or strong-willed.

The Can de Palleiro is a large dog, standing 22 to 26 inches tall and weighing anywhere from 55 to 84 pounds at maturity. Males of the breed tend to be larger than females. The Can de Palleiro\u2019s primary characteristic is his protective instincts. This breed was developed to guard livestock and farm property, so he has an innate strength and independence but is still gentle and calm. The Can de Palleiro is reserved, particularly around strangers, and he takes a little while to warm up to new people. This breed is fiercely devoted to his master and to other people in his family \u2013 he can even be sweet and calm around children. If you plan to keep this dog with children or other household pets, however, early socialization and training is recommended. Because the Can de Palleiro is so rare, little is known about the breed\u2019s health problems. As an ancient breed, it can be assumed that the breed is relatively unbothered by genetic health problems, though there may be other issues that come into play. Large dogs such as this one tend to have trouble with bloat, hip dysplasia, and other musculoskeletal issues. The average lifespan for the Can de Palleiro is unknown because it is so rare. However, due to its size, it likely has a lifespan between 10 and 14 years. The Can de Palleiro has excellent stamina as a working breed, but he is generally not an overactive dog.

The Can de Palleiro has a thick double coat like most shepherds, designed to protect the dog from the elements. This breed\u2019s coat stands out from the skin and is slightly coarse to the touch. It is generally off-white to light tan in color with slightly longer fur around the collar and on the underside of the tail. Daily brushing is recommended to control shedding, though this breed only requires occasionally bathing. The average litter size of the Can de Palleiro is unknown because there is such a limited number of these dogs left. As a shepherd breed, this dog can be a little aloof and independent, so if you plan to keep one as a pet you should start with socialization and training as early as possible. Also, because this breed grows fairly large, you should feed puppies a large-breed puppy formula until they reach about 80% of their adult size then switch to a large-breed adult recipe.

The breed gets its name from the region of Canaan, which today encompasses Israel and Palestine, and started off as a free-roaming feral breed. Canaans belong to the Spitz family and have the characteristic appearance of most primitive dog breeds. Their medium-sized bodies are sinewy and lean and their wedge-shaped heads are topped off with medium-sized pointy ears. The Canaan\u2019s tail is high set and is often carried over their backs when excited. Their legs are long and lean and their feet are protected by hard pads. The Canaan is described as a highly intelligent breed that has a strong personality. Like most other primitive breeds, they can sometimes be a handful to handle and require firm and consistent leadership. They are however extremely devoted to their masters and make excellent companions for experienced dog owners. The Canaan Dog (pronounced kay-nen) is one of the oldest known breeds of dog in existence today. The story of the Canaan Dog has its roots in ancient Israel. Archeologists have discovered 4000 year-old tomb paintings that depict dogs similar in appearance to the Canaan. The bible too makes references to various free-roaming dog packs that humans used as working dogs. These pieces of evidence suggest that the Canaan Dog could very well be the \u201cmissing link\u201d between wolves and modern domesticated dogs. The wild ancestors of the modern day Canaan Dog were first captured and bred in captivity by one Dr. Rudolphina Menzel around the early 1930\u2019s. Dr. Menzel began her breeding program by luring in semi-free and free roaming Canaans and capturing litters of puppies. Menzel found that these highly intelligent dogs were extremely adaptable and easy to domesticate. In fact, an adult specimen that Dr. Menzel named \u201cDugma\u201d took six months to capture and a few weeks to domesticate. Dr. Menzel\u2019s breeding program initially provided Canaans as working dogs and mine-sweepers for the Israeli military, making them the first breed of dog to be used for this purpose. Later on, Dr. Menzel\u2019s puppies were made available to civilians as pets and guard dogs. Before her death in 1973, Dr. Menzel provided Shaar Hagai Kennels with their first breeding stock and the breed is safeguarded and developed to this day by the kennel. Canaan Dogs are actually one of the few breeds of dog that are untouched by humans; meaning that the breed has been unchanged by human influence since ancient times. It originated as a free-roaming feral breed in ancient Israel. Canaans should be fed on 1.5 to 2 cups of high quality dog food divided into two meals each day. Canaans are a highly intelligent breed of dog and are capable of making decisions for themselves. Canaans are a highly intelligent breed of dog and are capable of making decisions for themselves; which isn\u2019t a great surprise considering that they have survived as free-roamers for thousands of years. Their intelligence makes them highly trainable, but their strong will and tendency to get bored quickly calls for owners that are capable of providing firm and consistent leadership as well as engaging training methods. Canaans are often excellent at dog agility trials as well as obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking and herding events. Fully grown Canaan males can weigh anywhere between 35-55 pounds. Canaans are extremely devoted and protective of their families. They are naturally mistrustful of strangers and are quick to announce any unknown arrivals into their territory. They are brave but not overly aggressive. These qualities make the Canaan an excellent guard dog. However, it is important that Canaan owners let their dogs know that they are in charge and the leader of the \u201cpack\u201d. A failure to do so can often lead to problems with overly aggressive behavior. Canaans are a very social breed of dog and do best when housed with a large family and other dogs. They love children and have a natural protective instinct towards them. They can however be mistrusting of strange children and can be wary of strange children. For these reasons it is very important to socialize Canaans from a very early age with other humans and animals. Like most breeds \u201cuntouched\u201d by humans, Canaans are a very healthy breed of dog. Canaan Dogs enjoy a relatively high life expectancy of 12-15 years. Canaans are a highly energetic breed and owners should provide their dogs with enough exercise to drain these energy levels each day. When denied an outlet to release their pent up energy, Canaans can become restless and develop various behavioral issues. Canaans are extremely devoted and protective of their families. The Canaan Dog was recognized by the American Kennel Club in June, 1997. The club has this to say about the breed: \u201cInquisitive, loyal and loving with his family, the Canaan Dog is a breed that moves with athletic agility. Today, he is successful in the herding, obedience, agility and conformation arenas. This breed has two color patterns: either predominantly white with a mask, with or without additional patches of color, or solid colored with or without white trim.\u201d The Canaan Dog has a double coat consisting of a harsh, straight outer coat and a thick, soft undercoat. They do not require any special care in terms of grooming and need only be brushed and combed once a week. The Canaan is a heavy seasonal shedder and has no doggy odor. Unlike most other breeds of dogs that mature at 12 months, Canaans take nearly 3 years to reach adulthood. However, their protective and territorial instincts often kick in at 2 years of age and they should therefore be trained and socialized from puppyhood.", "facts": " AKC Herding Group Families with children, houses with yards, farms and rural areas Alert, quick, intelligent, devoted", "tags": "agility trials, Canaan Dog, flyball, herding, intelligent, Israel, primitive breed, "}, "canadian eskimo dog": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/canadian-eskimo-dog/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Canadian-Eskimo-Dog-668x477.jpg", "name": "Canadian Eskimo Dog", "type": "dog", "text": "Like many sled dog breeds, the Canadian Eskimo Dog has a powerful build and a thick coat.

Like many sled dog breeds, the Canadian Eskimo Dog has a powerful build and a thick coat. The origins of the Canadian Eskimo Dog can be traced back more than 4,000 years to the Inuit people. This breed was developed for pulling sleds and for hunting. The early Inuits never considered the Canadian Eskimo Dog a pet, or even part of the animal kingdom \u2013 it was merely a tool to be used. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the breed\u2019s numbers had declined severely but the dogs were still in demand for use in polar expeditions. By the 1960s, the breed\u2019s numbers had declined so severely that it was removed from both UKC and AKC registries. In 1970 Brian Ladoon started the Eskimo Dog Research Fund in an attempt to increase the breed\u2019s numbers. The Canadian Eskimo Dog was bred by the Thule people and has existed in the Arctic region for at least 4,000 years. Some believe the breed is related to (or even the same breed as) the Greenland Dog. This breed is known by several other names including Inuit Husky, Qimmiq, and Gronlandshund. Given that the Canadian Eskimo Dog is a fairly large and naturally active breed, you should consider providing him with a dog food formulated for active dogs, particularly one with a high protein content. You should also make sure that the food is formulated to meet the needs of large-breed dogs. If your dog does not receive daily exercise, be very careful not to overfeed him or he may become obese. These dogs are being kept more often as companion animals and they have the capacity to be gentle and loyal with family. These dogs are intelligent and trainable. Unlike many spitz-type breeds, they also tend to be fairly submissive \u2013 they crave the presence of an authority figure. For this reason, it is recommended that you start training early and maintain a firm and consistent hand in training throughout the dog\u2019s life. The Canadian Eskimo Dog is a fairly large breed, though size varies considerably between the sexes. Male Canadian Eskimo Dogs measure up to 37 inches high and weigh between 65 and 105 lbs. at maturity, while females measure up to 24 inches high and weigh between 60 and 95 lbs. The Canadian Eskimo Dog was originally bred to work, so their temperament was thought of with any great importance. Today, however, these dogs are being kept more often as companion animals and they have the capacity to be gentle and loyal with family. Canadian Eskimo Dogs develop deep, intense bonds with their owner and they can be a fairly vocal. This breed is well suited for outdoor living and they have a higher prey drive than many similar breeds so they should be supervised around cats and other household pets. The Canadian Eskimo Dog is generally a healthy breed not troubled by the consequences of inbreeding due to a large foundation stock. Like all breeds, however, the breed is prone to several minor health issues including hip dysplasia, gastric torsion, entropion, cataracts, heat intolerance, and arthritis. The average lifespan of the Canadian Eskimo Dog is generally between 10 and 15 years. A healthy diet and regular exercise can help preserve the longevity of this breed. The Canadian Eskimo Dog has high needs for daily exercise because they are a working breed. A simple daily walk will not be adequate for these dogs \u2013 they need to run or be given a job to perform. Training the breed for various dog sports such as agility, carting, mushing, or skijoring is recommended to provide them with an adequate outlet for their energy. Canadian Eskimo Dogs tend to be fairly submissive \u2013 they crave the presence of an authority figure. The Canadian Eskimo Dog was once recognized by both the UKC and the AKC prior to the 1960s. In 1959, both the AKC and the UKC dropped the Canadian Eskimo Dog from registries citing low numbers. The breed has yet to recover and be accepted by either agency. The Canadian Eskimo Dog has a thick, medium-length double coat. The undercoat is dense and soft while the outer coat is long and harsh to protect the dog from cold and harsh weather. The length of the outer coat varies between 3 and 6 inches and, particularly in males, it may form a long mane over the shoulders and around the neck. This breed tends to molt once a year in early fall, though brushing is recommended throughout the year to control shedding. Historically, the Inuit people would train Canadian Eskimo Dogs for the harness as soon as they were old enough to walk \u2013 the puppy\u2019s attempt to break free from the harness would teach him the habit of pulling a sledge. By the age of 8 weeks, puppies would be paired with adult dogs and educated in the art of sled pulling.", "facts": " Not applicable Families with children, active singles, houses with yards Affectionate, hard-working, gentle, brave", "tags": "Canadian Eskimo Dog, "}, "cane corso": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/cane-corso/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cane-corso1.jpg", "name": "Cane Corso", "type": "dog", "text": "Noble and brave, the Cane Corso is strong in mind, body and conviction.

Cane Corsos are strong enough to take down the fiercest animals and are also willing to take out strangers, if not properly socialized, so it goes without saying that training and socialization are a must. This dog is a fanatic when it comes to patrolling his home to protect his family from intruders, making him an incredible watchdog and guard dog. With an owner who is assertive and won\u2019t let the dog take over as leader of the family, the Cane Corso makes a wonderful family companion. He is tolerant of kids in his family and will do all that he can to protect them from harm. Loyal to a fault, Cane Corso is best described as a canine bodyguard- but his traits and personality make him much more than a personal protector. To learn more about the Cane Corso, read on. Nobel and brave, the Cane Corso is strong in mind, body and conviction. While physical proof is hard to come by, it is believed by experts that the Cane Corso is a direct descendant of the old Roman Molossian dogs, also known as the Canis Pugnax, not unlike other breeds categorized as Molossers (this group includes Mastiffs, Great Dane, the Great Pyryneese, Rottweiler and many others). The name of the breed roughly translates to \u201cbodyguard dog\u201d and having in mind the character and the appearance of the Cane Corso, it\u2019s easy to see how the breed got its name. However, even though it is believed that the breed hails back to Roman wars, as time passed the breed evolved: Cane Corso were not war dogs anymore- they were bred to herd cattle or protect the farm from large beasts such as wild bulls or wild hogs.  While, initially, Cane Corso could be found all over Italy, the two world wars and the collapse of the farming system they were evolved to function within led to a sharp fall in numbers. The majority of the very few Cane Corso remaining in the 1960s could be mostly found in the southern parts of the country in the region Puglia but thanks to the efforts of enthusiasts, these dogs can now be found all over the world.  With a history dating all the way to the Roman Empire, Cane Corso has a long tradition as a breed but things haven\u2019t always been great for these noble dogs. For years, many people thought this breed had become extinct however; in the 1980s, Cane Corso enthusiasts worked diligently to ensure this breed would survive and they managed to preserve these unique dogs through responsible and selective breeding. The Cane Corso was recognized by the American Kennel Society in 2010, and it is also recognized as a breed with a distinct set of standards by other major canine societies such as FCI or the United Kennel Club. Needless to say, big dogs need a lot of food- and it has to be high quality, nutritious chow that will support their immune system and give them enough fuel for daily activities.The Cane Corso requires a significant amount of high-quality, dry dog food. Some people opt for feeding BARF or home cooked meals instead, but if you go down that route, please be sure to consult with a veterinarian. It\u2019s easy to leave out some crucial nutrients when you prepare your pet\u2019s food, especially on a scale that a huge dog such as the Cane Corso requires.

This breed likes to be the dominant one in the home so he must learn his place at an early age or he will exert his dominance over the entire family. It\u2019s best for this breed to be involved in some sort of formal training all through his life. After all, he was bred to be a working dog and so long as he has jobs to do, he will be a productive member of the family. Cane Corsos do very well in obedience trials. Their natural work ethic and high intelligence make him a wonderful prospect for this type of competition. Several police agencies have found this breed to be valuable partners.

This breed is also highly susceptible to gastric torsion. The average lifespan of the Cane Corso is somewhere between 10 and 12 years. Cane Corsos need a lot of exercise to keep them healthy and content. This breed is happy to go jogging through the neighborhood or hiking in the mountains. Active and full of energy, the Cane Corso also enjoys romping around the yard chasing down tennis balls. Of course, a securely fenced yard is essential for those owning this breed. Without enough exercise, the Cane Corso will become bored. Boredom leads to destructive behavior.

Cane Corsos may have a black or gray mask to contrast with coats of black, fawn, red or gray. The Cane Corso requires little grooming. A weekly brushing will remove any loose coat however; while shedding, a shedding blade will quickly remove the heavy tufts. Bathing should only be done when needed. Cane Corso puppies can be quite a handful! They require constant socialization from the moment they get to their new homes.

There are, however, certain health problems that might be a problem simply based on the dog\u2019s size. Some of the health problems that might affect this breed include hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, gastric torsion, entropion, ectropion, cataracts, and progressive retinal atrophy. The average lifespan for the Cao de Castro Laboreiro is thought to be about 12 to 15 years. As a livestock guarding breed, the Cao de Castro Laboreiro spends a lot of time on the move so his energy level is fairly high. A 60-minute walk once a day will generally be enough to meet this breed\u2019s exercise requirements, though you can break it into two smaller sessions. This breed will also appreciate having a fenced yard to himself. Cao de Castro Laboreiro forms strong bonds with family and can be protective and territorial at times. The Cao de Castro Laboreiro is not currently recognized by the AKC but he is recognized by the FCI and the UKC. The FCI classifies him in Group 2 as a Mountain Type and the UKC as a Guardian Dog. The Cao de Castro Laboreiro is a large dog with a short but very thick weather-resistant coat. It is shorter and smoother on the head, ears, and legs but longer on the thighs and tail. The breed does not have an undercoat, but it does shed fairly heavily. Although the Cao de Castro Laboreiro\u2019s coat is very thick, his grooming requirements are fairly low. Brushing the dog\u2019s coat several times a week will help keep shedding under control and will distribute the natural oils produced in his skin to keep the coat water resistant. This breed should never require professional grooming unless you prefer not to do things like nail clipping and ear cleaning yourself. The average litter size for the Cao de Castro Laboreiro is 4 to 8 puppies. Because this breed grows up to 90 pounds at maturity, it often takes puppies more than a year to reach their full size. During this time, it is best to feed your puppy a large-breed puppy formula to prevent him from growing too quickly. It is also very important with this breed to start training and socialization as early as possible.", "facts": " UKC Guardian Dog house with a yard, active singles, active families, outdoors loyal, protective, affectionate, stubborn", "tags": "Cao de Castro Laboreiro, general livestock guarding, guard dog, Portugal, "}, "caravan hound": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/caravan-hound/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/caravan-hound-668x474.jpg", "name": "Caravan Hound", "type": "dog", "text": "The Caravan Hound is known by several names in its homeland. Though you may not recognize any of those names, you may recognize the breed by his size and build. The Caravan Hound is a medium-sized breed with a long, lithe body similar to that of the Greyhound. The Caravan Hound is a type of sighthound traditionally used for hunting and guarding but, more recently, for surveillance and border protection by the Indian Army. Commonly kept as a pet among villagers living in India\u2019s Deccan Plateau, the Caravan Hound is a sighthound typically used for hunting and guarding. The breed was introduced in western India from Arabia and Central Asia and is therefore considered a direct descendant of Asian and Arabian sighthounds such as the Saluki or Tazi. Because the breed is popular in the Mudhol Taluk of Karnataka, it is also sometimes called the Mudhol Hound. The feathered variety of the breed has its own name \u2013 Pashmi or Karwani. The Caravan Hound is though to be a direct descendant of the Saluki, also known as the Persian Greyhound or Tazi. The Caravan Hound is a large breed, according to its adult size, so it may do well on a large-breed dog food. Keep in mind, however, that these formulas tend to be lower in fat than traditional adult dog diets, so this type of recipe may not meet your dog\u2019s high energy needs. You may be better off with an active or working breed formula, especially if you plan to train your dog for hunting. The Caravan Hound is an intelligent and very trainable breed, though he tends to fare best with an experienced dog owner. These dogs have the stamina and strength to work for hours in even extreme conditions, so they can be strong willed when they need to be. This can sometimes be a challenge and you should expect your dog to have a will of his own at times. When treated fairly, however, this breed can be quite loyal and protective of his family and his territory. The Caravan Hound technically qualifies as a large-breed dog because it typically weighs more than 50 pounds at maturity. Even so, he remains at the lower end of the spectrum with an average weight between 48 and 62 pounds. Males are a little larger than females, standing 26 to 29 inches tall while females are usually 23 to 26 inches tall. The Caravan Hound is generally a quiet and peaceful dog that can do quite well in a family setting with proper training and socialization. Though it may be adaptable to apartment or condo living with adequate exercise, it is better suited to a house with a fenced yard and a family who will give him plenty of exercise. These dogs can become quite loyal with family, though they are always likely to be wary around strangers \u2013 they do not like to be touched by unfamiliar people, a trait which makes them do well as a watchdog. These dogs are also at-risk for becoming nervous or aggressive if they aren\u2019t treated gently and with respect. The Caravan Hound is generally regarded as a hardy breed, not prone to any inherited health problems. Based on his size and breeding, however, he may be prone to certain issues such as hip dysplasia, bloat, eye problems, and ear infections. The average lifespan for the Caravan Hound is 10 to 15 years. As a hunting breed, the Caravan Hound has very high needs for exercise. This breed is capable of performing under even the most grueling conditions, so it has a great deal of strength and stamina. These dogs need a bare minimum of an hour of vigorous exercise per day and a fenced yard is preferred so they can get some additional exercise. The Caravan Hound is not currently recognized by the AKC but it is by the Kennel Club of India (KCI) and the Indian National Kennel Club (INKC). The KCI registers the breed as the Caravan Hound and the INKC as the Mudhol Hound. The Caravan Hound has a distinct Greyhound-like appearance with long limbs, a slim build, and a lithe, athletic appearance. The coat is very short and smooth, though there is also a variety that exhibits silky feathering on the ears, legs, and tail. Dogs with a feathered coat are known as Pashmi or Karwani. Acceptable colors for the Caravan Hound breed include fawn, red, cream, black, and mouse gray or any of these colors broken with a small amount of white. The average litter size for the Caravan Hound is 3 to 7 puppies. Currently, there are about 750 families in the Mudhol town of Karnataka that are actively breeding the Caravan Hound. Because this breed is used for hunting, early socialization and training is recommended.

Even though leadership skills are required of virtually any type of dog, you\u2019ll soon realize that you have to be up to this \u201cchallenge\u201d if you want a Cardigan Welsh Corgi. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi can be a perfectly friendly, ready-to-please breed that is nice to children as long as it understands its place in the pecking order. Considering how common this is across a variety of dog breeds, there might be something else about the Cardigan Welsh Corgi that attracts you to the breed. Maybe it\u2019s the small, house-ready features or simply its lively, often-submissive personality. Whatever it is about the Cardigan Welsh Corgi that attracts you to this breed, it\u2019s time to fill in the blanks and learn even more about what makes it unique.  The Cardigan Welsh Corgi can be a perfectly friendly, ready-to-please breed. Many believe that the Cardigan Welsh Corgi first arrived at Cardiganshire in 1,200 B.C. If so, this makes the breed among the oldest known breeds. Like many dogs, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi built up its instincts by being of a certain use to farmers\u2026 in this case, British farmers who would need a way to herd cattle without taking up a lot of space. Herding remains a strong instinct in the Cardigan to this day, and we\u2019ll get into a little bit more detail later to explain how this behavior can manifest itself in the 21st century. Being suited for the outdoors but able to handle smaller spaces, thanks to this upbringing, the origins of the Cardigan Welsh Corgi have led to it becoming a flexible outdoor/indoor dog, capable of handling city life or rural life. As the Cardigan Welsh Corgi breed grew and was eventually recognized as its own breed in the 1930s, it attained this flexibility by living in many small-acre farms and lots. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi has a long and extensive history, and may have descended initially from breeds like the Schipperke and the Swedish Vallhund. We can\u2019t talk about the lineage of the Cardigan Welsh Corgi without addressing the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, a breed that is closely related to the Cardigan Welsh Corgi but is believed to have descended from them rather than ascending to them. These dogs were so similar they were believed to be the same breed for a long time, but official recognition in 1934 had them as recognized as being separate breeds. A usual dog diet of meat and whole ingredients will work just fine on the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, with special attention being placed onto the manner in which the food is being served. A Cardigan Welsh Corgi should not believe it is at the top of the pecking order, and you should only feed it when it is calm and not manipulating you into getting food. These dogs are generally obedient so long as you lay down the fundamentals. Training for the Cardigan Welsh Corgi can be both a pleasure but also a test of your leadership. These dogs are generally obedient so long as you lay the fundamentals down \u2013 that is to say, you establish that you are the leader of your household and that your dog\u2019s place is below that of any humans who reside in it. The dog should be able to pick up on this, and when it does, it can make a highly trainable and obedient companion. Both males and females will probably weigh in the 25-30 pound range; keep in mind that a small weight fluctuation in a Cardigan Welsh Corgi can still represent a large percentage of its overall mass compared to humans. This is a breed that gains weight easily. This dog is very amicable once it understands its place in your household, but like all smaller dogs it can become rambunctious and seek dominance in the absence of leadership. Your dog will be able to understand from its stature that you are a leader\u2026 but only if you act like one. Overall, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi can be energetic, obedient, eager-to-please, lively, and often shy of strangers, which you\u2019ll want to work on. Problems with the back \u2013 thanks to its body structure \u2013 and glaucoma run especially rampant in this breed. A healthy Cardigan Welsh Corgi should live from around 12-15 years, typical for dogs of its size. If you don\u2019t like getting a lot of exercise, this probably isn\u2019t the breed for you, as the Cardigan Welsh Corgi needs daily exercise that is fairly rigorous, and is capable of handling plenty of exercise on a habitual basis. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi can be energetic, obedient, eager-to-please, lively, and often shy of strangers. The American Kennel Club says: \u201cThe Cardigan can adapt to country life or city apartments, but need some form of daily exercise. As a companion dog, they love to be with their people and are loyal, affectionate and even-tempered.\u201d The coat of the Cardigan Welsh Corgi is medium-length and generally water-resistant, meaning this dog can handle rainy and snowy environments. The coat requires just minimal grooming, and is typically colored with colors like black, brown, red, and even blue. Good socialization is very important in these dogs, and most proper socialization happens from the puppy years on up. If you can make sure your Cardigan Welsh Corgi puppy understands that strangers are not a threat and make an effort to socialize them properly, it will likely grow with a normal, healthy understanding of human life and even come to embrace it.

And no wonder- there still are feral dogs of this breed all across the Southeastern United States. Carolina Dogs are descended from the \u201cpariah dogs\u201d which were brought to North America more than 9,000 years ago. These dogs are one of the few breeds that still exist which can be classified as a \u201cprimitive\u201d breed, largely unaffected by man or selective breeding. In the parts of the country where these dogs are commonly found, the breed is also known as a yellow dog, yaller dog, American Dingo, or Dixie Dingo. However, even though these dogs still retain much of their wild nature, they are gentle and devoted companions. With proper training and socialization the Carolina Dog can make a wonderful family pet. These rare canines are loyal to a fault, energetic, and independent and will thrive with an active, outdoorsy owner by their side. They also fare well as watchdogs, as they are usually wary of strangers and will promptly alert their owners of any intrusion. Carolina Dogs are descended from the \u201cpariah dogs\u201d which were brought to North America more than 9,000 years ago. It is only within the last 40 years that written records of the Carolina Dog have come into existence. This breed was first discovered by Dr. I. Lehr Brisbin Jr. at the University of Georgia\u2019s Savannah River Ecology Site. Though the exact origins of the breed are up for debate, most experts agree that the Carolina Dog\u2019s ancestors were the \u201cpariah dogs\u201d which originate in Asia. These dogs accompanied their Asian companions across the Bering Strait somewhere between 7,000 and 20,000 years ago where they came to inhabit the American South. Over many decades, these dogs became highly adapted to their environment and while many were domesticated, wild specimens of the breed are still in existence. The Carolina Dog is a primitive breed, thought to be a direct descendant of the so-called \u201cpariah dogs\u201d which came with Asian immigrants across the Bering Strait over 9,000 years ago. These dogs were thought to be the first domesticated breed in the Americas and wild specimens still exist. Their numbers, both in the feral communities and with those who became pets and companions, are still very modest. However, owing to their many qualities, this breed has many enthusiasts keen on elevating it to an AKC recognized status. In 2017, Carolina Dog was accepted by the AKC as a Foundation Stock Service Breed. \n\nCurrently, there is a handful of breeders who are working towards setting a standard for the Carolina Dog, which would lead the breed to recognition. While there are no pedigrees for puppies of this breed currently, those with known or approved parentage will begin being listed with AKC\u2019s registry. The \u201cAmerican Dingo\u201d might seem like he needs a meal plan based on the diet of wild dogs, but that\u2019s far from the truth. Carolina Dogs are no different than other breeds in terms of their needs, so a diet based on high-quality dry food will suit them well.  The Carolina Dog is a medium-sized breed and should be fed a dog food diet formulated for dogs of its size. It is also, however, a fairly active breed and would do well with a dog food formulated for active dogs to ensure that his energy needs are met. Additionally, the age of your pe should be taken into consideration, as well- puppies, adult dogs, and seniors all have different nutritive needs. These dogs are highly intelligent and independent, they also have a well-developed hunting instinct. Because the Carolina Dog is a primitive breed, it still retains much of its wild nature.

Because these dogs are intelligent, and because they are clean by nature, they are usually easy to housebreak. The prey drive of this breed won\u2019t be a problem if you introduce them to other pets at a young age. Similarly, socialization will also help to combat their shyness. The average height of the Carolina Dog is between 17 and 24 inches. These dogs typically weigh between 30 and 44 pounds. The Carolina Dog is naturally shy around humans but, once they become a member of a \u201cpack\u201d or family, they become fiercely devoted and loyal. These dogs are energetic and active, eager to play and they typically adjust well to family life. This breed has a well-developed hunting instinct but proper socialization and early introductions will make him compatible with other family pets. These dogs get along well with children and they thrive in an environment with a strong pack leader. Because the Carolina Dog is a primitive breed it does not display many of the same health problems that other domesticated breeds do. These dogs are less prone to genetic conditions than many domesticated breeds and they typically have a long lifespan. However, recent discoveries indicate that Carolina Dogs can be overly sensitive to ivermectin, a substance often found in mite treatments or heartworm drugs. Before you administer any anti-parasitic medication or treatment, make sure to consult a vet. The average life expectancy of the Carolina Dog is between 12 and 15 years. The Carolina Dog is a primitive breed and, as such, it is highly active. These dogs require a great deal of daily exercise to meet their energy needs and they will also appreciate having outdoor space in which to run and play. As a result, these dogs are not suited to life in condos or apartments. Ideally, they would find their forever home in a house with a big securely fenced yard, or even better on a farm- these are independent dogs who like their \u201cme time\u201d for exploration and playtime. A Carolina Dog will need circa 60 minutes of deliberate exercise each day. It\u2019s mandatory for it to be outside, as being cooped up indoors is never a good thing for dogs, especially for such an active and independent breed. Take them on hikes, long walks, and give them free safe space to do their thing- this will keep them both happy and healthy.

This is a registry for rare purebred dogs that are on route to get recognition, once they fulfill all of the requirements. Having a national breed club with representative membership of about 100 active members, and a breed standard are some of those prerequisites.  The AKC says for the Carolina Dogs that they are loyal, independent and reserved with strangers. \u201c (They) are generally shy and suspicious in nature, but once a dog accepts a human into its pack, those behaviors disappear toward that human.\u201d This breed is accepted by the United Kennel Club as well as the American Rare Breed Association and the National Kennel Club. The Carolina Dog has a short, ginger-colored coat that closely resembles the coat of the Australian Dingo and the Korean native breed, the Jindo.

To this day, these spotted dogs are the only breed in history that originates from this state. It\u2019s a unique dog from a unique part of America. While Catahoula\u2019s importance in his native region is undeniable, its true origin is unclear. There are a few theories surrounding this unusual breed, but two seem to be most popular. One is that the Catahoula Leopard Dog was first bred by Native Americans in the 16th century, who crossed their own dogs with the settler\u2019s Greyhounds and Molossers. The other theory proposes that  French settlers bred their Beauceron dogs to Native Americans\u2019 blue-eyed canines. Regardless, this special hybrid came as a result of the same unique mix of cultures that make Louisiana such a remarkable place.  Whatever the real story is, it\u2019s clear that the many distinct qualities of these dogs ensured they\u2019ve retained popularity in the region even centuries later. The Catahoula Leopard Dog was developed because of his intense work ethic as well as its ability to hunt wild hogs and feral cows, but has continued to reign supreme in Louisiana because it\u2019s just an all-around fantastic canine.

For that reason (amongst others), it\u2019s wise to consult with your veterinarian before determining or changing your dog\u2019s diet.

It is essential that the family that incorporates a Catahoula Leopard Dog into the household be assertive and unyielding when it comes to the dominance within the pack. The dog must completely understand that the humans in the pack are ranked higher than he is or all hell could break loose. This doesn\u2019t mean that he should not be loved or treated as a family member; he simply must know his place within the household. An alpha relationship must be established early and training should be approached with a firm, yet friendly hand. This breed is highly intelligent and takes well to training. For training to be effective, the lessons should be short, repetitive and calm. Yummy treats will be a great reward for a task well done. It\u2019s important to establish a training routine early and often. This is not a dog that will be easily trained by first-time dog owners. In fact, enrolling this pup in some sort of training and/or obedience program is likely for the best. These are loyal and lovable animals once trained, but if this process isn\u2019t handled properly during the pup\u2019s young and impressionable years, the Catahoula Leopard Dog can be a tiny terror. The average Catahoula Leopard Dog weighs somewhere between 50 and 90 pounds and are between 20 and 26 inches tall at the withers. Of course, females tend to be smaller than males. If bred properly, the Catahoula Leopard Dog is not aggressive toward people. However, they are watchful and cautious when strangers are around. They do have an assertive nature so they need an owner or family that is assertive as well. Passive owners will quickly lose their Alpha status and the dog will end up ruling the home. This is unacceptable, so it is important to realize that although the Catahoula Leopard Dog is wonderful, he is not the right dog for everyone. Only a certain type of owner can handle this particular animal. Not an incessant barker, the Catahoula Leopard Dog will surely alert his family of strangers or cars approaching. He will also alert when other animals approach and oftentimes, will attack animals that do not belong on your property. This will include other pets that accidentally get out of their homes and make their way to yours. In other words, this isn\u2019t exactly a dog that will do well in an apartment building or in any area densely populated with other pets. As with many large breeds of dogs, the Catahoula Leopard Dog is predisposed to hip dysplasia. Even a litter out of two adult dogs that are known to be free from hip dysplasia can result in 25 percent of the puppies having some level of hip dysplasia. To reduce the incidence of hip problems, puppies should have limited exercise and not be allowed to run and play on tile floors or with adult dogs until they are older and more stable. Deafness can be an issue with Catahoula Leopard Dogs. Health clearances on the parents can help to decrease this problem within the breed, but there are no guarantees. Deaf dogs can lead happy lives. They just need to use hand signals and other alerting methods for working with the dog. It\u2019s important to schedule regular checkups with your vet so that any potential health issues can be identified and treated early. The average Catahoula Leopard Dog lives between 12 and 13 years. Catahoula Leopard Dogs are high-energy and athletic dogs that were bred to herd wild boar and cows. They need serious exercise that not only gets their bodies moving but also stimulates their minds. A stroll through the park just isn\u2019t enough for the average Catahoula Leopard Dog. He needs to use his skills and inherent drive to work. His work ethic is strong and unstoppable. The Catahoula will not be happy unless he has a productive job to do. These dogs need owners who can keep up with them, not the other way around. This breed attaches to his human family quickly and does not thrive living outdoors or inside of an outbuilding. He needs to be close to his family as the Catahoula Leopard Dog needs attention and affection from his loved ones. It is also his desire to protect his family from harm and as a result, he must live in the house with his humans. Catahoula Leopard Dogs are watchful and cautious when strangers are around. The Catahoula Leopard Dog is not recognized by the AKC, but it is a part of their Foundation Stock Service. This program allows breeders of rare dogs to record the birth and the family trees of their litters, as they are working to create a fully established dog breed. This only works if the dog is a purebred (like the Catahoula Leopard Dog). The goal is to increase the numbers of the said rare purebred dogs, and fulfill AKC set requirements to eventually get full recognition. The American Kennel Club states \u201cThe Catahoula Leopard Dog is a multi-purpose working dog that is well-muscled and powerful, but with a sense of agility and endurance. They are serious while working and playful at home.\u201d  The coat of a Catahoula Leopard Dog is short. Usually, the dog is black and tan or merle. Some of these dogs\u2019 coats are rather coarse and for the most part, they are tight. Their eye color can vary drastically and it is not uncommon for a dog to have two different colored eyes or even a single eye that has two colors. These are dogs with dramatic eyes. You will notice those peepers, whether you like it or not. Catahoula Leopard Dogs should be bathed seasonally or when they become filthy or smelly. A weekly brushing will help to remove loose dirt and debris from the coat. They shed minimally but while they are shedding, brushing should be done several times each week. Catahoula puppies are cute, energetic and mischievous. The same as any other puppy, really. However, their cuteness shouldn\u2019t be an excuse to let them walk all over you. You need to set the foundation for your future relationship early on and establish yourself as the alpha. It\u2019s never too early to start slowly training your new pet, even if it is only baby steps in the beginning!  Puppies should absolutely start being socialized as soon as they are brought to their new homes. They should also begin formal puppy kindergarten once their vaccines are completed. This will help them to become wonderful and functional members of your family.", "facts": " AKC Foundation Stock Service Families with children, houses with yards, experienced owners, farms/rural areas Hard working, protective, independent, energetic", "tags": "bloat, Catahoula Leopard Dogs, dominant, experienced dog owners, herding, heterochromia, high-energy, hip dysplasia, hunting dog, Louisiana, "}, "catalan sheepdog": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/catalan-sheepdog/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/catalan-sheepdog.jpg", "name": "Catalan Sheepdog", "type": "dog", "text": "When you hear the word \u201csheepdog\u201d you probably picture a medium-sized dog with a long, shaggy coat.

This breed is descendent from ancient Molosser breeds, used by local herders to protect their flocks from large predators and from thieves. Though used throughout the Caucasian area, this breed is most popular in Russia \u2013 in fact, its nickname \u201cOvtcharka\u201d means \u201csheepdog\u201d in Russian. Though these dogs are not as frequently used for sheep guarding as they once were, breeding programs still exist in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. Today, these dogs are known for their massive size and protective capabilities. The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is recognized by the FCI but it is not currently eligible for registration with the AKC. Rather, the breed is part of the Foundation Stock Service which is designed to oversee the development of the breed until it is available in sufficient numbers to become eligible for registration. This breed is descendant from large Molasser breeds in the Caucasus Mountains. Due to this breed\u2019s size, they require a food formulated for large-breed dogs.

Caucasian Shepherd dogs are very strong and alert \u2013 they will bravely defend their families but they require a firm hand in leadership and training to prevent them from becoming unmanageable. The main thing working against this breed is its massive size. Most bloodlines for this breed carry the gene for rear dysplasia and the size of the breed contributes to its increased risk for musculoskeletal issues. Cancer is also fairly common in this breed along with obesity and heart problems. Responsible breeding practices may help to reduce the incidence of these conditions but, unfortunately, inbreeding is fairly common with this breed which only serves to increase the risk for health problems. The average lifespan for the Caucasian Shepherd Dog is fairly short due to its size and a number of common health problems. This breed tends to live a maximum of 10 to 12 years.

But what\u2019s in a name, really? After all, a breed that goes by the term Cavalier King Charles Spaniel really has to deliver on a lot of promises that its name makes: is this breed really such a noble animal that it should be named after a king? Well, that\u2019s always up for each individual dog owner to decide, but if you\u2019re like us, you think the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is one of the most ideal pet breeds available today. Although their popularity still has room for improvement here in North America, there are plenty of Cavalier King Charles Spaniel owners overseas who are perfectly content with the type of dog and household friend they\u2019ve found in this breed. Often white and brown with a smaller frame but a friendly disposition, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is really one of the ideal pets for domestic life. But you\u2019re about to learn a lot more of this breed, including the answer to one crucial question: might this be the dog breed for you and your family? The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is one of the most ideal pet breeds available today. As you might imagine from the name, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel traces its roots back to royalty. In England, King Charles II was known for his \u201clittle dogs\u201d and clearly had a preference for toy group-type breeds. There is even a legend that the King issued an edict that the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel-type dog could not be denied entrance to any public place \u2013 a high honor indeed, if it is true. From that information alone, you can guess that the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has been around in Europe for several hundred years, although it has not always been the most popular of toy breeds. Believe it or not, the pug was popular in Northern Europe at around the time of the 17th century. Ultimately, it\u2019s been up to the 19th and 20th centuries to rebuild the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breed, using old paints as a template, as some of their heritage had been lost during the breeding of the past few hundred years. These days, you can find a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel frequently in England and the United Kingdom in general, and an ever-increasing amount in the United States. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel finds its pedigree with a number of dogs because of its slightly odd breeding history. The original Cavalier King Charles Spaniels were around and had been bred from other toy dogs and spaniels during the 16th century or so, but modern day breeders have been using other methods of breeding to bring a more pure version of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel back into existence. As a toy breed, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel doesn\u2019t have a necessarily large diet compared to other dogs, but it\u2019s important to remember that it is one of the heaviest and largest toy breeds in existence. A full, lustrous coat will require good nutrition and care, so be sure to feed your dog good whole foods like meat and vegetables in addition to a normal dog diet of kibbles and treats. As you might imagine from the name, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel traces its roots back to royalty. These dogs are very friendly and known for being patient, and their eagerness to please is considered a plus for dog trainers who don\u2019t have a lot of experience in shaping a dog\u2019s behavior. This is great news if you\u2019re new to the world of dog training and could really use an easier dog to handle. A weight of 10-18 pounds makes this a relatively large toy breed, and suggests its heritage as a dog bred for being comfortable on your lap. About 10-18 pounds is actually a high degree of variance, so just be sure that your dog appears to have a weight proportional to its general build and height. Ideal for a life with children and in neighborhoods with other dogs, the temperament of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is just about as good as you\u2019ll find for a companion dog. It won\u2019t necessarily make a great or aggressive guard dog, but it will get along with your children and other dogs just fine. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels do have some problems with health, particularly in the world of genetic diseases. For example, almost all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels eventually run into heart troubles in the form of Mitral valve disease, a disease that can eventually lead to heart failure down the line. Syringomyelia is another disease that affects the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel worse than in other dogs and since it affects the spine and brain; it can be a particularly difficult one for your dog to endure. A life expectancy of around 9 to 14 years should be expected, with the high degree of variance explained by the breed\u2019s propensity to a number of health problems and hereditary diseases. Lively dogs, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniels will require good daily exercise and enjoy a good amount of play \u2013 you may find it to be a difficult dog to wear out if you aren\u2019t ready for it. These dogs are very friendly and known for being patient, and their eagerness to please is considered a plus. The American Kennel Club rates the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel as an \u201celegant, energetic toy breed that is compatible for city or country life.\u201d A longer coat that can have a really great shine and attractive look means that you\u2019ll want to go the extra mile to ensure the coat is taken care of and groomed properly.

It would tough to find a dog that\u2019s been domesticated for longer and frankly, this one lives up to the hype. The Central Asian Shepherd Dog is one of the oldest of dog breeds in the world with a history spanning back more than 5,000 years. This is not a breed created by man and instead this is a breed that originated as a result of their climate and circumstance, for better or worse. The Central Asian Shepherd Dog is a large and powerfully built dog. Its legs are well-boned and muscular. Its back is broad and powerful. The dog\u2019s head is large and its short, powerful neck has an abundance of dewlap. Central Asian Shepherd Dogs come in long and short coat varieties. The most common colors for this breed are white, fawn, black and brindle. One unique characteristic with this breed is that it can encompass a variety of breed types. And thus the temperament of each dog can vary depending on its breed line. In other words, there are many different types of Central Asian Sherpard out there, even if they may look similar. Thousands of years ago when these dogs first formed their bonds with the humans of the Central Asian region, they were used for a variety of purposes ranging from herding to dog fighting. Therefore three distinct breed types exist today with specific temperaments and instincts based on the purposes that they were originally bred for. An important point to note here is that dog fighting is an important part of the culture of many of the regions from which these dogs originated. We certainly do not approve of dog fighting, however it is undeniably an important part of the history of this specific breed. In ancient times, the shepherds of these regions would gather on occasion and fight their most prized dogs to determine the strongest. These fights were rarely lethal and often the weaker, more submissive dogs would back down before there was an actual physical fight. Breed lines that are bred as fighting dogs often have a higher propensity towards aggression towards other dogs and need much more experienced handlers. So, it\u2019s worth mentioning and keeping in mind should you choose to pursue this breed. Breed lines that have been bred as herders and livestock guardians have very different protective instincts. Whichever breed type a Central Asian hails from, they are in no way suitable for first-time dog owners. These are dogs that require an experienced hand and delicate approach to raise right. For the right owner, they can be extraordinary companions. For the wrong owner, it will be a disaster for dog and human. Which group do your fall into? Well, you\u2019ve come to the right place to find out. Keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away to learn everything that you could possibly want to know about the Central Asian Shepherd Dog! The Central Asian Shepherd Dog is one of the oldest of dog breeds in the world with a history spanning back more than 5,000 years. It is believed that the first Central Asian Shepherd Dogs originated in the regions of Ural, the Caspian Sea, Asia Minor and the Northwest border of China. The former USSR first created the breed standard for this breed. However, with the end of the Soviet Union, a modern breed standard was created in Russia which has resulted in a modern version of the breed called the Central Asian Ovcharka. The history of this breed is deep and varied. There\u2019s no one specific breeder or even region that can be pointed to as a place of origin. The story of the Central Asian Shepherd Dog is simply too rich for any simple answers like that. As with most ancient breeds, not much is known of the specific pedigree of the Central Asian Shepherd Dog. Some experts believe that the Tibetian Mastiff is a forefather of this ancient breed. Unfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to do anything more than guess the forefather of any dog this old. There wasn\u2019t exactly documentation kept about breed history 5,000 years ago. Central Asians are extremely large dogs and consume massive amounts of food each day. It is also important that their food supply their daily nutritional needs as well as their energy needs. Choose a reputable brand of kibble is always best, geared to your pooch\u2019s size and nutritional needs. But how much should you specifically feed your Central Asian Shepherd? The best way to answer that question is to consult with a veterinarian. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still just guidelines and should not be treated as gospel. All dogs are different after all, each with their own needs regardless of the breed. The only person qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is a vet. So always rely on their expertise before making any significant changes to what goes in your dog\u2019s food dish. Central Asian Shepherds are an extremely intelligent breed of dog. Central Asian Shepherds are an extremely intelligent breed of dog. The most important step when training these dogs is to first establish leadership and a strong bond with the dog. This dog needs an owner that can handle it with a firm but loving hand. Once the dog sees the human as its pack leader, they can be trained easily with most positive reward based training methods. A harsh hand can often backfire when training these giants. It\u2019s certainly a tricky balance to maintain an alpha status while focusing entirely on positive training techniques. However, that\u2019s a vital balance to strike to properly train this breed. The difficulty involved in training these pooches is why we strongly suggest that only experienced trainers take on the task. However, if you were are a first-time dog owner who is determined to bring home a Central Asian Shepherd Dog, it\u2019s certainly still possible bring them up right. We just highly recommend involving a professional dog trainer or enrolling in some sort of obedience school to make things a little easier for your and your pup. Full grown Central Asian Shepherd Dogs can weigh up to 176 pounds. One of the most important aspects of understanding a Central Asian Shepherd Dog\u2019s temperament is understanding its breed type and the associated instincts and characteristics that come along with it. For example, dogs that come from fighting lines will often be much more dog aggressive and will require a great deal of socialization and supervision around other dogs. In general however, these dogs are highly self assured and intelligent and are extremely brave. While not unduly aggressive, they will not hesitate to attack if they sense that their owner is in grave danger and will protect their masters to the death. They are also naturally weary of strangers and will alert their masters promptly to any strange intrusions. They also have a loud booming bark and make for excellent watchdogs and guard dogs. Central Asians are extremely protective and devoted to their families. They are also extremely affectionate towards children. However, they should always be supervised around youngsters as they can accidentally topple or hurt toddlers due to their extremely large size. The Central Asian Shepherd Dog does not have any known hereditary ailments and is generally considered to be a very healthy breed. However, like most large breeds, they are prone to hip and elbow dysplasia. As always, it is important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a veterinarian (especially as your pooch ages into his senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as quickly as possible. A well cared for Central Asian Shepherd can often live for 14 years or more. Although these dogs may look like lazy giants, they are a hard working breed and require regular strenuous exercise. These dogs were bred to work for extended periods of time and they do best with long and drawn out exercise sessions. They make excellent jogging and hiking partners. Central Asians are extremely protective and devoted to their families. The Central Asian Shepherd Dog was included in the American Kennel Club\u2019s Foundation Stock Service in 1996. Neither the long haired or short haired variety of this dog requires a great deal of care in terms of grooming. They are however heavy seasonal shedders and should be brushed more often during the shedding season.

Bred to hunt in packs, the Cesky Terrier  is a short-legged and well-muscled dog. Its head is wedge shaped and its high-set, triangular shaped ears fold forward onto its head. The Cesky\u2019s coat is distinctively long and silky and its face sports a bushy beard, moustache and eyebrows. Like most breeds of terrier, the Cesky is energetic and playful, but is comparatively more reserved and trainable. They are an extremely affectionate breed of dog and get along excellently with children. However, they are prone to stubborn and willful behavior when not given strong leadership. Therefore it is important that the Cesky\u2019s owner establishes himself as the pack leader early on. The Cesky Terrier is one of the six rarest dogs in the world and is also the national dog of the Czech Republic. The Cesky (pronounced Chess-key) Terrier, or Bohemian Terrier is a relatively new breed of terrier. The Cesky Terrier was created by Mr. Frantisik Horak by crossing Scottish Terriers with Sealyham Terriers. Mr. Frantisik Horak\u2019s intention was to create a hunting dog with a body narrow enough to be able to retrieve prey from dens and burrows in the forests of Bohemia. The breed was first imported to the USA in 1987 and is still an extremely rare breed. The Cesky Terriers ancestors are the Scottish Terrier and the Sealyham Terrier. Cesky Terriers can be fed twice a day on high quality kibble or raw/canned food. Care should be taken not to over-feed them as they have voracious appetites and will often over-eat. Originally bred as hunting dogs, Cesky Terriers are highly intelligent and extremely obedient, making them fairly easy to train. Originally bred as hunting dogs, Cesky Terriers are highly intelligent and extremely obedient, making them fairly easy to train. However, like most terrier breeds, they can be willful and stubborn when not given strong leadership. Therefore it is important to maintain a calm and assertive authority when handling this dog. Cesky Terriers weigh between 13 to 23 pounds. Cesky Terriers are one of the milder and easier going breeds of terriers and make excellent companions for owners young and old. They are extremely gentle with children of all ages and get along well with dogs and other animals, provided that they are socialized well from an early age. Cesky Terriers love people and are fairly trusting of strangers. They are also very brave and highly attentive and make good guard dogs. Strong and assertive leadership is important with these dogs as they can turn stubborn and willful when they feel that they are pack leaders. They can also develop small dog syndrome and other aggressive tendencies if not given rules, boundaries and limitations from an early age. The Cesky Terrier is, generally speaking, a very healthy breed of dog. Some may occasionally suffer from Scotty Cramp which can cause awkward movement. However, this disease is not painful or life threatening. A well-cared-for Cesky Terrier will often live for up to 15 years. Like all terriers, Cesky Terriers are a highly energetic breed and require regular exercise and play. When not given the chance to spend their excess energy they can often turn destructive. Therefore they are best suited for families with large yards or gardens where these dogs can play and romp freely. However, they are also able to live in smaller living spaces provided that they are given regular exercise. Although a small breed of dog, they make excellent jogging and hiking partners and should be walked for at least an hour each day. Cesky Terriers are one of the milder and easier going breeds of terriers and make excellent companions for owners young and old. The AKC has this to say about the Cesky Terrier: \u201cThe Cesky Terrier is a well-muscled, short legged and well-pigmented hunting terrier that was developed to be worked in packs. The breed originated in the Czech Republic and is considered one of the country\u2019s national breeds. As such, it has been featured on postage stamps, on television, in books and even in a movie. The Cesky has natural drop ears, a natural tail, and sports a soft, long, silky coat in shades of gray from charcoal to platinum.\u201d The Cesky Terrier was officially accepted into the Foundation Stock Service Program by the American Kennel Club in 2004. Grooming makes up a significant part of the Cesky Terrier\u2019s care and maintenance. Their hair should be trimmed at least four times a year with an electric clipper. They are generally not stripped like most other breeds of terriers. It is also important to brush the Cesky Terrier\u2019s long hair at least twice a week to prevent it from knotting and tangling. Cesky Terrier puppies should be socialized at a very young age with strangers and other animals. This socialization should continue throughout their life due to their somewhat reserved nature towards strangers.", "facts": " AKC Terrier  Families with children, active singles, active seniors, houses with yards Mild, reserved, calm, cheerful", "tags": "Bohemian Terrier, Cesky Terrier, Czech Republic, Frantisik Horak, Hunting Dogs, jogging, rare breed, Scotty Cramp, "}, "chesapeake bay retriever": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/chesapeake-bay-retriever", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/chesapeake-bay-retrievers.jpg", "name": "Chesapeake Bay Retriever", "type": "dog", "text": "For many people, understanding dogs is simple. They find a friendly, loyal, easy-to-get-along with breed like the Golden Retriever or Labrador Retriever and they\u2019ll never want for a good friend again. But for the dog lover who appreciates all sorts of breeds, the Retriever doesn\u2019t only sporty, friendly dog most of us grew up learning about. There\u2019s more to the retriever story, and one only has to travel to the United States \u2013 and the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, specifically \u2013 to find it. Of course, by now you know we\u2019re referring to the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, perhaps one of the great under-appreciated dog breeds out there. You won\u2019t have to look far to find a quality dog after you\u2019ve encounter a Chesapeake Bay Retriever or two; many times, whether you live on your own or with a family, a great Chesapeake Bay Retriever will be exactly what you\u2019ve been looking for in a dog. The uniquely American heritage and breeding is a benefit to those of us who keep our dog breeds simply and domestic. Here\u2019s a little bit more about this great breed of dog that more people should be talking about. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a classic retriever when it comes to behavior and training. You don\u2019t have to be a rocket scientist or, more fittingly, a dog historian to figure out where the Chesapeake Bay Retriever hails from. It\u2019s not a trick question: the Chesapeake Bay Retriever does indeed trace the origins of its unique breed to the Chesapeake bay on the Atlantic seaboard of the United States. What\u2019s unique about the origins of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, however, is that you can trace their lineage to two very specific dogs. These dogs, named Sailor and Canton, were brought to Maryland at the dawn of the 19th century and bred with other dogs in order to create a breed unique in and of itself. These two dogs weren\u2019t Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, but they were known as Newfoundland dogs, which suggest that you can indeed trace the history of the Chesapeake Bay Retrieve further back if you want. The retriever has become a favorite in the Maryland and Chesapeake Bay area, even becoming Maryland\u2019s state dog in 1964. If the history of Sailor and Canton is ever challenged, we at least know that the breed was recognized as its own in the late 19th century, not unlike many breeds we would consider \u201colder\u201d than the Chesapeake Bay Retriever. The current Chesapeake Bay Retriever does have a strong pedigree in its own breed \u2013 it\u2019s not very hard to find a purebred (depending on your location). Given the strong history of breeding and development in the United States, it\u2019s had a consistent record as being a recognized and standardized breed for over a hundred years. Moving backward in time, however, the detail about the Chesapeake Bay Retriever\u2019s pedigree can get a little trickier. Although this breed is younger than ancient breeds like those you\u2019ll find in Asia, it is difficult to trace western dog history because of the high degree of breeding and development throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The two \u201cparents\u201d of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever were known to be Newfoundland dogs, which suggest an entire history in and of itself. Considered a mid-to-large sized dog, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever might go through more food than you expect. Protein is important, including lean meats and good poultry. Using chicken stock for flavoring can be a great way to enhance the nutrition and flavor of many of its meals. Don\u2019t be afraid to feed your dog a healthy-sized diet if it gets plenty of exercise. The uniquely American heritage and breeding is a benefit to those of us who keep our dog breeds simply and domestic. In many ways, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a classic retriever when it comes to behavior and training. They are loyal, easy to get along with, and don\u2019t mind being put to work. This breed especially has been bred for water retrieving and other similar activities, so helping them understand their role in your family can include those sporty activities. Generally, a well-socialized Chesapeake Bay Retriever will be about as friendly as you can hope a big dog to get. Proper training and raising, as always, is important for any dog. Weighing around 55 to 80 pounds \u2013 you can expect the males to outweigh females at an average of ten pounds, which puts them on the higher end rather than the lower end \u2013 these dogs are relatively large so you\u2019ll want to make sure they\u2019re properly trained if they\u2019re going to spend time around your family. They\u2019re largely non-threatening but having any animal of this size in the house will require caution. Similar to other retrievers in look, behavior, and personality, you won\u2019t find a lot of deviation from the classic \u201cretriever\u201d mindset here. A friendly disposition should usually be expected, though like any dog it can have its problems if it hasn\u2019t been raised to socialize with people or other dogs properly. Hip dysplasia is common in Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, as it is in any larger dog. Type 3 von Willebrand disease has also shown to be a higher risk in these dogs, as well as a few other ailments you might want to talk to your veterinarian about. A life expectancy of 10-12 years is usually normal for a fairly healthy Chesapeake Bay Retriever. These dogs are good exercisers and intelligent athletes as well \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid to give them challenges like retrieving toys and Frisbees, or even to take them out swimming in the appropriate settings. They love to move and love to have a task to get them moving, so be sure you indulge this on a regular basis. You may even find that short, brisk walks aren\u2019t enough for this breed. They are loyal, easy to get along with, and don\u2019t mind being put to work. These retrievers have been called a \u201ctruly American\u201d breed by the American Kennel Club, and we tend to agree. A brown coat that doesn\u2019t deviate much in color also comes a double coat. Properly socializing a Chesapeake Bay Retriever from a young age is important \u2013 it should be used to the presence of other people and other dogs.

He is a black-and-white hound that originated in France and is used for hunting in packs. These dogs have a long history of hunting behind them and they are still used today to hunt red deer. The exact origins of the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir are unknown, but he is thought to have been developed from various French and English Hounds. This is one of three Chien Fran\u00e7ais breeds, each of which is named for its coloration \u2013 the other two are the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Orange and the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Tricolore. The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir\u2019s history lies in the old Hound of Saintonge, a breed that almost completely disappeared during the French Revolution. The breed was revived as the Gascon-Santongeois breed in the mid-19th century and then crossbred with the Poitevin in the late 19th century to produce the modern Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir. The breed was officially registered in 1957 and is currently recognized by the FCI and the UKC. The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir is one of three French hounds classified as Chien Fran\u00e7ais and is thought to have been developed from a mixture of existing and extinct French and English hounds. As a large-breed dog, the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir should be fed a high-quality commercial diet formulated for larger breeds. Protein is extremely important for this breed to maintain lean muscle mass and he may require more fat than other dogs to sustain his energy for hunting. You may even want to consider an active or working breed formula to meet his high energy requirements. The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir is an intelligent breed that usually responds well to positive reinforcement training methods. This breed is bred to hunt in packs, so he is very independent-minded and sometimes gets along better with other dogs than with people. He is not willful by nature but can become stubborn, so a firm and consistent hand in training is required and this breed is best for experienced dog owners. If you don\u2019t choose to train your dog for hunting, consider training him for another dog sport to keep him active and engaged. The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir is a large breed that stands 26 to 28 inches tall and weighs 50 to 80 pounds. Females of the breed tend to be a little smaller. The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir is born and bred as a hunting dog. More specifically, he is bred to hunt in packs with little direction from his owner \u2013 this means that he can sometimes be a little stubborn and independent. These dogs are not overly willful, however, and they are very loyal and dedicated to their families. The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir usually does well in multi-dog households but they do need plenty of socialization to get along with other household pets. The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir is generally a healthy breed, though he may be prone to field injuries like all working breeds. This breed is also at-risk for ear infections due to his long, pendulous ears and his size may predispose him to musculoskeletal issues like hip dysplasia as well as gastric torsion or bloat. The average lifespan for the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir is 12 to 15 years. As a hunting breed, the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir has excellent stamina and high needs for exercise. This breed requires at least an hour of moderate to vigorous exercise and will appreciate having a fenced yard in which to run. This breed may do well in training for dog sports and also requires mental stimulation in addition to physical exercise. The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir is not currently recognized by the AKC but it is a member of the Scenthound group for the UKC and was recognized as such by the FCI in 1957. The Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir has a short coat of the typical hound type. It is black and white in color with a black mantle. Some dogs of this breed exhibit blue or black speckling or some tan markings, but these are only permissible on the legs. The breed sheds moderately but grooming is simple. Puppies The average litter size for the Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir breed is 3 to 8 puppies. Puppies should be started with socialization and training as early as possible.

People of all personalities can find something that will attract them to this dog breed.

You wouldn\u2019t know to look at it, but the Chihuahua makes an excellent watchdog \u2013 of course, you shouldn\u2019t expect it to protect you from any threat (even though many rodents could easily over power this pup). So, is the Chihuahua the right pet to join your family? There\u2019s only one way to find out. Read on to learn more about this fantastic breed. We are about to reveal everything that it is worth knowing about the finest toy dog to ever come out of Mexico. Sporting a large head, expressive eyes and a friendly disposition, the Chihuahua fits into the lifestyle of many types of households. Delving into the Chihuahua\u2019s history, historians can make a good guess at how this breed came to be, although as with most dog breed histories, it is hard to verify. What we do know is that the breed is named after a Mexican city and was first seen around the Aztec era. Even though it is named after a particular city, the Chihuahua was likely plentiful all over the country. And you can consider the Chihuahua an ancient breed \u2013 it can be dated as far back as 500 A.D. This dog dives deep into the annals of Mexican history. There\u2019s a reason the pup is such a beloved export from that country. In a way, the Chihuahua is part of the foundation of modern Mexico. The evolution of the Chihuahua can be such an interesting glimpse into the overall development of dog breeds in South America. After ancient peoples colonized this continent far back in history, the primitive dogs that accompanied them were isolated from any outside influence. The interbreeding that occurred over the following millenia led to quite a unique genetic footprint \u2013 and that is why Chihuahuas are so unique in looks and character! As such, they share many similarities with the other popular ancient dog breed from Mexico \u2013 the Xoloitzcuintli. Together, they held an important place in the culture and society of the ancient inhabitants of Mexico, such as the Aztecs. Since the background of the Chihuahua is a bit hazy, it\u2019s a bit difficult to pinpoint this breed\u2019s pedigree. What is known is that these small dogs were used for ceremonies and companionship. Some experts think the Chihuahua may have been bred from the Fennec Fox, a small animal with big eyes and ears \u2013 quite similar to the features found on the tiny dog. Beyond that, it\u2019s hard to say exactly how the Chihuahua came to be. The history of dog breeds simply isn\u2019t that well documented. But regardless of the origin, there\u2019s no denying that this breed will endure for many generations to come. The Chihuahua was recognized by the AKC at a fairly late point in time considering the ancient origins of the breed- in 1904. When pedigree and looks are regarded, Chihuahua sports some very distinct features that are unique and characteristic of this breed. They can have a distinct \u201capple head\u201d form, or a \u201cdeer head\u201d form. Moreover, Chihuahuas can have a short, smooth coat, or a long one. When coloration is considered, anything goes! Chihuahuas have many accepted color combinations. A good and balanced diet is always a safe bet when it comes to feeding your Chihuahua. This breed does well with a mix of protein, grain, and vegetables. When giving out treats, moderation is essential. Since the Chihuahua is so small, even the tiniest bit of extra weight can make a huge difference in its health. For this reason, the diet of your Chihuahua must be carefully monitored. Before establishing or even making any changes to your dog\u2019s diet, it\u2019s worth consulting with a veterinarian. While dog food manufacturers provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still guidelines and hardly gospel. All dogs are different after all, each with their own specific needs. Only your vet is qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pup. So always check in with them to ensure that you find the right feeding program for your Chihuahua. Now, considering that these puppers are truly tiny it can be rare for them to develop obesity. However, it is still a possibility, and due to their short legs and stumpy physique, all extra weight can come as a serious challenge and obstacle. Their stumpy legs simply can\u2019t take any extra weight, so always pay attention to that balanced and measured diet.

When it comes to basic tricks, Chihuahuas are easy to train. Since this dog always loves to please its owners, it will willingly sit, shake, and roll over\u2026 as long as your Chihuahua is rewarded with a treat, of course. You\u2019ll find that training is one of the best and most fun parts of owning a Chihuahua. That\u2019s not something that can be said about most dogs. So cherish the ease and joy of this process. In general, these doggos are quite inquisitive and smart, and always ready for new experiences. And heck, if there is a treat to be had \u2013 tricks and obedience are all in order!  That\u2019s the good news. Here\u2019s the bad news. House training, on the other hand, is not as easy with Chihuahuas. This will take some extra time, as this pup has a tough time learning where to go. Although some people use litter boxes or pee pads, even this can be difficult. In the long run, you should train your Chihuahua to do its business outdoors, if possible. On the other hand, if you begin training at a very early age, you might be more successful here. Of course, as is common with all super tiny doggos, Chihuahuas too can be quite willful and stubborn \u2013 always wanting things to go their own way. This means that it\u2019s wise to start the training process as early as possible to take advantage of your puppy\u2019s early and impressionable years. It\u2019s also vital to focus on positive reinforcement and rewards in your training to ensure the best results. Anything less is closer to abuse that training. This is both cruel to your dog and won\u2019t yield the results that you crave.  Both male and female Chihuahuas can weigh anywhere from six to nine pounds. You\u2019re absolutely right \u2013 that\u2019s a super lightweight category. Nevertheless, it is proportional to their size and height \u2013 anything above or below this weight might not be so good. Of course, being so light, Chihuahuas can be a bit fragile and require just a tad bit of extra attention so as to not be squished. The Chihuahua is devoted to its owners and as such, it needs a lot of attention. From its point of view, it\u2019s only fair. After all, since your dog is devoted to you, you\u2019d better be devoted to it too.  So if you can give your dog this much attention, the Chihuahua is for you. To keep your dog happy, it will need to be around you all the time. If it feels slighted, you could be on the receiving end of some bad behavior. This pup will try to teach negligent owners a lesson that they won\u2019t soon forget. It\u2019s also worth noting that the Chihuahua may not play nice with other dogs, which may pose a problem if you have other animals in the house. If you like to have a house full of pets, try to keep them all Chihuahuas. Otherwise, your little Chihuahua could prove to be a major troublemaker in your household. Like most dog breeds, there are various health problems that are common with Chihuahuas you should be aware of.  Some common health problems that Chihuahuas may suffer from include hemophilia, hypoglycemia, epilepsy, jawbone disorders and heart murmurs. In addition to these problems, Chihuahuas are prone to bladder and kidney stones. You\u2019ll know if your dog as a kidney or bladder stone if your see blood in its urine or if it is only urinating small amounts at a time. It\u2019s always wise to regularly schedule check ups with your vet (especially as your dog ages into his senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. It is good to know that Chihuahuas with the \u201capple head\u201d appearance can have certain health problems related to their stubby and deformed snouts. Nasal and jawbone problems might occur.  Chihuahuas have a life expectancy of 14 to 18 years. With proper care, balanced diet, and regular vet visits, they can easily reach the high end of that lifespan. It is a little over the usual doggo lifespan, and that means that these tiny puppers can be your companion for a lot longer than it\u2019s the case with some bigger breeds. Since they are so small, Chihuahuas need very little exercise. In general, regular play indoors can be more than enough to keep a Chihuahua fit and healthy, but a daily walk certainly won\u2019t do this breed any harm either. If you\u2019ve got a small space, like an apartment, this pooch is the perfect pet for you. The space won\u2019t seem quite so small to this tiny pup. Even though this is primarily an indoor dog, it\u2019s still a good idea to get outdoors with your pooch. Let them get outside and enjoy the fresh air, and explore the world outside your house. It\u2019s also a great chance for your Chihuahua to socialize with other dogs and people (which is always important to any dog\u2019s wellbeing). The Chihuahua is devoted to its owners and as such, it needs a lot of attention. The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cGraceful, alert and swift-moving with a saucy expression, Chihuahuas are highly intelligent and should not be underestimated even though small in size.\u201d Chihuahuas come in two different coat lengths: long and short. For both varieties, its fur is glossy and smooth. Short-haired Chihuahuas have a coarser coat of hair, while the longhaired version is much softer. The hair on its body and tail is longer when compared to that found on its head and ears. With both long and short-haired Chihuahuas, you\u2019ll find quite a bit of shedding and you should brush them on a regular basis. Long-haired Chihuahuas require more brushing, as you\u2019ll want to prevent matting that may occur with the dog\u2019s coat. Since the Chihuahua breed is so small when fully grown, you can imagine how small it is when it\u2019s a puppy. Be careful with your Chihuahua puppy, especially around children. These puppies are tiny and fragile (in addition to being oh-so cute). Be sure to prepare your children for your Chihuahua\u2019s arrival and teach them to practice extra care around it. It\u2019s all too easy to injure one of these puppies by accident, so everyone in a household with a Chihuahua puppy should treat the animal with an especially gentle touch.

The Chinese Crested dog is considered among the best companion breeds for a number of reasons: not only for those mentioned, but for its appearance, general demeanor, and ability to perform tricks. In other words, acquiring a Chinese Crested for yourself and your family can be a great decision indeed. There are two kinds of Chinese Crested dogs \u2013 the Powderpuff and the Hairless. Both types are odorless, non-shedding, and hypo-allergenic, which makes them a great dog for allergy sufferers.

If there ever was a \u201chouse dog,\u201d this is one. The Chinese Crested dog is considered among the best companion breeds for a number of reasons. Despite what its name suggests, many people do not believe that the Chinese Crested actually originated in China. For one, the Chinese Crested does not keep in line with a number of ancient Chinese dogs like the Pug or the Chow Chow. The Chinese Crested has too recent a history to be counted among those breeds in pure historical longevity. Where, then, do Chinese Crested dogs hail from? Many believe it\u2019s actually Africa, being referred to as an African Hairless Terrier in texts across the 19th century. (Note: Of course, the 19th century is far off from the origins of the more ancient Chinese breeds.) Because there is genetic evidence of being related to the Mexican Hairless, this further confuses the issue, although following the genetic line will probably lead you to form a more accurate opinion. Those who do believe the Chinese Crested originated in China note that the Chinese Crested had a lot of maritime experience, being brought around by Chinese sailors. The truth is probably a combination of all of these, as the Chinese Crested was believed to have descended from African roots. Although called \u201cterriers\u201d back in the 19th century, the pedigree of the Chinese Crested deserves to be more associated with the aforementioned Mexican Hairless breed. Because there are two types of Chinese Crested breeds \u2013 hairless and \u201cpowderpuff\u201d \u2013 there is an argument to be made of a wide-ranging pedigree. But many historians believe the Chinese Crested breeds brought around by Chinese mariners in years past would have descended from the African hairless breeds already mentioned. The actual ancestry of modern Chinese Crested dogs also is tied through the breeds in Europe and America, where they began their formal recognition and widespread fame in the 19th and 20th centuries. As a very scrawny and small dog, a large diet is not needed. Because of this reason, nutritional impact must abound. Whole foods like lean meats and cuts of poultry will provide plenty of energy and nutrition. Treats are to usually be avoided except in training purposes. The Chinese Crested is a highly trainable dog that is open and intelligent enough to learn a wide variety of tricks. The Chinese Crested is a highly trainable dog that is open and intelligent enough to learn a wide variety of tricks. Because its temperament is patient and friendly, they make very trainable dogs and should be relatively easy for the beginner dog owner to \u201ctry a few things out.\u201d It\u2019s generally a good idea to train the Chinese Crested with positive reinforcement, as they are prone to becoming shy due to their size and temperament. Weighing only up to about ten pounds, this is indeed a tiny breed \u2013 and one you\u2019ll want to teach your kids to be very gentle with. One of the main attractions of the Chinese Crested is its personality. Friendly, patient, and non-barking, it makes many people feel that they\u2019ve made an instant friend, even if the dog is actually friendly to everyone. It\u2019s important, however, that the Chinese Crested doesn\u2019t become too shy around strangers, as even friendliness and non-aggressive personalities have limits. It\u2019s easy to over feed these dogs because of its small stature, so be careful. Ask yourself how much less food you would eat if you were only 10 pounds and you get an idea of just how small a diet these dogs can live on. The hairless variety of Chinese Crested is actually prone to tooth decay, so that will be something to keep an eye on during your regular visits to the veterinarian. Expect this dog to live around 10-12 years. Although every dog needs a good amount of regular, healthy exercise, this dog is not a big exerciser and is well-suited for apartment life. Because of its small stature, keep in mind that one mile to you is not the same as one mile to this dog. Friendly, patient, and non-barking, it makes many people feel that they\u2019ve made an instant friend. The American Kennel Club calls this breed a \u201c fine-boned, elegant toy dog that craves human companionship.\u201d With two ends on the spectrum \u2013 a puffy coat and a hairless \u201ccoat\u201d \u2013 the Chinese Crested will have a variety of different needs for grooming. The Powderpuff variety is a recessive gene, and these dogs are entirely covered with a double, very soft, straight coat. Many owners choose to shave their Puff in a \u201cPony Cut,\u201d leaving long hair on bottom of legs, tail, head and crest for easy care. Puff\u2019s are clean and have no doggie odor.  Of course, if you opt for the hairless variety, you don\u2019t have a lot of hair to worry about, do you? As tiny puppies, it\u2019s important to be gentle with the Chinese Crested dog. It\u2019s also important to socialize these dogs properly, as they can be prone to shyness. Exposing them to loud noises, strangers, and a generally open lifestyle will help them to be \u201cused\u201d to general city life in the future. As well-suited city or suburban dogs, they should be used to the presence of people and other dogs.", "facts": " AKC Toy Families with children, singles, seniors, apartments Playful, gentle, eager to please, devoted", "tags": "apartments, Chinese Crested, condos, hairless, Hypoallergenic Dogs, lap dog, lazy, non-barking, shy, tooth decay, toy breed, "}, "chinese shar-pei": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/chinese-shar-pei", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/shar-pei.jpg", "name": "Chinese Shar-Pei", "type": "dog", "text": "Let\u2019s put it this way: when you own a Chinese Shar-Pei, you know you own a Chinese Shar-Pei. It\u2019s one of the most distinctive-looking breeds available \u2013 certainly one of the dog breeds that makes other uninitiated dog lovers ask \u201cwhat breed is that?\u201d Well, they have good reason to be curious: this is actually one of the rarest breeds out there and despite its relatively rich history \u2013 considering the breed\u2019s numbers \u2013 it was not officially recognized by the American Kennel Club until 1991. The chances are if you\u2019re looking for a Chinese Shar-Pei, you\u2019re going to have more difficulty than simply making the decision of choosing the right breed for you. Acquiring this dog can be a bit difficult, but for many people, the adventure is worth it. A Shar-Pei can be a very protective dog that bonds well to a close-knit group of people, but without proper handling and training from a young age, it can become a bit territorial. Let\u2019s find out more about this impressive and rare breed of dog that will certainly become a main attraction wherever you decide to take it. A Shar-Pei can be a very protective dog that bonds well to a close-knit group of people. Where else could the Chinese Shar-Pei come from if not China? Its name roughly translating from Mandarin into English as \u201csand skin,\u201d the origin is similar to that of many old Chinese breeds like the pug. In other words, it goes back through a lot of history. Although no definitive dates are available regarding the early development of the Shar-Pei, historians believe it can be traced to the Guangdong province and southern provinces of China. During their early days in China, the Chinese Shar-Pei would be used for a number of reasons, often by peasants: the dogs could be used for protection, for hunting, and for herding animals. This has given the modern version a certain athletic versatility and a wide taste for different types of both exercise and play. As time went on, the Chinese Shar-Pei was also used in the upper classes as a fighting dog, although this practice went out of style after the Communist revolution. After the Communist revolution in China, the Shar-Pei population was nearly wiped out, and to this day it is among the rarest breeds in the world. Although the pedigree of the Shar-Pei is not exact, there are some experts that can trace the relatives of this dog to those of other breeds. For example, it is believed that the Shar-Pei shares a common ancestor with the Chow-Chow, thanks to some similar appearances including their tongues. The Great Pyrenees are considered another possible relative, as are the Tibetan Mastiffs. This gives them a lot of links with dogs in Asian history. Chinese Shar-Pei\u2019s have been bred over the years for a number of tasks. Unfortunately, dog fighting is one of the influences in this dog\u2019s past. But other tasks, such as herding animals, have influenced the modern Chinese Shar-Pei\u2019s behavior and made it a willing companion for a variety of tasks. A Chinese Shar-Pei should have a healthy and even voracious appetite at times has a relatively large frame. Good meats and poultry are considered healthy and natural foods for a dog of this type, and it\u2019s important to remember to incorporate other whole ingredients into a dog\u2019s diet so as to maintain a healthy coat and body. It\u2019s also important to remember that regular exercise should be considered part of a healthy overall daily regimen for this breed. It is generally a gentle dog and is even considered quiet when it has no other reasons to bark. The proper training and socialization of a Chinese Shar-Pei from a young age is very crucial in its development. Because it can have a higher propensity to territorial aggression and can be a little worried around strangers, it should get used to the idea of other humans and should be able to realize that being around them is safe. Training will also require a good degree of patience. If you\u2019re a first-time dog trainer, the Shar-Pei is not the ideal dog to \u201ccut your teeth\u201d on. Weighing around 55-65 pounds in males and 40-55 pounds in females, this could be considered a relatively large but still medium-sized dog. The aforementioned territorial behavior is a remnant of the Chinese Shar-Pei\u2019s role as a guard dog in years past, as well as its dog fighting history. It is generally a gentle dog in other cases, however, and is even considered quiet when it has no other reasons to bark. Because of their deep wrinkles, skin problems and infections can plague this breed, which means regular cleaning and bathing will be called for. Familial Shar-Pei Fever (FSF) is a disease named specifically for this breed, and it usually lasts for about 24 hours. These fevers can come and go in the breed. A high degree of variance in their life expectancy: a Shar-Pei can often live anywhere from 7-15 years. Like almost all dog breeds, daily exercise will be pretty important in handling your relationship with the Shar-Pei, as well as maintaining a good health regimen. The Shar-Pei enjoys a variety of exercises, as well. The Chinese Shar-Pei is actually one of the rarest breeds out there. Only recognizing this breed in 1991, the American Kennel Club describes the Shar-Pei as \u201caloof and standoffish with strangers, but devoted to his family.\u201d The coat of the Shar-Pei should be rough. Their wrinkles are a distinctive feature \u2013 as puppies they will be even more wrinkled than an adult. Regular cleaning and clipping is encouraged, but the Shar-Pei is otherwise not a very high-maintenance breed. As a puppy, a Shar-Pei will have a coat full of wrinkles that it eventually \u201cgrows\u201d in to. This will require extra attention. Additionally, Shar-Pei puppies should be properly socialized and trained from a young age.", "facts": " AKC Non-Sporting Families with children, singles, apartments, houses with/without yards Devoted, protective, independent, stubborn", "tags": "apartments, China, Chinese Shar-Pei, condos, experienced dog owners, Familial Shar-Pei Fever, lazy, skin problems, wrinkles, "}, "chinook": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/chinook/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/chinook1.jpg", "name": "Chinook", "type": "dog", "text": "A true working dog, the Chinook is strong physically and mentally. He is an intelligent fellow who does everything he can with his vocal chords to communicate with his humans. Several breed fanciers believe that they can actually communicate with each other, once the owner understands the dog\u2019s tone. If true human and canine communication can occur, this vocal dog is bound to be the one to start up a conversation. The Chinook is athletic however; if you\u2019re looking for a companion to play fetch, he is not the right choice. He will be much happier going for a morning hike in the woods or an evening run through the park. This breed is not aggressive nor is a good watchdog; he would more likely help a robber carry out your silver than bark a warning, let alone bite. To learn more about the Chinook, please keep reading. A true working dog, the Chinook is strong physically and mentally. Originating in the United States in the 1900s, the Chinook was bred for his strength and drive as a sled dog. Although still able to pull heavy loads, the Chinook is usually found hiking with his family or napping by the fireplace. The Chinook was developed by breeding a female Greenwood Husky to a male Mastiff mix. This breeding created three tawny-colored pups; one of which was kept by Walden and named Chinook. He was an incredible sled dog who turned out to be the foundation of all the Chinooks recognized today. Walden began breeding Chinook to smaller and faster females that were refined in appearance. This produced lighter and quicker dogs but distemper swept through his kennel, leaving only Chinook alive.  Chinook later died while leading Admiral Byrd\u2019s expedition to Antarctica. A neighbor of Walden\u2019s began a breeding regimen with three dogs that she had acquired from him. In 1940, the neighbor\u2019s 20 dogs were sold to the Perrys. They were instrumental to the continuation of this wonderful dog breed. High-quality, dry kibble is needed to keep a Chinook in tip-top condition. He is athletic so his food should be formulated for active dogs. This breed should not be fed a diet of wet food as it can cause dental problems such as gum disease, tooth decay and malodorous breath. Chinooks are incredibly intelligent dogs and rather quick to learn. Chinooks are incredibly intelligent dogs and rather quick to learn. They can be a bit pushy so regular and repetitive training sessions are needed. Chinooks can be very clever and they will expect to get plenty of tasty treats during training sessions. This breed can excel in many of the dog sports including obedience. They have the ability to become tremendous therapy dogs and service dogs as well. The average Chinook should weigh between 55 and 70 pounds. The Chinook has an even temperament and is gentle and loving. Because they are mellow and patient, they are great with children as well as disabled people. There isn\u2019t an aggressive bone in their bodies and are not candidates for being watchdogs or protectors however; the Chinook\u2019s size can scare off potential burglars. This breed is not known to be a barker though they do thoroughly enjoy digging. The Chinook will have your backyard looking like it was invaded by a group of giant rabbits. The holes will be large and deep enough to install a formidably sized bush! He desires constant companionship from his active family and does not do well when he is left alone for prolonged periods of time. For the most part, Chinooks are pretty healthy dogs. They are prone to certain afflictions such as Cataracts, Seizures and Hip Dysplasia. Skin allergies have also been known to occur within the breed. The average Chinook usually lives to be between 12 and 15 years of age. Every dog requires some form of exercise but the Chinook is a breed that craves it. He\u2019ll never run around the backyard catching and bringing back balls or Frisbees but he\u2019ll be a ready, willing and able jogging buddy or hiking companion. This dog will gladly stroll through the neighborhood with you on the other end of the leash or hop in the car for a trip to the pet store. With this being said, he will be thrilled to pull your kids\u2019 sleds through the snow in the winter and do so exuberantly. He\u2019ll even pull them around in their wagons in the summer. It\u2019s simply that he was not born to retrieve things and few Chinooks enjoy that tedious task. After a good exercise session, he\u2019ll be quite happy to stretch out in the kitchen while you make dinner or curl up next to you on the couch and watch TV. The Chinook is a calm companion indoors provided he does have a workout every day. The Chinook has an even temperament and is gentle and loving. The American Kennel Club writes: \u201cThe Chinook was developed in New Hampshire as a sled dog whose function was drafting and sled dog racing. Bred to combine the power of freighting breeds with the speed of the lighter racing sled dogs, he is an athletic, hard bodied dog. The Chinook, whose name means \u2018warm winter winds\u2019 in Inuit, was named New Hampshire\u2019s State Dog in 2009.\u201d The Chinook was recognized by the AKC in 2014. The Chinook has a thick double coat that is neither short nor long. It should be tawny by nature but does vary between a gentle honey color to a vibrant red gold. Darker hair tips on the tail and contrasting markings on the inside of the eyes, muzzle and ears are quite desirable in the breed. Any white is a fault according to the breed standard. If shedding were a sport, the Chinook would be an automatic champion. His dual coat sheds profusely twice each year. Daily brushing is needed to keep the dog comfortable and your vacuum free from clogging. Bathing is only needed when the dog begins to smell badly. It is essential that Chinook puppies go to puppy kindergarten classes. This will start him with the basics of training as well as giving him the opportunity to socialize with other dogs as well as other people. You must keep in mind that Chinook puppies are far and few between. It can take around two years for someone to get a puppy. For the most part, puppies are reserved years before they are even conceived.

It first originated in Mongolia before being transported and bred in China. With a distinctive appearance (its name in Mandarin approximately translates as \u201cpuffy-lion dog\u201d) full of hair and resembling a bear crossed with a dog, it\u2019s hard to miss this dog. But what is its popularity like in the United States, and can these dogs be considered friendly roommates for you and your family? As we delve deeper into the world of Chow Chows \u2013 which is really the ancient world of dog breeds itself \u2013 we\u2019ll find out more about what makes the Chow Chow such an interesting and unique breed. As it turns out, the rich history of this dog can be traced to working-class roots but the breed has risen to become more of a show dog and companion dog \u2013 or both, because when you have this breed as a companion, you\u2019ll want to show it off! Here is an overview of the breed. One of the most ancient of dog breeds, the Chow Chow \u2013 like other ancient breeds \u2013 hails from Asia. Like the Pug, another ancient breed, the Chow Chow comes from Asia. Specifically, the breed originally hails from northern China or Mongolia \u2013 and its history extends back as far as thousands of years. Even DNA analysis has confirmed that the Chow Chow is actually the oldest breed of dog in existence, its breed purity having been maintained for millennia. If that\u2019s a little intimidating for you as a new dog owner, consider that these dogs survived so well because they made such excellent companions, and even workers, although they do have more cat-like personalities, as we\u2019ll learn later one. In terms of tracing the dog\u2019s history to specific dates, there are sculptures of Chow Chow-like dogs that date to the Han Dynasty, which ran from 206 B.C. to 22 A.D. Their history even comes up through the United States, as President Calvin Coolidge owned a Chow Chow. You can\u2019t trace a pedigree of the oldest breed in the world! But it is important to remember that Chow Chow is part of the makeup of other dogs\u2019 pedigrees. According to the American Kennel Club, \u201csome scholars claim the Chow was the original ancestor of the Samoyed, Norwegian Elkhound, Pomeranian and Keeshond.\u201d Needless to say, the Chow Chow is a very northern-appearing dog, and many of its relative breeds have similar northern-like appearances. (Arctic dog breeds, for example, tend to have puffier, heavier coats.) It\u2019s not hard to imagine a breed that descends from a Chow playing in snow; in fact, it appears that the Chow is well-suited for this purpose. This makes the Chow Chow an excellent companion dog for your children\u2019s snow days and a versatile breed in general should you live in cold winter states or countries.  Considering the medium stature of Chow Chows, they still don\u2019t have to eat a whole lot, even if they appear to want to. Remember that a dog of this size will require a comparatively small diet \u2013 in other words, don\u2019t always try to feed it human meals. Nutritious, whole foods are a must-have for just about any dog, including healthy and lean meats. The Chow Chow can, at times, be a bit frustrating to train, as it has a personality that resembles that of a cat. The Chow Chow can, at times, be a bit frustrating to train, as it has a personality that resembles that of a cat. It is well-suited for domestic life, to be sure, but this can also mean that the dog feels so comfortable at home that it\u2019s not always willing to listen to what you have to say. If you maintain good discipline and don\u2019t give the dog treats for the wrong reasons, you shouldn\u2019t have a lot of trouble. Chow Chows can be deceptively heavy, weighing in the area of 45-70 pounds, with males running on the higher end of that spectrum and females on the lower end. As stated, the Chow Chow makes for a good domestic dog with a laid-back personality that is not overly aggressive or anxious when it hasn\u2019t moved around in a while. They don\u2019t have much need for exercise, unlike some dogs that are better suited for wide-open country estates. Affected by a variety of joint ailments, you can expect a Chow Chow to have a relatively high likelihood of experiencing these in its lifetime. Being sure that you acquire a healthy Chow Chow is important from the beginning, so make sure to pay scrupulous attention to detail in this regard. A lifespan of 9-15 years depending on a wide degree of variables should be expected in the Chow Chow. Chow Chows are not major exercisers; though they hail from ancient working roots, the modern Chow is a companion dog and feels perfectly at home\u2026 when it\u2019s at home. Having a Chow Chow that isn\u2019t very fond of exercise is not all that unusual. Still, discipline should be retained and you should get out and walk your Chow Chow regularly. The Chow Chow makes for a good domestic dog with a laid-back personality. According to the American Kennel Club, \u201cA powerful, sturdy dog of Arctic type, medium in size and muscular with heavy bone, the Chow Chow is an ancient breed of northern Chinese origin. While the breed was originally a working dog, he primarily serves as a companion today and is seen in show rings across the country.\u201d The distinctive, attractive coat of the Chow Chow is one of the main attractions. Puffy and large, the coat can range in color from light brown to cinnamon or cream. Regular brushing should be maintained so that the coat stays healthy and vibrant.  A Chow Chow makes for a very cute puppy, so a word of warning: your children will probably want to get one as soon as they lay eyes on a Chow Chow! It\u2019s also important when acquiring a Chow Chow puppy that you ensure they are verified as healthy. Be sure to train a Chow Chow with patience and don\u2019t over-do early on.

With a name like Cimarron Uruguayo, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that these dogs hail from Uruguay. The Cimarron Uruguayo is a breed of the molosser type that originated in Uruguay. The word \u201ccimarron\u201d means \u201cferal\u201d in Latin America, which is a clue about the dog\u2019s history. Though primarily descendant from the Alano Espanol, the early specimens of the Cimarron Uruguayo breed were largely wild, living in the highlands of Cerra Largo. During the 18th century, however, attacks on humans and livestock led to a purging of the breed with government-paid bounties for each dog. Over the years, ranchers in the highlands would capture and tame specimens of the Cimarron Uruguayo breed, using them as guard dogs. Over time, examples of the breed\u2019s ferocity and survival led to it becoming something of a national symbol in Uruguay as well as being the mascot of the National Army of Uruguay. The breed is currently recognized by the FCI and the UKC, but not yet by the AKC. The Cimarron Uruguayo is primarily descendant from the Alano Espanol and other early European dogs. As a large-breed dog, the Cimarron Uruguayo requires a high-quality diet formulated for large or giant breeds.

Males stand 23 to 24 inches tall and weigh 85 to 100 pounds while females stand 21.5 to 22.5 inches tall and weigh between 75 and 90 pounds. Though there are some examples of Cimarron Uruguayo dogs being kept as pets, they are more typically used for guarding or as a working dog. These dogs have a very high prey drive and they have a low tolerance for other dogs, so they are best kept in a single-pet household or separated from other dogs. This breed is known for its great courage and hardworking attitude, but he can be somewhat stubborn and independent at times with a tendency towards aggression. Even when properly socialized, this breed should not be trusted around other animals. No known studies of the Cimarron Uruguayo\u2019s genetic health have been conducted, but some health problems to which the breed may be prone include hypothyroidism, gastric torsion, obesity, and hip or elbow dysplasia. The average lifespan for the Cimarron Uruguayo is 10 to 13 years. The Cimarron Uruguayo is not an overly active breed, but he does have significant exercise requirements. They need at least an hour of exercise per day, ideally more, and will appreciate having a fenced yard for extra exercise.

There are two primary colors for the breed \u2013 brindle and fawn. Dogs of the brindle type are usually fawn or brown with black striping and any shade of fawn is acceptable. Cimarron Uruguayo dogs may or may not have a black mask and some white markings are permissible. The average litter size for the Cimarron Uruguayo breed is 4 to 10 puppies. Early socialization and training is extremely important for puppies of this breed but, even so, they should never be trusted alone with other animals. If you leave your puppy outside in a fenced yard, he will come to defend it as his territory, so be careful.

The Cirneco dell\u2019etna is the smallest of the hound breeds native to the Mediterranean islands.   The Cirneco dell\u2019Etna is considered an ancient breed native to the island of Sicily where its ancestors were used to hunt hare and rabbit. This breed has undergone relatively little manipulation by man so the modern breed is still similar to the ancient Cirneco dell\u2019Etna.

The Cirneco dell\u2019Etna has a short, glossy coat that is fine in texture and very easy to care for. A simple weekly brushing is typically enough to take care of loose or dead hairs. The most common colors for this breed are various shades of tan or chestnut, though some specimens exhibit a white collar or patches of white. It is important to start socializing and training this breed from a very young age to prevent the dog from developing a strong will or independent streak.

And indeed, much of the breed\u2019s early history centers around French and British nobility. Although their exact history is unclear, it is widely believed that Clumber Spaniels originated from the gun dogs bred by the French nobility in the early 1600s. One theory of origin goes onto state that the French Duc de Noailles, under threat from the French Revolution, gave away his prized kennel of hunting dogs to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park. It is believed that the breed was developed and perfected here by the Duke\u2019s gamekeeper William Mansel. However, it is certain that the breed derives its name from Clumber Park. The breed enjoyed great patronage from various British Royals, including Queen Victoria\u2019s consort Prince Albert and his son King Edward VII. Queen Victoria mentions the breed in her diary as follows: \u201cWalked out directly after breakfast before Albert went to shoot. He had his 7 fine Clumber Spaniels with us and we went into the Slopes, with such a funny old Gamekeeper, Walters, in order that I should see how the dogs found out their game. They are such dear, nice dogs.\u201d The breeding of Clumber Spaniels was restricted to British nobility up until the mid 19th century, and was halted completely during World War I. This caused their numbers to drop drastically and it took the efforts of King George V to rejuvenate the breed. It is believed that the Clumber Spaniel\u2019s ancestry includes blood from the now extinct Alpine Spaniel, the Basset Hound and the St. Bernard.

The name Cocker Spaniel rolls off the tongue and reflects the actual appearance of the Spaniel itself \u2013 a small, flowing, elegant animal that is well-balanced and has a general reputation for good behavior. But what about the Cocker Spaniel makes it such a quintessential dog? Like many breeds, the Cocker Spaniel has a rich history updated into a modern appearance, but the Spaniel is not as old as even the Rottweiler. In this brief guide, we\u2019ll take a look at the Cocker Spaniel and address how it became a breed synonymous with \u201cquality dog.\u201d The Cocker Spaniel is small, flowing, and elegant, and has a general reputation for good behavior. The mention of \u201cSpanyells\u201d goes back as far as the Middle Ages \u2013 the 14th century, to be exact. There\u2019s a good chance these Spanyells weren\u2019t exactly the Cocker Spaniels we know today, but this specific breed of dog has certainly enjoyed a rich history. It\u2019s assumed Spaniels first appeared in Spain during this time, but the first appearance of the phrase \u201cCocker Spaniel\u201d didn\u2019t originate until the 1800s, when a specific type of field spaniel began assuming the name. At the time, in England, the phrase Cocker Spaniel could also refer to a number of other spaniels such as the Norfolk and Sussex Spaniels, which today could be considered different breeds. This general classification gave rise to a low standard of calling a dog a Cocker Spaniel: until around 1870, the only characteristic a dog named a \u201cCocker Spaniel\u201d had to have was a weight of under 25 pounds. Needless to say, the standards have risen, but the story helps illustrate why the phrase \u201cCocker Spaniel\u201d seems to associate itself with any manner of small dogs. Cocker Spaniels were considered hounds hundreds of years ago, and as such were often used to assist with hunting, as many dogs at the time were. Since Cocker Spaniels helped hunt Woodcock, you find the name \u201cCocker.\u201d Cocker Spaniels have actually been pedigree to many other dogs as classifications have grown more sophisticated. The aforementioned Norfolk and Sussex Spaniels were initially considered Cocker Spaniels, as were Welsh Springer Spaniels, formerly known as Welsh Cocker Spaniels. Today, there is a stark difference in the appearance of the American Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker Spaniel. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about Cocker Spaniels, it\u2019s a good idea to view these animals as different breeds. Small but active, Cocker Spaniels typically have a relatively fast metabolism and should be fed with that in mind. But it\u2019s also important to keep in mind that these animals are small. Spaniels might try to feast on birds when left to its own devices, but you\u2019ll find that meat mixed in with general dog food and vegetables can make for a very nutritious Spaniel meal. Excitable but well-balanced, Cocker Spaniels are a well-behaved small dog that have a lot of energy. Training a Cocker Spaniel is not a special challenge, although smaller dogs in general can be a little harder to control and be easy to distract, especially considering how difficult they can be to gather if they decide to dart off. A Cocker Spaniel is speedy and you\u2019ll want to incorporate that into both your exercise and training \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid to give your Cocker Spaniel a job that might work for a sporting dog. Cocker Spaniels, after all, are considered part of the sporting group, even if they are the group\u2019s smallest member. As mentioned, until around 1870 any dog less than 25 pounds was considered a Cocker Spaniel. These days, a Cocker Spaniel might not deviate too far from that, depending on the individual gender of the Cocker Spaniel. Cocker Spaniels should be light and ready to move. If your Cocker Spaniel is anything but quick at a relatively young age, it is probably overweight. Excitable but well-balanced, Cocker Spaniels are a well-behaved small dog that have a lot of energy, particularly when they\u2019re young. They\u2019re friendly enough to be one of the most popular breeds of dog in America and can take very well to company, particularly if they\u2019ve formed bonds with certain people. These Spaniels are not a toy dog and enjoy having something to do, so treat them as a sporting dog even if you keep them groomed like a toy breed. Unfortunately, Cocker Spaniels can be susceptible to a number of health problems, and this isn\u2019t always good news for owners who want a dog to last more than a decade. The breed is susceptible to eye and ear problems. Otitis externa comes about in the Cocker Spaniel\u2019s ear as a result of the warm, unaired area under the ear where organisms enjoy growing. Progressive retinal atrophy, which leads to blindness, is also an issue for this dog, as is Canine Glaucoma. You can expect a relatively healthy and normal Cocker Spaniel to live approximately 10-12 years depending on a few conditions. English Cocker Spaniels tend to live a year longer than American Cocker Spaniels on average. Cocker Spaniels should be walked daily and require a good amount of exercise to tire, especially as young puppies. Cocker Spaniels will drink plenty of water and usually have a good metabolism, ensuring a healthy appetite for their size. If you want to have a good time with your Cocker Spaniel, an open (but safe) area such as a park can make an ideal place \u2013 Cocker Spaniels can cover a lot of space and have good agility. A merry, well-balanced dog that is capable of considerable speed and great endurance. The American Kennel Club describes the Cocker Spaniel as a \u201cmerry, well-balanced dog that is capable of considerable speed and great endurance.\u201d Cocker Spaniel coats can be rich and thick, which requires fairly regular brushing and trimming. The coat can also run the gamut of colors from black to\u2026 well, just about anything you\u2019d expect to see in a dog. Cocker Spaniel puppies can be very cute and fully of energy, but measures should be taken to ensure they\u2019re raised with the right expectations of behavior. They have a generally high tolerance for exercise, but over exercise is always discouraged for growing dogs.

Most people who hear the word \u201cRetriever\u201d instantly picture a Golden or a Labrador but the Curly, he\u2019s in a league of his own. His tight, little curls of the body combines with the short coat on the face and lower legs give the Curly-Coated Retriever a look that is quite distinct from another breed. This is a multiple-purpose dog that is happy running in the fields, retrieving in the water or lounging on the couch. Curly owners not only love their versatility but also adore their gentle and loving natures. Although they are large dogs, the Curly-Coated Retriever is graceful and elegant. Because of all of these wonderful attributes, the Curly is a great dog for any family. To learn more about this loyal breed, please continue reading. The Curly-Coated Retriever is a multiple-purpose dog that is happy running in the fields, retrieving in the water or lounging on the couch. The true origin of the Curly-Coated Retriever is undocumented however the AKC suggests that it originated in England. It is believed to be the oldest breed of all the retrievers. In England, the Curly was a much-favored dog for his hunting prowess and incredible agility by gamekeepers. It is believed that the Curly-Coated Retriever was derived by combining a variety of breeds. Many support the suggestion that the Old English Water Spaniel, which is now extinct, and the old style Retrieving Setter were incorporated to create this breed. Of course, other breeds would have been introduced, such as the St. John\u2019s Newfoundland Dog, the Labrador Retriever, the Irish Water Spaniel, the Pointer and/or the Poodle. These contributors created the great dog that is now known as the Curly-Coated Retriever. Because of his high-energy and athleticism, the Curly-Coated Retriever needs a good quality diet specifically formulated for active dogs. It is best to feed dry food as it will help to eliminate plaque buildup on the teeth which can cause inflamed gums, tooth decay and smelly breath. The Curly should never be fed one large meal. Meals should be split into a morning meal and an evening meal to help prevent canine bloat, a potentially fatal problem. Free feeding is an option provided the dog does not overeat and become overweight. Curly-Coated Retrievers grow to become large dogs so it is essential that you start training when they are puppies. Curly-Coated Retrievers grow to become large dogs so it is essential that you start training when they are puppies. It is also important that you keep in mind that because they are such great Retrievers, they tend to mouthy and chew things up as pups. This unwanted behavior must be nipped in the bud at an early age.  The Curly is highly trainable and responds well to repetitive training sessions along with positive reinforcement. His willingness to please makes the Curly-Coated Retriever the perfect candidate for AKC Sanctioned Obedience Trials. Owners who plan to use their Curly-Coated Retrievers for hunting purposes should acclimate the pup to water as soon as possible. This doesn\u2019t mean that a ten week old puppy should go into icy water in the freezing cold. It\u2019s best to buy a plastic wading pool and fill it with water on a mild day. More than likely, the pup will find his way in and have a grand, old time. A retrieving dummy will make his first experience in the water a good one. A male Curly-Coated Retriever typically should weigh in somewhere between 80 and 100 pounds while a female Curly should weigh between 65 and 85 pounds. Many people consider that the reserved nature and tendency to evaluate strangers before approaching them as timidity. Nothing is further than the truth. Although the Curly is a retriever, he is not as overbearing as many of the others. Early socialization with different people, sights, sounds and situations will ensure that your dog is accepting of strangers. There are some people who take the Curly-Coated Retriever\u2019s high energy as hyperactivity, which is incorrect. A Curly that has enough exercise will be happy to relax inside of the house. Lack of adequate exercise could cause him to become unruly indoors. By taking half an hour out of your day to play with the dog, he will get the exercise he needs and you will probably become healthier too. Curlies are slow to mature so they are in the puppy stages longer than many others. You should be aware and prepared to deal with a very large puppy before making a decision. Bear in mind that a Curly will bore easily so a plethora of interesting toys will be necessary. He will also be strong-willed so training and an owner who has the confidence to train him is essential to having a happy life together. There isn\u2019t a dog breed known to man that doesn\u2019t have a propensity for one health problem or another. Because the Curly is a large breed, there are problems with hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia. It is important for Curly owners to understand that hip dysplasia can also be caused by his environment. Situations that cause a puppy to be diagnosed with hip dysplasia include quick weight gain, playing on tile floors and injuries from jumping on or off furniture. Curlies are prone to a variety of eye issues including Entropion, Ectropion, Persistent Pupillary Membranes, Progressive Retinal Atrophy, Distichiasis and Retinal Dysplasia. The metabolic issue known as Glycogen Storage Disease has been seen all too often in the breed. Numerous cancers have also been prevalent in Curly-Coated Retrievers such as Lymphosarcoma, Adenocarcinoma, Fibrosarcoma, Hemangiosarcoma, Melanoma, Osteosarcoma and Mast Cell Tumors. Pattern Baldness is also a problem but it does not create a health issue provided the owner ensures that the dog wears sunscreen when he goes outdoors. Bloat, also known as Gastric Dilation Volvulus can be a problem; Curlies have less of a tendency for this deadly problem when meals are split or they are free fed throughout the day. The average lifespan of a Curly-Coated Retriever is between 8 and 12 years. As a highly athletic dog, the Curly-Coated Retriever craves exercise. A quick walk is not going to do it for this bundle of energy! A Curly needs a big, fenced backyard in which to run and burn off his energy, which is why he is a great candidate for the companion of an active family. The Curly is wonderful with kids. But because of his large size, he might knock smaller children down. He will be a great and grateful asset to those seeking a waterfowl hunting buddy but would also like his dog to be a trusted and loving family member. The AKC Breed Standard for the Curly states: \u201cSelf-confident, steadfast and proud, this active, intelligent dog is a charming and gentle family companion and a determined, durable hunter\u201d. In 1924, the very first Curly-Coated Retriever was registered with the AKC. That Curly\u2019s name was Knysna Conjurer.  Early socialization with different people, sights, sounds and situations will ensure that your dog is accepting of strangers. With a wonderfully unique coat, the Curly-Coated Retriever is distinctive from others. The body is covered in tight curls from tail to the occipital bone (prominent bone at the top of the head). These water-resistant curls travel down the legs and stop at the hocks. The remainder of the dog\u2019s legs, face and frontal portion of the head have a short coat. The coat should be liver or black in color. Many Curlies have a few white hairs or a white patch on the chest. The Curly-Coated Retriever has a low maintenance grooming schedule. Shedding is not excessive and usually occurs twice in a year. Beneath the tail and underbelly should be neatly trimmed. Of course, bathing is necessary but should not be done excessively. Everybody loves puppies and Curly puppies are absolutely precious however; they do take a lot of time and effort to raise them properly. You must socialize your Curly pup as soon as he has had his first series of vaccinations. Training should also begin as soon as the puppy is acclimated to his new home. Training is essential to making your new family member and happy, healthy and well-adjusted addition to your home.

This breed is the result of an experiment in 1955 that involved crossing 48 working line German Shepherds with Carpathian wolves. The idea behind creating the Czech Wolf Dog was to create a powerful breed with the trainability, temperament and pack mentality of the German Shepherd as well as the strength and endurance of the Carpathian Wolf. Although first used by the Czech Special Forces in special military operations, the breed has since been used successfully in search and rescue, tracking, herding, agility, hunting, obedience and drafting. The Czech Wolf Dog, like it name indicates, looks more like a wolf than it does a dog. Its body is lithe and powerful with long feet and a strong back. Its head too is like that of a wolf and its powerful teeth meet in a razor sharp bite. The dog\u2019s chest is large and flat and its stomach is strong and drawn in. The Czech Wolf Dog\u2019s coat too is reminiscent of that of the Carpathian Wolf and is short, thick and is yellow-grey or silvery-grey in color. The Czechoslovakian Vlcak is calm, self-assured and intelligent. It is extremely brave and protective over its masters but will rarely attack without cause or command. However, they do require a great deal of leadership and handling skills and are not recommended for beginner dog owners. The Czechoslovakian Vlcak or Czech Wolf Dog is a relatively new breed of dog first bred as a military attack dog. The story of the Czech Wolf dog starts in 1955 in the former USSR with a crossing of 48 German Shepherds to Carpathian Wolves. The military scientists that conducted these breeding experiments learned that the offspring of these crossings consistently carried the desired genetic traits of both parents, warranting a further continuation of the experiment, resulting ultimately in an organized breeding effort in 1965. In 1982 the resulting breed was recognized as Czechoslovakia\u2019s national dog. The first Czechoslovakian Vlcak was created by crossing both male and female German Shepherds with male and female Carpathian Wolves. Czech Wolf Dogs are big animals and require a well-balanced diet with high levels of nutrients and proteins. Although highly intelligent, Czech Wolf Dogs are not the easiest dogs to train. Although highly intelligent, Czech Wolf Dogs are not the easiest dogs to train. The key in training this dog lies in finding motivators that can drive the dog towards desired behaviors. They can often get bored with repetitive training techniques and can lose interest in the training effort. It is also important that trainers are extremely experienced and know how to display affectionate but firm leadership over these dogs. Although a big animal, the Czechoslovakian Vlcak is slim and only weighs in at around 54 pounds. Czech Wolf Dogs are as intelligent as they are strong and make excellent companions for the right dog owner. Once an owner is able to display strong and consistent leadership and dominance over his charge, a Czechoslovakian Vlcak will make a loving and devoted companion for life and will willingly risk its life to protect its master. Although alert and watchful, these dogs rarely attack without cause and make excellent guard dogs. Once they form a strong bond with their human handlers, Czechoslovakian Vlcaks are often very affectionate and playful although reserved around strangers. They are also affectionate towards children. They can however be aggressive towards other dogs if not given strong leadership. It is also extremely important to keep their hunting instincts in check as this can be dangerous around other smaller animals. Czech Wolf Dogs also have a varied range of expressions other than barking, like whining and shallow growls, which is why an experienced dog handler is essential. The Czechoslovakian Vlcak is a generally healthy and hardy breed and do not suffer from any major hereditary health issues. They can however suffer from hip dysplasia on occasion, but this is common in dogs of this size. Czech Wolf Dogs often enjoy extremely long life spans and can life for up to 16 years. Czech Wolf Dogs require daily rigorous exercise and a short walk each day will not cut it for these dogs. Owners should be prepared to devote at least 2 hours each day to exercise their Czech Wolf Dogs and drain their excess energy. Like all intelligent dog breeds, these dogs are at their happiest when they are given a \u201cmeaningful\u201d job to which they can devote themselves to. Czech Wolf Dogs are as intelligent as they are strong and make excellent companions for the right dog owner. The Czechoslovakian Vlcak is included in the American Kennel Club\u2019s Foundation Stock Service. The Czech Wolf Dog\u2019s wolf-like coat only needs to be brushed and washed occasionally.

If you\u2019re looking for a breed with the temperament and trainability of the German Shepherd but the stamina and appearance of a Carpathian wolf, this is the breed for you. The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog was bred for he Czechoslovak Special Forces as an attack dog but has come to be used for search and rescue. The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog was originally bred from a German Shepherd and a Carpathian wolf with the first litter being born in 1958. The puppies from this initial crossing resembled the wolf in both appearance and behavior which meant that, while training was possible, the upbringing was difficult. Subsequent crossings involved more of the German Shepherd side which yielded a more dog-like hybrid that still exhibited the stronger night vision, hearing, and navigational skills of the wolf. The last time actual wolf blood was used in the crossing was in 1983 and in 1989, the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog was provisionally recognized by the FCI \u2013 it was officially recognized ten years later. Today, there are close to 300 specimens of the breed in existence, most of which are registered in Italy and the Czech Republic. The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is the result of an experimental crossing between a German Shepherd and a Carpathian Wolf conducted by Ing. Karel Hartl in 1955. As a medium to large-breed dog, the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog should be fed a high-quality dry food formulated for larger breeds.

These dogs are lively, playful dogs and they are extremely social \u2013 they bond closely with their families and they adapt easily to life with other pets. They can, however, be aggressive toward unfamiliar animals and may chase small pets they have not been raised with. In terms of their ability to get along with children, Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs are playful and friendly. When it comes to strangers, this breed can be a little suspicious and some of them are a little dog-aggressive, though they are not inherently volatile. With his wild heritage, the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is not known to be affected by any specific health problems. Because he is a larger breed, however, he may be prone to musculoskeletal issues like hip dysplasia and may also be prone to bloat. The average lifespan for the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is thought to be about 12 to 15 years. The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is a highly active dog that requires a lot of daily exercise. This breed needs a long walk at least once a day and will also appreciate having an outdoor space in which to run.

Known for its long, stretched-out appearance and short legs, there are three types of Dachshunds: long-haired, wired-haired and short-haired. The only difference between the three is size and coat description; the distinct build is the same in any of the types. Boasting a regal and intelligent expression on its face, the Dachshund has a long head with protruding and arched eyebrows, a long muzzle with a scissor bite and very strong teeth. Its eyes are either brownish black or deep red. Another distinguishing characteristic is its long ears that are soft to the touch. If you\u2019re looking for a happy addition to your family, you can\u2019t go wrong with a Dachshund \u2013 it always has a friendly look on its face. Read on to learn more about the breed. You may know it as the \u201cWeiner Dog,\u201d but its actual breed name is Dachshund. The Dachshund can trace its origins hundreds of years ago to Germany. Some sources place the origin of the breed as far as the 15th century, but a more likelier number is late 17th to early 18th century, when first concrete mentions of a dachshund-like breed can be found. Books from that era describe certain dogs named \u201cDachs Kriecher\u201d (meaning \u201cbadger crawler\u201d) or \u201cDachs Krieger\u201d (\u201cbadger warrior\u201d), and it is largely believed that this is when the Dachshund breed was actually developed as such- the previous mentions were more general and referred to all types of dogs fulfilling the role of badger hunting rather than a specific breed. Bred to track and hunt badgers, this breed was developed with the specific sport in mind. The Dachshund was engineered for this hunting activity and it is directly reflected through its unique body shape. Its short legs let it burrow deep into the badgers\u2019 dens and its long, sturdy tail gave the hunters a \u201chandle\u201d they could pull to retrieve the burrowing dog out from the den. As well, its large and paddle-shaped paws made digging efficient and its loose skin ensured it wouldn\u2019t tear as the dog tunneled into tight burrows. The smaller Dachshunds were used to hunt hare and rabbits, while the larger ones caught smaller animals like otters and foxes. Interestingly, the smooth-haired type of Dachshund is believed to be the oldest of the tree, with the wiry and long-haired variants being developed later in the breed\u2019s history.  While originally developed to be used for hunting, in the 1800s, Dachshunds moved from hunters to cherished and pampered pets. It is then when the dogs were bred to be smaller in size- the Dachshunds became about 10 pounds lighter in this transition. Not unlike most small dogs in that period, Dachshunds were beloved lap dogs of ladies and nobles, and started enjoying all of the perks that came with their new status. Similarly, the breed was then bred and selected for other traits that would make it more appealing in its new role, such as playfulness, affection, and friendliness rather than a prey drive- which, truthfully, did survive in the breed to this day in some form (it\u2019s mostly the garden beds that bear the brunt of it).  Dachshunds may share the behavior and appearance of a terrier, but in actuality, the breed belongs to the hound group of dogs. Since the Dachshunds were originally bred to trail and hunt animals, they probably descended from scent hounds, such as Bloodhounds, Pointers and Basset Hounds. But since the Dachshunds love to dig, it can be argued that they belong in the terrier group- it all depends on which way you look at it. As for the experts, most official canine organizations in the world have recognized the Dachshund as a distinct breed.  The Dachshund was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885. The AKC says about the breed that \u201cthe famously long, low silhouette, ever-alert expression, and bold, vivacious personality of the Dachshund have made him a superstar of the canine kingdom\u201d and it\u2019s hard not to agree- Wiener dogs are truly superstars in every sense of the word. In addition to the American Kennel Club, the Dachshund is also recognized by the FCI, The Kennel Club, and The United Kennel Club, to name a few. Because the Dachshund is prone to obesity, you should watch its food intake carefully. Don\u2019t let it free feed or overeat. Every tip of the scale towards a higher number means additional strain on the Dachshund\u2019s petite body and thanks to its unique build, it could mean serious problems with the spine down the road- not to mention universal risks such as diabetes or heart issues. Most Dachshunds do well on a diet consisting mainly from high-quality dry dog food. When choosing kibble for your pet, make sure that it\u2019s appropriate for their activity level and age and made from natural ingredients.  If you\u2019re looking for a happy addition to your family, you can\u2019t go wrong with a Dachshund. Although the Dachshund is not a difficult dog to train, you will need firmness and consistency to make the lessons stick. Once properly trained, the breed makes a great companion and family dog. Since this breed is so loyal, training strengthens the bond. Start training early in order to eliminate habits such as excessive digging and barking. It\u2019s important to note that Dachshunds believe it is the alpha in the family, so you need to show this dog who is the boss. If not disciplined, the Dachshund can become stubborn, but always reward training with high praise. If a Dachshund gets bored, it will turn to destructive behavior. Always leave them with constructive toys so it always has something to do. As well, crate training works well for housebreaking this dog. Both male and female Dachshunds can weight anywhere from nine to 20 pounds. Because it is smaller dog, take care that your dog doesn\u2019t become overweight \u2013 it can become too much for its little legs to handle. A lively and affectionate dog, the Dachshund has a bold personality. Even though it is friendly, the Dachshund can be willful when it wants something (you\u2019ll see this side come out during training). Many believe the long-haired version is the calmest of the three varieties, while the wire-haired is more jovial and funny. The breed gets along better with older children and older, calmer dogs, but it does get jealous of other dogs and may snap at them if bothered.  Dachshunds like to bark, and its bark is a surprisingly loud one for a dog that small. It loves to dig, and are good workers with plenty of energy and stamina. Dachshunds love being with its owners and make great family dogs. An overall healthy dog, the Dachshund is prone to certain health problems. One is problem with its spinal disc, which can cause paralysis. To prevent this injury, ensure that your Dachshund doesn\u2019t jump from high heights. Other problems that may present include urinary tract problems, heart disease and diabetes. Make sure your Dachshund gets plenty of exercise to prevent an overweight dog. Dachshunds have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years. Even though the Dachshund has high energy, it doesn\u2019t mean this dog doesn\u2019t enjoy being lazy. Add to that its love of food, and you could have an obese dog on your hands. One of the great things about having a small dog is that it can get its exercise indoors as well as out. Dachshunds like going for walks and playing catch. Due to its short legs, this dog isn\u2019t a great runner. As it gets older, your Dachshund will exercise less on its own, so it\u2019s up to you to get this dog going. Once properly trained, the Dachshund makes a great companion and family dog. The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cThe Dachshund, meaning \u201cbadger dog\u201d in German, is a lively breed with a friendly personality and keen sense of smell. Known for their long and low bodies, they are eager hunters that excel in both above- and below-ground work.\u201d The Dachshund has three different coat varieties: short coated, wirehaired and long coated. The short-coated Dachshund has glossy smooth fur. The wire haired has a rougher outer coat with a softer, thinner undercoat as well as eyebrow and a beard. The long haired variety has wavy hair, with long hair on its tail. Dachshunds come in a variety of colors. Colors include yellow or tan solid coats, bi-colored coats of gray, black or brown with chestnut, speckle streaked or piebald, and a solid background with dark stripes.  Be sure to socialize your Dachshund puppy with your family and other animals.

Often associated as the kind of dogs who help firemen and police, Dalmatians are notoriously good workers and comprise an assertive, friendly breed. And as the only spotted breed of dog, they\u2019re not exactly hard to spot. But what is it about Dalmatians that seems to capture our imaginations? Was it the movie? Or is it simply the spirit of the breed? After all, if you\u2019re considering buying a dog for you family, you may find that nothing can light up your children\u2019s eyes quite like mentioning a Dalmatian. What are the right circumstances for a Dalmatian? As you\u2019re about to find out, Dalmatians are an active breed that enjoy attention and love to get in a good workout \u2013 especially if there\u2019s company involved. If you\u2019re considering getting a Dalmatian yourself, here are some facts that can help you better understand this unique breed of dog. As the only spotted breed of dog, they\u2019re not exactly hard to spot. Considering they\u2019re called Dalmatians, one might think they\u2019re from a made-up, far-away place like Dalmatia. Silly, right? Well, that\u2019s the case \u2013 except Dalmatia is not made-up. It\u2019s a region in the country of Croatia, and historians pinpoint the Dalmatians there back to the late 1700s. Although that is the official country of origin, the Dalmatian is actually quite an English dog, having been developed and bred primarily in England. The truth is that there\u2019s not a lot know about the Dalmatian breed. Dalmatians were said to be from Croatia in the mid-1800s, as is officially known now, and were said to be used as guard dogs. Thanks to a sporty, active English breeding, Dalmatians are now known as dogs that get along with a variety of animals \u2013 especially the horse \u2013 and display strong hunting and sporting instincts. There is little precedent for establishing the pedigree of Dalmatians, although some people in Croatia will tell you that they descend from guard dogs and dogs of war in the Dalmatia region. Modern-day Dalmatians trace their instincts and breeding to England, where Dalmatians were bred to work with carriages. This explains the Dalmatian\u2019s instinct to follow horses whenever they are seen. Dalmatians currently are used frequently in firefighting thanks to its strong instincts and assertive nature as well as a healthy response to habitual training. Dalmatians do not have many stringent needs when it comes to their diet. As avid exercisers, this breed can work up an appetite but should be fed accordingly in order to create a lean, healthy look. Dalmatians should not be fed processed foods or foods meant for human consumption. Dalmatians have plenty of endurance and stamina. Because Dalmatians are frequently used in fire fighting, there\u2019s no doubt about its responsiveness to training. A good trainer can get a Dalmatian to act well-behaved and assertive but never overly-aggressive. Like many assertive animals, a Dalmatian can generally be more assertive in the presence of a weak or submissive trainer or dog owner. For this reason it\u2019s especially important to be assertive and in command around a Dalmatian. This dog breed that understands its role can get along very well with other animals in your home. Dalmatians are relatively tall but also lean \u2013 they should be somewhere around 55 pounds. Deviating too far from the norm (either over or underweight) can cause health problems down the line. A dog with plenty of activity and good healthy food readily available should have no problems maintaining a healthy weight. Male Dalmatians can be heavier than females. Dalmatians are very active.

This determined terrier would hunt otters and badgers, and \u201cgo to ground\u201d to hunt these vermin in their underground dens. It wasn\u2019t until 1814 when these dogs finally got their name (all of these types of dogs were called terriers). The name is taken from Sir Walter Scott\u2019s book Guy Mannering. Scott owned a number of Dandies and included them in his book.

And where did this breed come from? Like some other tough breeds such as the German Shepherd, the Doberman Pinscher comes from Germany and has its closest roots tied to 19th-century life. The Doberman was named for a man called Louis Dobermann who originally bred the animals. And what was Dobermann\u2019s profession? Tax collecting\u2026 that\u2019s all you need to know about his need for protection. Since he had access to a number of dog breeds, Dobermann set about breeding a dog that would make a loyal companion and excellent guardian. It\u2019s no surprise that this deliberate breeding led to the quality dog we now know as the Doberman Pinscher. Its guardian instincts and loyal companionship remain well in tact here in the 21st century and it\u2019s not a surprise that the Doberman Pinscher has become one of the most popular and recognizable breeds across the world.

The breed was created in the late 1920s by the Argentinean surgeon Antonio Nores Mart\u00ednez who wanted to create a breed that was brave and strong enough to hunt big game like wild boar and puma, but also manageable and fiercely protective of its human owners. Since then, the Dogos have carved out a special niche in Argentinean culture and have even had a statue erected in their honor. Dogo Argentinos have powerfully built well-muscled bodies. Their large heads are equipped with extremely powerful jaws designed to bite and hold on to large prey. Their necks have an abundance of skin designed to protect their necks when hunting dangerous game. The Dogo\u2019s coat is pure white and any colored markings are considered a fault. Despite their imposing appearance, Dogos are in fact extremely gentle and loving. They are highly devoted to their masters and will willingly risk their lives to protect their human owners. Unfortunately, they are banned in certain countries like Ukraine, Iceland, Australia and Singapore. The Dogo Argentino, also known as the Argentinean Mastiff or Argentine Dogo, is the canine equivalent of an armored tank. The Dogo Argentino was created by the Argentine breeder Mr. Antonio Nores Martinez. The goal in creating the Dogo was to create a dog that was a powerful and effective pack hunter as well as a wonderful companion. In his quest to create a versatile hunting dog, the Dogo Argentino\u2019s creator Antonio Nores Martinez started off with the now extinct Fighting Dog of Cordoba. The line was also crossed to a wide array of breeds including the Great Dane, the Boxer, the Spanish Mastiff, the Old English Bulldog, the Bull Terrier, the Great Pyrenees, the Pointer, the Irish Wolfhound and the Dogue de Bordeaux. Dogo Argentinos are large dogs and should be fed two wholesome meals of high-quality dry food or canned/raw foods. Since the Dogo Argentino was created to be a pack hunting dog, obedience was an important trait that was selectively bred into the breed. Since the Dogo Argentino was created to be a pack hunting dog, obedience was an important trait that was selectively bred into the breed. Therefore they are highly responsive to training efforts, provided that they are handled with firm but loving leadership. It should be noted that Dogo Argentino\u2019s aren\u2019t for meek or beginner dog owners as they can be a handful if not given proper leadership. Dogo Argentinos weigh in at a hefty 88 to 120 pounds. Despite their fearsome appearance, Dogo Argentinos are actually a very loving breed of dog and overly aggressive traits have been selectively eliminated from the breed during the course of its creation. They are also highly loyal and protective of their human pack. For example, Morocho, a Dogo Argentino belonging to Ulises Martinez, the grandson of Antonio Martinez, heroically took on a puma to protect Ulises\u2019 daughter when she was attacked by the big cat while plucking figs. Morocho was grievously injured in the fight but managed to kill the puma, save Ulises\u2019 daughter\u2019s life, and survive against all odds; a shining tribute to the success of Antonio Martinez\u2019 breeding efforts. Dogo Argentinos also get along extremely well with other dogs and thrive when raised in a pack environment. However, it is important to socialize them early with other dogs and animals to ensure that they do not turn aggressive towards them later on in life. It is also important to provide the Dogo Argentino with rules, boundaries and limitations with a calm but assertive leadership style as this dog can try to become the pack leader when faced with a meek or submissive owner. Dogo Argentinos surprisingly do not suffer from the various joint ailments that plague other large breeds. However, they do sometimes suffer from pigment-related deafness. Dogo Argentinos have a lifespan of 10 to 12 years. Dogo Argentinos are highly energetic dogs and are unsuitable for owners that cannot provide them with daily, rigorous exercise. They are able to navigate various types of terrain and make excellent jogging partners. As a working breed of dog, they are also at their happiest when given a \u2018meaningful\u2019 task which they can devote themselves to. Despite their fearsome appearance, Dogo Argentinos are actually a very loving breed of dog. The AKC has this to say about the Dogo: \u201cThe Dogo Argentino is a pack-hunting dog, bred for the pursuit of big-game such as wild boar and puma, and possesses the strength, intelligence and quick responsiveness of a serious athlete. His short, plain and smooth coat is completely white, but a dark patch near the eye is permitted as long as it doesn\u2019t cover more than 10% of the head.\u201d The Dogo Argentino is not yet recognized by the American Kennel Club. The Dogo Argentino\u2019s coat is soft to the touch and is relatively easy to groom. They have no doggy odor and are average shedders. It is crucial that Dogo Argentino puppies be socialized with humans and other animals at a very young age. Their training too should begin as early on in life as possible.", "facts": " Miscellaneous Class Families with children, houses with yards, farms/rural areas houses Intelligent, loyal, protective, friendly", "tags": "Argentina, Argentine Dogo, Argentinean Mastiff, banned dogs, deafness, Dogo Argentino, loving breed, loyal, pack hunting dog, protective, "}, "dogue de bordeaux": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/dogues-de-bordeaux", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dogues-de-bordeaux.jpg", "name": "Dogue de Bordeaux", "type": "dog", "text": "An ideal guard dog for anyone with experience in handling and training dogs, the Dogue de Bordeaux \u2013 also known as the French Mastiff or the Bordeaux Bulldog \u2013 has the versatility of being a strong, fearless guard but also having gentleness around the house, including with children. Like other guard dogs, it will need to be raised in a way that socializes it with other dogs and with people so that it understands who represents a real threat and who does not. As a large dog, it can be intimidating for some, especially children, but generally the personality of this dog is very calm provided it doesn\u2019t feel anyone is infringing on the household. Teaching the dog to be relaxed around strangers you welcome will be important, and you just may find that this unique, heavy dog becomes a neighborhood hit. And you\u2019ll definitely feel safe with a Dogue de Bordeaux in your presence \u2013 so that\u2019s not an issue. When many people imagine French dogs, the Dogue de Bordeaux is not what they have in mind. But when it comes to the breed you\u2019re interested in, this might be exactly what you had in mind. Let\u2019s learn more about this \u201cBordeaux Bulldog.\u201d The Dogue de Bordeaux has the versatility of being a strong, fearless guard but also having gentleness around the house.  The translation of Dogue de Bordeaux could perhaps be described as \u201cBordeaux Mastiff,\u201d but it is also known as a French Mastiff in areas outside of the country, particularly in America. As for its historical origins, the translations are not so clear. Many think the Dogue de Bordeaux could have descended from the Tibetan Mastiff and the Bulldog \u2013 which would certainly make the nickname \u201cBordeaux Bulldog\u201d more appropriate. Dogs in the Middle Ages in the Aquitaine region may have also been ancestors to the modern Dogue de Bordeaux, and by the end of the Middle Ages, its use as a companion and guard dog was more frequent. Although the Dogue de Bordeaux took a heavy hit during the French Revolution, it regained its numbers throughout the years and a man named Raymond Triquet helped it to survive by taking the breed under his wing. The dog\u2019s very tough history includes use in war, guardianship, and even training in hunting large game like bears, bulls, and jaguars. It was only recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2008. The pedigree is a bit difficult to decipher with the Dogue de Bordeaux, which is not uncommon for breeds that date back to the Middle Ages. As mentioned, breeds like the Bulldog and the Tibetan Mastiff might have had a hand in developing the Dogue de Bordeaux. Other breeds near the Aquitaine region in the Middle Ages, such as Spanish dogs from places like Burgos, would have undoubtedly played a role in this breed\u2019s development. An exceptionally large and heavy dog, this breed requires a similarly large diet, with normal monitoring of weight fluctuations like any other dog. This dog, however, does not require an exceptionally large diet because it\u2019s not a very vigorous exerciser. Calm leadership that places clear boundaries on the Dogue de Bordeaux will be important. Like all large dogs, training with the Dogue de Bordeaux should be handled with care. You will undoubtedly notice the fierce guardian instincts in this dog, and you\u2019ll feel quite safe in its presence, but care should be taken so that the dog does not become suspicious of all strangers and all other dogs. Calm leadership that places clear boundaries on the Dogue de Bordeaux will be important, as will ensuring a pecking order that includes the dog in the family, but makes sure the dog understands its place below every human. Weighing up to 145 pounds, this is not the type of dog you\u2019ll be able to shrug off very easily. Luckily, the personality of the Dogue de Bordeaux is not overly aggressive to its owners if properly raised. This is an ideal guard dog because it is fearless and ferocious against intruders but can be calm and friendly with every member of the household, including children. Though anyone with a large dog will have to be wary about its relationship with children, the Dogue de Bordeaux is not considered an especially high-risk dog for dealing with them. Like all dogs, clear leadership must take place on your part if they\u2019re going to have a healthy understanding of their role in your household. These are generally \u201cindoor\u201d dogs that are perfectly happy without a huge country estate to roam around in. Hip dysplasia, a frequent joint issue in larger dogs, will obviously be a problem, as are a few other issues such as heart problems and even epilepsy. A life expectancy of around 10-12 years is not unusual for a dog of this size. This being a larger dog, a long walk will be required to ensure it gets its daily exercise, but the importance of exercise is also an emphasis on its psychological benefits. This is especially important to this breed so that it doesn\u2019t store any pent up energy. Since this is a dog that sometimes forgets its own strength and weight, making sure it is good tired out will be essential to keeping it healthy and happy around the house. This is an ideal guard dog because it is fearless and ferocious against intruders but can be calm and friendly with every member of the household. Only recognizing the breed in 2008, the American Kennel Club says: \u201cA powerful and muscular French breed, the Dogue de Bordeaux is a molossoid (mastiff-type dog), \u201cdogue\u201d meaning Mastiff in French. A massive head and stocky body are trademarks of the breed. Americans were introduced to the Dogue de Bordeaux when he appeared as drooling, messy \u201cHooch\u201d in the 1989 Tom Hanks\u2019 film, Turner and Hooch.\u201d Minimal grooming required and not being a shedder is music to the ears of dog owners who hate a shaggy, shedding dog. As with many dogs, raising these from a puppy means you\u2019ll want to set clear boundaries while exposing them to the outside world to get a healthy attitude toward strangers and other dogs.

The Drever is a talented hunting dog known for his keen nose and strong work ethic. The Drever is technically a smaller version of the Westphalian Dachsbracke. The Westphalian Dachsbracke was developed from the Deutsche Bracke, an ancient German scenthound that was developed from various Bracke-type dogs and local German hounds during the 18th century. The Deutsche Bracke was officially named in 1900, up until which point the Westphalian Dachsbracke was still considered a German hound. It was recognized by the FCI in 1935, though there were still two distinctive sizes for the breed. The smaller version of the Westphalian Dachsbracke was given the name Drever and was recognized by the Swedish Kennel Club in 1947. The Drever was developed from the Westphalian Dachsbracke after it was brought from Germany to Sweden in 1910. It was also crossbred with other Swedish hounds.

This breed can be a bit independent at times, but they are never aggressive. The Drever is a healthy breed, as evidenced by its average lifespan of 13 to 15 years. This breed is generally regarded as healthy, though there are few health studies to either prove or disprove this fact. It is worth noting that the Drever is bred almost exclusively for its working ability, so any health defects would be quickly eliminated.

Like many scenthounds, the Drever has a short, harsh coat. This dog\u2019s coat is a little longer than most scenthounds and the length is uniform over the entire body, but slightly longer on the back, neck, and rump. Color is not the most important characteristic for this breed but there is a requirement for white markings on the chest, neck, face, and feet. As long as these markings are there, the coat can be any color or combination of colors. The average litter size for the Drever breed is 3 to 6 puppies. Because this is a fairly small breed, puppies grow to reach their maximize size quickly.

It is a scent hound breed developed in Norway, known for its friendly temperament and excellent hunting skills.

The Dunker is also known as the Norwegian Hound because that is its country of origin. The Dunker is also known as the Norwegian Hound because that is its country of origin. The breed was developed by crossing the Russian Harlequin Hound with various Norwegian scent hound breeds. The Dunker is the result of breeding efforts made by military officer and Norwegian author Captain Wilhelm Conrad Dunker who sought to create a new breed that was able to work in the harsh conditions for which his homeland is known. After crossing the Russian Harlequin Hound with various scent hound breeds like the English Foxhound and other Russian hounds, the Dunker was born. The breed came to be known for its strong scenting abilities as well as its uniquely dappled coat. Though the Dunker is very popular in Norway, it is largely unknown outside its home of Scandinavia. The Dunker was recognized by the FCI in the early 1900s but has yet to gain recognition from the AKC. A breed developed in Scandinavia, the Dunker is the result of a crossing between the Russian Harlequin Hound and various native Norwegian scent hound breeds. As a medium-sized breed, the Dunker can be fed a high-quality dry food formulated for adult dogs. If you plan to use your dog for hunting or dog sports, however, an active formula may be a better option. High levels of protein will help your dog maintain lean muscle mass and extra fat will provide energy. Just be sure to monitor your dog\u2019s food intake to prevent obesity.

These dogs are intelligent and they respond very well to hunting training, though they can be stubborn when it comes to training in other areas. This breed can be stubborn, determined, and independent at times which can make training difficult but which also makes him a better hunting dog. These characteristics make the Dunker tricky for inexperienced dog owners, so they are best kept by dog owners who are experienced with training and who can dedicate plenty of time to the dog. The Dunker is a medium-sized scent hound breed, standing between 18.5 and 21.5 inches tall and weighing 25 to 40 pounds at maturity. The male of the breed is a little larger, standing 19.5 to 21.5 inches tall while females stand 18.5 to 20.5 inches tall. The Dunker was developed for hunting and that is how he is predominantly kept. This being the case, there is not a great deal of information out there about his temperament in a home or family setting. Generally speaking, scent hounds like the Dunker are non-aggressive and tolerant of strangers, so they don\u2019t tend to do well as guard dogs. They can be affectionate with family and may be tolerant with children as well, provided they get plenty of socialization and training at an early age. This breed also enjoys the company of other dogs but is less tolerant of non-canine pets. The Dunker is generally a healthy breed, but all dogs are prone to certain health problems. Some of the issues known to affect the breed include hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, chronic ear infections, and demodectic mange. The average lifespan for the Dunker is thought to be about 12 to 15 years which is about average for a breed of its size. The Dunker is kept almost exclusively as a hunting dog, so his needs for exercise are very high.

The breed exhibits a variety of colors but the most common colors are black or blue marbled with a pale fawn color and accompanied by white markings. Less desirable colors include a warm brown or predominantly black palette with a black mask and white markings covering more than 50% of the body. The average litter size for the Dunker breed is 3 to 7 puppies. The Dunker is not a giant breed, but it can be fairly sizable with some dogs weighing as much as 50 pounds at maturity.

All of them have special qualities. While you may be better acquainted with its cousins, the German Shepherd and the Belgian Shepherd, the Dutch Shepherd is an all-around amazing dog that is a great fit for any active family (this pup will tucker you all out!). With three types to choose from (longhair, shorthair and wirehair), the Dutch Shepherd is a rare sight at the dog park. Thankfully, fanciers are working hard to increase its numbers. And it\u2019s a good thing they are: this is a super intelligent dog that owns the ring when it comes to obedience competitions, guard duty, and field/agility trailing. While the Dutch might not be the most popular Shepherd yet, that will change. People are only just starting to realize what a special pooch this guy truly is! Even though the Dutch Shepherd made its debut on the farm, this breed now makes a wonderful companion for your family. Obedient and smart, this dog is a pleasure to train and will watch over your family. And because he\u2019s loving and playful, kids will always have a pal to play with. He will fit in well to just about every home, provided that you have the space and energy necessary to keep him happy! If you have been considering bringing a Dutch Shepherd into your home, you\u2019ve come to the right place! Keep your eyes on this page. We\u2019re about to break down everything that you need to now about this special doggo.  Even though the Dutch Shepherd made its debut on the farm, this breed now makes a wonderful companion for your family. Hailing from The Netherlands, the Dutch Shepherd was traditionally used as a shepherd\u2019s dog in the countryside. They would watch over flocks of sheep, keeping them in line and warding off any potential threats..  Not only did they have to guard them, these dogs also had to keep the sheep away from crops by patrolling the borders of the road and the fields. On top of all of that, Dutch Shepherds accompanied sheep as they made their way to common meadows, markets, and ports. These were highly trained (and highly useful) working dogs that proved to be quite popular for obvious reasons. The Dutch Shepherd was a jack-of-all-trades on the farm, which made him indispensable to farmers. They would keep the hens away from the kitchen garden, herd cows for milking, and pull the milk carts. This breed remains an excellent watch and guard dog to this day, as they alerted farmers to strangers for generations. By the 1900s, sheep flocks had all but disappeared in The Netherlands, so the Dutch Shepherd was no longer needed on the farm. However, this breed is now being used as a police dog, as a search and tracking dog, and as a guide dog for the blind. This is a highly trainable pooch who loves to serve. Sadly, the breed\u2019s numbers have dwindled and it is not as popular as the Belgian Shepherd or German Shepherd in North America. Even in The Netherlands, the Dutch Shepherds are rare and the wire-haired variety is few and far between. Hopefully this will change because these are remarkable animals who deserve more happy homes. Sharing a similar standard to Belgian and German Shepherds, the Dutch Shepherd\u2019s origin can be traced to the same continental herding dogs. This breed evolved in the early 1800s in the southern part of the Netherlands and Belgium. Slowly they expanded throughout the world, but not with the same pup-ularity of their Shepherd brethren. These energetic and large dogs need a well-balanced, nutritious diet to support their overall health. A specific ratio of meat-based protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs is the magic formula, especially when fortified with essential minerals and vitamins. In most cases, all of these nutrients can be found in high-quality dry food for dogs. The Dutch Shepherd will do well on a diet of premium kibble, as long as it is made from high-grade materials and meets their unique needs. In other words, choose kibble that is suitable for their age (puppy, adult, or senior) and their size and activity level. High-quality dry food for large and athletic dogs is usually a good match. To prevent bloat, split their recommended daily serving of kibble into two separate meals. As always, if you are ever uncertain about your Dutch Shepard\u2019s diet, you should consult a veterinarian. Dog food manufacturers can only provide general guidelines and since every pooch is different, these guidelines aren\u2019t always perfect. Only your vet can judge the best possible diet for your specific pooch. So feel free to ask them about this at your next check up. That\u2019s why you have a vet after all. Don\u2019t be afraid to use them! The Dutch Shepherd is a pleasure to train. The Dutch Shepherd is a pleasure to train. This breed is intelligent and naturally trainable. In fact, it is believed to be the most competent of all shepherd dogs, especially when it comes to agility, obedience competitions, guard duty, herding, and field trailing. This also makes the breed a great choice for service duty, police work, and search and rescue training. The Dutch Shepherd might not be the most popular Shepherd out there, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t the best!  Because this breed is so smart, it\u2019s important to establish your role as the pack leader. With dogs that are this intelligent, a stubborn streak is a common occurrence. However, a little patience and the right training approach should ensure that this won\u2019t be an issue. Your Dutch Shepherd must learn his place within the family unit. Of course, taking a stance as the pack leader doesn\u2019t mean you have to be harsh or cruel- simply maintain a confident and firm attitude. Rely on positive reinforcement tactics instead of aversive methods (which are closer to abuse than training) and you\u2019ll be set for success. Using rewards to motivate a smart dog always works, and once your Dutchie figures out that doing something gets them a treat and praise, you can count on them wanting to what they\u2019re told. Stick with it and you\u2019ll be amazed what you can train your Dutch Shepherd to do. These doggos live to work and please their owners. You will have so much funny discovering what they are capable of, along with your entire family.  The Dutch Shepherd weighs between 50 and 70 pounds.  Reliable, alert, intelligent, and intuitive, the Dutch Shepherd is loyal to his family. Their devotion to their owners, as well as their alertness, are what makes these dogs such great watchdogs and guard dogs. The Dutch Shepherd will protect what is his and make sure you know if someone is intruding (especially if your pup is specially trained to behave like this). Yet, while they do excel as guard dogs (and working dogs in a variety of roles), these shepherds also make fantastic family pets. You\u2019ll find this dog to be affectionate, happy and obedient (if trained, of course). That\u2019s a wonderful combination to have in any dog and they will light up any home. As soon as they\u2019re done with adventuring for the day, your Dutch Shepherd will happily curl up under your feet or ask to get some ear scratches and cuddles. If there are older children in the home, they\u2019ll love playing with their new pet. As long as they\u2019re big enough not to be knocked over and respectful towards dogs, the Dutch Shepherd will love to be their playmate. This is a pup who will bond with his fam for life and you\u2019ll quickly feel the same way about him too!  One of the most impressive traits of these shepherds is their human-like intelligence. In fact, some experts claim that they\u2019re among the smartest shepherd breeds. Considering the prestigious canine competition, that\u2019s saying a lot. To be happy, the Dutch Shepherd needs plenty of physical and mental stimulation. This is an independent breed, so the Dutch Shepherd can have a will of its own. But most of all, this dog loves attention and loves to learn. As long as you keep your Dutch Shepherd stimulated, he will keep your whole family happy.  The Dutch Shepherd boasts no serious physical or mental hereditary illnesses.There have been some reports of hip dysplasia, but these instances are quite low. Buying a puppy from OFA certified parents (both hips and elbows) greatly diminishes the risk of dysplasia.  OFA results for certified dysplasia-free Dutch Shepherds can viewed at the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals website. As always, it\u2019s important to maintain regular checkups with your vet to ensure that any health issues can be spotted and treated early and effectively. The Dutch Shepherd has an average lifespan of 13 to 15 years. An excellent all-round utility dog, the Dutch Shepherd excels at agility, obedience competitions, guard work, herding, and field trailing. You need to be active to keep up with this dog. Daily exercise is a necessity. Make sure to take your dog out for lots of walks, runs, hikes, or bike rides. You should have a yard, so your dog can run around on his own. This is not an animal that will do well in an apartment building. He needs plenty of space, fresh air, and exercise to live his best and happiest life. If your Dutch Shepherd doesn\u2019t get the activity he needs, he will find his own amusement. This includes destroying your possessions. He needs to work, both mentally and physically. Otherwise, things could get ugly. You\u2019ve been warned! Reliable, alert, intelligent, and intuitive, the Dutch Shepherd is loyal to his family. The American Kennel Club advanced this breed from their Foundation Stock Service program to Miscellaneous Class, as their numbers and popularity in the United States note significant growth. However, they\u2019re still not officially recognized by this canine club- that\u2019s the next step, and hopefully one that the organization will take soon. The AKC, however, holds this breed in high esteem- here\u2019s what they have to say about these Netherland natives: \u201c The Dutch Shepherd is a lively, athletic, alert and intelligent breed, and has retained its herding instinct for which it was originally developed. Having an independent nature, it can be slightly obstinate and have a mind of its own.\u201d There are three different types of Dutch Shepherd coats. These are shorthair (quite hard, not too short); wirehair (curly, medium length hair that\u2019s dense harsh and tousled); and longhair (long, straight, flat and harsh). With all coat types, the color remains the same: various brindles in all shades of gold and silver. Golden can vary from light sand to chestnut red. Socialization should start at an early age for the Dutch Shepherd. As well, obedience training should start as soon as possible to establish your role as the pack leader. While the Dutch Shepard is renowned as a working dog and beloved as a pet, they still need to be raised right. Training and socializing your pup early is absolutely vital to ensure a long and loving relationship. So don\u2019t delay at training your Dutch Shepard or at least sign them up for training classes.", "facts": " AKC Foundation Stock Service Families with children, farms/rural areas, watchdog, guard duty, houses with yards Affectionate, loyal, energetic, enthusiastic worker", "tags": "Dutch Shepherd, guard dog, police dog, rare breeds, search and rescue work, sheep herding, The Netherlands, watchdog, "}, "east siberian laika": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/east-siberian-laika/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/East-Siberian-Laika-668x494.jpg", "name": "East Siberian Laika", "type": "dog", "text": "The Laika is a Russian-type dog that existed in the country for many years and they retain many of the traits they inherited from their wild ancestor, the wolf.

They also make good watchdogs because they have natural protective instincts. As an ancient breed, the East Siberian Laika is a fairly healthy and hardy breed. Still, like all dogs, they are prone to certain health problems as well as hunting-related injuries. Some of the conditions known to affect the breed include monorcidism, umbilical hernia, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and others.

Originally bred as a hunting dog, the English Foxhound is an iconic symbol of the British Hunt. They are somewhat similar in appearance to Beagles and have the distinctive black, white and tan body colorations. Their ears are drooping and hang close to their heads. Their tales on the other hand are strong and erect and end off in a sharp point. The English Foxhound is a strongly built breed and has strong-boned, muscular legs, all giving it the appearance of a well-chiseled athlete. The English Foxhound was bred for its hunting and tracking abilities. It is strong, determined and tenacious, making it an excellent field dog. They are also highly sociable creatures and make excellent companions for highly active owners. However, English Foxhounds bred for the show ring might be a better option for owners looking for a more laid-back Foxhound. And although smaller creatures might stir up their prey instincts, these dogs generally get along excellently with other animals and pets. Originally bred as a hunting dog, the English Foxhound is an iconic symbol of the British Hunt. The English Foxhound was England\u2019s answer to Britain\u2019s depleting deer population. In the early 1600s, deer was hunted heavily in England both for food and for sport, which resulted in a fast decline of the species\u2019 population; which in turn led the British to pursue a different type of hunt: the fox hunt. This called for a hunting dog with speed, great stamina and a keen sense of smell; all characteristics that the English Foxhound possesses. During the British Raj, English Foxhound\u2019s were used in India for Jackal coursing, but did not enjoy long life spans due to the significantly hotter climate. This breed was created by crossing greyhounds for their speed, fox terriers for their hunting instincts and bulldogs for their great resolve during hunting. English Foxhounds are highly active dogs and require a nutritious diet. They should be fed 2-3 cups of high quality dry food in two sittings per day. Like most other hound breeds, English Foxhounds are highly independent and can sometimes be stubborn. Like most other hound breeds, English Foxhounds are highly independent and can sometimes be stubborn. Therefore they require firm, assertive leadership and consistent training. They are also bred to hunt in packs and require this firm leadership to be well-balanced. Obedience training can however take time and patience. Owners may experience trouble with the \u201ccome\u201d command, especially when walking this dog without a leash. Their prey instincts are easily aroused and they can run off in pursuit of interesting \u2018prey\u2019 if walked off leash. The ideal weight for a full-grown English Foxhound ranges from 55 to 75 pounds. As with most other high energy hunting breeds, the English Foxhound responds well to owners that are calm and assertive. They require rules, boundaries and limitations as well as love and will be extremely happy when provided with consistent leadership. As with most other working dogs, English Foxhounds can become bored and eventually destructive when not provided with a \u2018meaningful\u2019 task. Therefore it is important that they be given mentally challenging jobs as well as physically challenging ones. English Foxhounds were bred to work in packs and with humans, and are therefore highly sociable animals. They get along well with children and other large animals like horses. They can sometimes chase smaller animals that they view as prey if they are not given boundaries and rules early on. English Foxhounds have a loud, baying bark, which is a desirable characteristic in a guard dog. However, they do not have the protective instincts of other guard dog breeds. English Foxhounds, like most other large and active breeds are prone to hip dysplasia and should be examined regularly for joint problems as the dog ages. They are also known to occasionally suffer from kidney disease and epileptic fits. The latter is a hereditary disorder that cannot be completely cured but can be treated with medication. A healthy English Foxhound has an average life span of 10-13 years. This breed has very high levels of energy and has been bred to be able to run continuously throughout the day with only a few breaks. Therefore it is extremely important to exercise it daily for at least an hour.

Although similar in appearance to his American Foxhound cousin, the English version is shorter and much stouter in appearance. The English Foxhound was recognized by the AKC in 1909. The English Foxhound\u2019s coat is thick, short and shiny and should be brushed weekly with a rough cloth or hound mitt to remove excess hair. This is as much grooming as the English Foxhound needs and should be bathed occasionally if particularly dirty or smelly. Like most independent, high energy breeds of dogs, English Foxhound puppies should be socialized from a very early age.

The Pointer, also known as the English Pointer, is a friendly and intelligent dog with a strong built and high energy levels that loves to hunt. The history of the Pointer breed is up for debate, though records of the breed date back to about 1650. One source claims that the Pointer breed was developed during the 16th and 17th centuries when other pointing breeds such as the Portuguese and the Spanish Pointer were brought to England from the mainland. Though the exact details of the breed\u2019s history are unknown, it is commonly thought that four breeds played a role in the breed\u2019s development \u2013 the Greyhound, Foxhound, Bull Terrier, and the Bloodhound. The Pointer breed was first brought to the United States in the late 1800s. At this time, the English Setter was the bird-hunting dog of choice and pointing breeds were not allowed to compete in field trials alongside setters. By 1910 the Pointer breed had been developed to the point that it out-competed setters. Today, the Pointer is a member of the Sporting Group for the AKC. Though this breed is often referred to as the English Pointer, its official name even with the British Kennel Club is simply Pointer. The Pointer breed is thought to have been developed from four established breeds whose characteristics were useful in developing the hunting abilities of the breed. These include the Greyhound, Foxhound, Bull Terrier, and the Bloodhound. Given that the English Pointer is a naturally active breed, you should consider providing him with a dog food formulated for active dogs, particularly one with a high protein content. You should also make sure that the food is formulated to meet the needs of large-breed dogs. If your dog does not receive daily exercise, be careful not to overfeed him or he may become obese.

The Pointer reaches an average height between 23 and 28 inches and achieves a weight of 44 to 75 lbs. at maturity. Males of the breed tend to be slightly larger than females. The Pointer is an active and friendly breed that is affectionate with family. These dogs love to spend time with family and they typically do very well with children when they are raised together from a young age. It is important to note, however, that Pointers can be rambunctious so supervision around children is recommended. This breed is not suited for apartment-style or urban living because they require a great deal of daily exercise and plenty of time outdoors. English Pointers generally get along well with other dogs and household pets when raised together, though they may be a little too interested in pet birds so keep the two apart. Exercise is incredibly important for the health and wellbeing of the Pointer breed. These dogs are generally healthy but, like all dogs, they are prone to developing certain conditions. Some of the most common conditions affecting the Pointer breed include entropion, cataracts, hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, and epilepsy. These dogs are also prone to allergies and minor injuries related to hunting and tracking. The average lifespan of the Pointer breed is between 12 and 15 years. Because the Pointer was bred for hunting, it is a naturally high-energy dog that requires a good deal of daily exercise.

Well, instantly recognizable as long as you know what English Setters look like. This breed, of course, belongs to the setter group and is similarly bred for both athleticism and a workmanlike attitude. You don\u2019t have to go very far for a friend if you\u2019ve got an English Setter. But if you want to have an answer to that question \u201cWhat kind of breed is that?\u201d you\u2019ve got to know a thing or two about English Setters. Don\u2019t worry\u2026 you\u2019re about to learn. Generally easy-going, the English Setter is prone to obedience and loyalty. One glance at the name of this breed will tell you that this dog was originally bred for hunting, like many similar dogs and dogs in its pedigree. The English Setter\u2019s position in the world of hunting, at least as it started out, was to flush out game and make it ready to shoot. Quite simply, the English Setter needs to not only have a good nose, but a good ability to understand a specific task and perform it with obedience and loyalty. That obedience and loyalty has marked the history of the English Setter through some four or five hundred years of breeding. Experts place the English Setters roots this far back as it\u2019s quite apparent that the English Setter has been helping hunters all over the world for at least a few centuries. During the 19th century, the Setter saw a lot of further development and breeding, especially as a man named R. Percival Llewellin bred English Setters to enhance its beauty and its overall look. Consequently, the English Setter today has a very distinctive appearance and can be considered one of the best-looking dogs that belong to the setter group. Between Spanish Pointers and large Water Spaniels, it\u2019s clear that the English Setter\u2019s roots go deep into a history of athleticism and hunting. This is apparent, of course, in the modern English Setter\u2019s own heritage \u2013 its English Setter ancestry \u2013 but the pedigree of the entire breed itself does have its roots in a good gene pool of working dogs and expert hunters. Today\u2019s English Setters can often trace their roots, of course, back to England, where many English Setters were bred and developed in the 1800s, as mentioned in the previous section. English Setters don\u2019t have any particularly outrageous demands or needs as it relates to diet. Since they\u2019re healthy exercisers, you\u2019ll want to make sure you include plenty of calories in their diet. These calories should not all come from salty \u201ctreats,\u201d but rather should include a balance of nutrition and healthy snacks. Training an English Setter doesn\u2019t necessarily require a heavy amount of experience in training dogs. Generally easy-going, the English Setter is prone to obedience and loyalty. But you\u2019ll want to make sure their training focuses on making them feel useful around the house, as this breed has been selected for its ability to help out with a hunt.

Weighing anywhere from around 45-80 pounds (with the females often about five to 10 pounds lighter than the males), the English Setter is a prototypical mid-to-large sized dog that will require a good amount of food to keep up a healthy and active lifestyle. With proper training, the English Setter is no trouble at all, but without it, can find its way into trouble. These dogs have been referred to as \u201cgentlemen,\u201d but you\u2019ll find that individual personalities can vary. With proper training, the English Setter is no trouble at all, but without it, can find its way into trouble.

A relatively healthy dog that is simply prone to a few problems relating to large dogs \u2013 such as hip dysplasia \u2013 this dog doesn\u2019t really suffer from many genetic or hereditary diseases.

While the Spaniel itself has been around for several hundred years, the diversification and classification of the different Spaniel breeds has taken a bit longer. During the 1800s, when many dog breeds were both being developed and classified, the Spaniel breeds began splitting up as well. It wasn\u2019t unusual for these Spaniels to take on the name of the place they were developed. By around 1910, the English Springer had finally reached a level meriting a classification of its own in the United States and the breed was soon born. But in England, this breed was already well-known, as the classification had endured since 1902. Today, we associate this excited breed as a classic of the Spaniel class, but in truth the English Springer Spaniel is a refreshing update of a classic breed. Like many Spaniels, the English Springer Spaniel shares its ancestry with a number of familiar breeds like the Cocker Spaniel. Since the Spaniel breeds tend to be well-intertwined in terms of their heritage over the years \u2013 thanks primarily to the new classification of many breeds over just the past few hundred years or so \u2013 the English Springer Spaniel doesn\u2019t vary a lot from the classic breeds in the world of Spaniels.

A mid-sized breed capable of plenty of exercise, a good diet for an English Springer Spaniel should include some meat and whole foods like vegetables.

Generally an obedient breed, the English Springer Spaniel should not be a difficult dog to give commands. There\u2019s generally a discrepancy between the weight of males and females, with the males reaching up to around 55 pounds and the females reaching around 35 pounds. Keep in mind there may be some natural fluctuations with your own dog but also to keep a close eye on its weight on a weekly-to-monthly basis. The overall personality of the English Springer Spaniel is very dog-like: loyal, ready to obey, happy to play. There is some evidence that English Springer Spaniels suffer from Rage syndrome, as Cocker Spaniels can, which is an unexplained sudden rage that quickly returns to normal behavior.

It is believe that the English Toy Spaniel is a descendant of some of the Asian breeds such as the Japanese Chin and the Pekingese. In the late 1600s, English Toy Spaniels were bred with Pugs, thus creating a dog with a shorter muzzle and smaller size. During the 1800s, the breed was still being crossed with various exotic short-muzzled dogs. This resulted in the apple-headed, short-muzzled dogs with prominent eyes that we know today. If there is one thing that English Toy Spaniels like to do, it\u2019s eat. They love eating and would be happy to nosh all day. This isn\u2019t healthy for them as they will become overweight.

The American Kennel Club writes: \u201cThe English Toy Spaniel is a gentle, happy and playful loving breed that is naturally well-behaved and intelligent. They are good family companions and play well with children. Their small size makes them ideal for an apartment. All varieties of the English Toy Spaniel are easy-to-groom and require regular twice-weekly combing and brushing.\u201d The English Toy Spaniel was first recognized by the AKC in 1886. Those who enjoy spending time grooming their dogs will find the English Toy Spaniel to be perfect. This breed\u2019s coat is long and profuse. Feathering covers the ears, legs, chest and body. The coat should be straight or moderately wavy but it should always be silky and glossy. There are four colors and classifications with the English Toy Spaniel breed. Dogs with a mahogany red coloring are called the Ruby. Those with black, tan and white are called the Prince Charles. Black and tan coated dogs are called the King Charles. Dogs with a white body and red patches on the body as well as a red dot on the head are called the Blenheim. Because of its profuse coat, daily brushing and combing is needed with a Charlie. Bathing is important to its overall health. The English Toy Spaniel should be bathed at least every other week. Without proper grooming, this breed can experience skin infections and flaking skin. Charlie puppies are absolutely adorable but they are extremely fragile. They can easily be killed by hugging them too tightly or even tripping and falling on them. Caution must be taken when living with puppies and adults of this breed. Early socialization is important for English Toy Spaniels to lead happy lives. Without it, they can become shy and fearful of strangers.

The English Toy Terrier is a rare dog breed that\u2019s perfect for condos \u2013 if you can find one. The English Toy Terrier was developed in England from a breed known as the Old English Black and Tan Terrier. This breed was developed for its speed and agility because it was used for rat pitting \u2013 this is a sport that involved placing a dog in a pit with rats and betting on how quickly the dog would kill them. When this sport was outlawed the English Toy Terrier came to be popular in the conformation show ring instead. Having an elegant appearance, this terrier breed was immediately successful. The Kennel Club recognized two varieties of the Black and Tan Terrier (as it was known at the time) until the 1920s when it split the breed by size into the Manchester Terrier and the Miniature Black and Tan Terrier. The name English Toy Terrier wasn\u2019t adopted until the 1960s. In the United States, the breed is known as a toy version of the Standard Manchester Terrier. The English Toy Terrier was developed from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier and it is also closely related to the Manchester Terrier which was developed in England during the 19th century. The English Toy Terrier is a small-breed dog so it should be fed a dog food diet formulated for dogs of its size. Small-breed dogs have high energy needs and fast metabolisms so their diet should container higher levels of fat (a highly concentrated source of energy) than a diet for large-breed dogs. Make sure to choose a diet made from high-quality ingredients including animal proteins.

The term Sennenhund originates from the Swiss term Senn, which means herder. The Entlebucher is a short, powerfully built dog. Its head is well-proportioned to its body and its eyes are small and lively. Like most other herding breeds it has extremely powerful jaws and thick, strong legs that support its sturdy body. It has a distinctive tri-color coat with tan, white and black markings. A highly intelligent and extremely loving dog, the Entlebucher is also a spirited athlete with specific exercise and training requirements. This makes it a dog unsuitable for most casual dog owners. It can however make a wonderful companion for dog owners willing to put in the time and effort to fulfill its needs. The Entlebucher Mountain Dog is the smallest, but in no way least significant, member of the family of four Swiss mountain dogs or Sennenhunds. The Entlebucher is named after its hometown in the Swiss region of Lucerne. They were first recognized as a distinct breed in 1889 and started to gain attention by breeders and enthusiasts in the early 20th century. The breed\u2019s population however, already weak in numbers, faced a steep decline during World War I and the Entlebucher was all but wiped out. With the close of World War I, 16 specimens of Entlebuchers were gathered and bred by one Franz Schertenleib, thus rejuvenating and restoring the breed. Although the Entlebucher\u2019s exact origins are uncertain, it is believed that they originated from the massive Roman molossers that were used as guard dogs and war dogs. Like most working dogs, Entlebuchers require a well-balanced diet fortified with essential vitamins and nutrients. Entlebucher\u2019s are a highly intelligent species of dog and are extremely eager to please their masters. Entlebucher\u2019s are a highly intelligent species of dog and are extremely eager to please their masters. They are highly trainable and respond extremely well to positive reinforcement based training techniques. They are quite independent and capable of making decisions by themselves and require consistent leadership. Faced with a lack of leadership, the Entlebucher Mountain Dog can often feel the need to assume a leadership role within its human pack which in turn can lead to various behavioral problems. Entlebuchers weigh between 55 to 66 pounds. Entlebuchers are extremely loyal and devoted to their masters and make excellent companions. They get along excellently with children and can be quite protective over them. Care should be taken with smaller children though as these dogs are quite robust and can accidentally injure youngsters and toddlers. Entlebuchers can also be suspicious of strangers and this, along with their self-confidence and bravery, make them excellent watchdogs. They have fairly loud barks, but do not bark unnecessarily. Like most working dogs, Entlebuchers require a great deal of mental stimulation to remain happy and balanced. They are eager competitors in most sporting events and other agility events. They are also excellent for work with large animals such as hogs, cattle and horses. Because the foundation stock of Entlebuchers was so small, these dogs are known to suffer from several hereditary ailments such as hip dysplasia, hemolytic anemia and progressive retinal atrophy. A well cared for Entlebucher can often live up to 15 years of age. Bred to herd cattle across the Swiss Alps for days on end, Entlebuchers have a virtually inexhaustible amount of energy. Therefore it is important that they be provided with at least an hour of vigorous exercise each day. It is also beneficial for these dogs to have a meaningful task to which they can devote themselves to. Entlebuchers are extremely loyal and devoted to their masters and make excellent companions. The AKC has this to say about the Entlebucher: \u201cThe Entlebucher Mountain Dog is a native of Switzerland and the smallest of the four tri-colored Swiss Mountain Dogs, which also include the Appenzeller Sennenhund, Bernese Mountain Dog and the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. The Entlebucher is a medium-sized, compact and strongly muscled. He has a short, hard, tricolor coat that is bright black with symmetrical markings of pure white on blaze, muzzle, chest, and feet; shades of rich fawn to mahogany are present on the eyebrows and between the black and white markings. Although primarily a herding and general all-purpose dog, Entles excel at competitive sports and are willing and enthusiastic partners in any athletic canine activity chosen by their master.\u201d The Entlebucher was recognized by the American Kennel Association in 2011. The Entlebucher\u2019s coat is short and smooth to the touch. This dog is an average shedder and should be brushed at least once a week.

The founder of the breed, Julius Wipfel, originally set out with a small group of dog breeders to create a breed that combined the best features of the Wolfspitz (better known as a Keeshond) and the Chow Chow. The first crossing of these two breeds was named the Wolf-Chow. It wasn\u2019t until about 12 years later that this breed was crossed with the Samoyed to create what is now known as the Eurasier breed. The Eurasier was recognized by the FCI in 1973 but it was more than 20 years before another kennel club accepted it. It was accepted by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1995, admitted into the Foundation Stock Service for the AKC in 2008, and recognized by The Kennel Club in 2013. The original crossing used to create the Eurasier breed was between a Wolfspitz and a Chow Chow. This crossing was named the Wolf-Chow and it was later bred with a Samoyed to create what is now known as the Eurasier breed. The Eurasier is a medium-sized dog so it should be fed a high-quality diet that is properly formulated to meet the nutritional needs of a dog this size. Unfortunately, most commercial pet food companies do not create size-specific formulas for medium-sized breeds so you may have to choose a standard adult formula instead. The Eurasier breed is not highly active and it is not classified as a working breed so an active breed formula is not necessary. Though the Eurasier is not overly active, it is still an intelligent and highly trainable breed. Though the Eurasier is not overly active, it is still an intelligent and highly trainable breed.

This breed can be trained as a therapy dog and they generally do well around children and other pets.

With a nickname like Fieldie, there\u2019s no doubt that the Field Spaniel is a bird hunter\u2019s dream. Originating in England during the 1800s, the Field Spaniel was a favorite of bird hunters. His ability to zigzag through the dense brush and flush out prey was highly prized. Not only was he used as a tool for putting food on the table, the Field Spaniel was also a cherished companion for the hunter\u2019s family. Today, they are rarely used for hunting but the breed has acclimated quite well to living life as a companion. In the 1800s, there was no clear classification defining the difference between Field Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels before maturity. Back then, a Cocker Spaniel was an adult weighing less than 25 pounds while a Field Spaniel was an adult over 25 pounds. The pedigree of the parents was not taken into consideration which led to owners not knowing what breed they had until the puppy matured. In 1901, the distinction between the breeds was determined by the parent\u2019s ancestry. After some poor choices regarding the addition of other breeds into the bloodlines, the Field Spaniels popularity dwindled. It became way too long, had too much coat and an oddly large head. The Fieldie simply was not pleasant to look at, nor could it flush prey as well. Mortimer Smith, an English gentleman returned the breed to its original appearance and structure. In 1909, a devastating fire swept through a kennel harboring the most of the Field Spaniels in the United States. From 1931 through 1967, there were no registrations of Field Spaniels with the American Kennel Club. Since that time, more Fieldies were imported to the U.S. Although not one of the most popular breeds, the Field Spaniel has a dedicated following of his own. It\u2019s best to feed the Field Spaniel a diet of high-quality, dry kibble specifically formulated for his activity level. Of course, a Fieldie who is out hunting all day will require more food than the dog that is less active. Although the Field Spaniel has an independent streak, he is relatively easy to train.

This is often a problem with neighbors so it is essential that the dog understand the \u201cquiet\u201d command. Field Spaniels also enjoy chewing things up. Toys and chewies should be made available at all times to dissuade the dog from chewing apart your belongings. Allergies and ear problems occur quite often in the breed as do eye problems including cataracts, Ectropion and progressive retinal atrophy. Epilepsy, cancer and hypothyroidism have been diagnosed in Field Spaniels. Although rare in most medium sized dog breeds, hip dysplasia has been found in the Fieldie. On the average, Field Spaniels live to be between 12 and 14 years old. A complete bundle of energy, the Field Spaniel needs about an hour of exercise daily. Playing in a large, fenced yard is one of the best ways for a Fieldie to stretch his legs and run freely however; hiking in the woods or jogging through the neighborhood will also suffice. Field Spaniels love the water. With access to a pond, lake or stream, the Fieldie will frolic for hours, providing his family with laughter at his funny antics.

The American Kennel Club writes: \u201cKnown for its level-headedness and perseverance, the Field Spaniel is a medium-sized flushing spaniel, built for activity and endurance in heavy cover and water. One of the rarest spaniel breeds (they nearly went extinct!); the Field possesses moderately long, pendulous ears and a single coat that is both dense and water-repellent. He can be black, liver or golden liver in color; tan points or white markings are acceptable.\u201d The Field Spaniel was accepted in the AKC\u2019s Sporting Group in 1894.

The Fieldie\u2019s coat can be black, roan or liver in color. Tan points or white on the chest and throat area can also occur in the breed. Grooming a Field Spaniel is a snap. All this breed needs is a weekly brushing to remove loose coat and ensure that the feathering isn\u2019t snarled or matted. Bathing should only be done when he gets dirty or malodorous. Field Spaniel puppies should be introduced to as many things and people from the start. He should also attend puppy kindergarten classes to get the basics of training.

This breed is known for its tracking skills and aggressiveness, qualities that can be valuable in a working breed, but it also has a bit of an impetuous side. In addition to being useful as a tracking breed, the Fila Brasileiro also makes a great guard dog, watch dog, and shepherd dog. Although the Fila Brasileiro is an excellent working breed, its temperament and size mean that it is not the right breed for everyone. The Fila Brasileiro is also known as the Brazilian Mastiff. The Fila Brasileiro was developed as a large working breed in Brazil, used to track and chase down large predators. During the time when slavery was legal in Brazil, the Fila Brasileiro was also used to track down escaped slaves and to hold them until the master arrived. This breed was developed during the 15th century from breeds like the English mastiff, bulldog, and bloodhound. It retains many physical characteristics similar to the Bloodhound, though it is surprisingly agile and fast. The first breed standard was written in 1946 but the breed still hasn\u2019t been recognized by the American Kennel Club or the United Kennel Club. The breed is banned in several countries due to its impetuous temperament and potential for aggression. In some countries import is allowed but males must be neutered. The Fila Brasileiro was developed from the English mastiff, bulldog, and bloodhound. Because the Fila Brasileiro is a large-breed dog you should feed him a dog food diet that is specially formulated for larger breeds. It is especially important that you feed him a large-breed puppy formula until he is 18 to 24 months old to prevent him from growing too quickly. This breed is known for its tracking skills and aggressiveness, qualities that can be valuable in a working dog. The Fila Brasileiro is an intelligent breed which is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the Fila Brasileiro responds well to training and learns quickly but, on the other hand, he requires a firm hand in training to prevent it from becoming too independent. This breed does best when it is given a job to do and can be trained for tracking, guarding, and shepherding. The Fila Brasileiro requires a strong authority figure and obedience training should be maintained throughout the dog\u2019s life. The Fila Brasileiro is a large breed of dog with males standing 25.5 to 29.5 inches tall and females standing 23.5 to 27.5 inches tall. Males of the breed weigh between 110 and 180 pounds at maturity and females should weigh at least 90 pounds. The Fila Brasileiro has an intense and often impetuous temperament that can be difficult to control at times. This breed was developed to track and hunt large predators, trained to hold them by the neck until their owner arrived. Puppies can be observed exhibiting this type of behavior and adults often retain a high prey drive, often chasing and killing cats and other small animals. The Fila can be friendly and affectionate in the home, even getting along with children, but he cannot be expected to take kindly to strangers. This breed is a strong guard dog and he will not hesitate to fiercely protect his family and territory. Early training and socialization is incredibly important to prevent this dog from becoming overly independent and aggressive. Little is known about the health problems to which the Fila Brasileiro is prone, but some guesses can be made simply due to its size. Large-breed dogs are often more susceptible to musculoskeletal problems like hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia \u2013 they are also at a higher risk for gastric dilation volvulus (or bloat). The Fila Brasileiro can be expected to live for 10 to 12 years with proper care. For such a large breed, the Fila Brasileiro is surprisingly active \u2013 this is probably due to his development as a working/tracking breed.

The most common colors are fawn, black, and brindle, with or without a black mask. White is a very uncommon color for the Fila Brasileiro, though light greys are not uncommon. Because the coat is so short and smooth, grooming is fairly easy \u2013 this dog can be brushed with a bristle brush several times a week. The average litter size for the Fila Brasileiro is between 2 and 5 puppies. Fila Brasileiro puppies should be fed a large-breed puppy formula for at least 18 months to make sure that they get the nutrition they need without growing too quickly.

This is a complex condition that comes about as the result of lesions in the brain. These lesions affect the dog\u2019s coordination and gate as well as his ability to see. This disease is the result of a genetic mutation in the gene SEL1L, so responsible breeding practices are important for this breed. This breed may also be prone to hunting injuries. The average life expectancy for the Finnish Hound is between 11 and 12 years which is about average for a dog of its size. Because the Finnish Hound was developed as a working breed you can expect him to have fairly high energy levels and high needs for exercise.

It is believed that Finnish Lapphunds were created by the Sami, an indigenous group of people that still reside in areas divided between Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia. Reindeer herding is an important aspect of Sami life and culture and the Finnish Lapphund was bred specifically for this purpose. However, it was the Swedes and Norwegians that first sought to standardize the breed prior to World War II. The breed faced a steep decline immediately after World War II due to a serious outbreak of distemper. However, the breed was maintained by various Scandinavian kennel clubs. Around the late 1960s, with the invention of the snowmobile the use of Finnish Lapphunds in herding started to decline sharply. The breed however remained widely popular among the Finnish, and even ranked 6th in a list of most popular companion animals in Finland.

S.E. Shirley is the man most credited with the breed\u2019s development, as was H. R. Cooke of Riverside Kennel. The Flat-Coated Retriever proved to be a popular hunting dog through the end of World War I. As the Labrador and Golden Retrievers became more popular, this breed fell out of favor \u2013 in fact, it almost became extinct! But in the mid-1960s, fans of the breed brought it back. Even though its numbers has risen, it\u2019s still not as popular as it once was and is considered a rare breed. The Flat-Coated Retriever is the result of crossing the Newfoundland with various types of setters, sheepdogs, spaniels and water dogs. Invaluable to fishermen, Flatties were traded between Britain and North America and fell into the generic \u201cLabrador\u201d category. Eventually, the Wavy-Coated (subsequently Flat-Coated) Retriever took shape and took its place as its own breed. This is one active dog, so you\u2019ll need to feed your Flat-Coated Retriever accordingly. Depending on what dry-food kibble you are feeding your dog, the amount will range from 3.5 to 4.5 cups a day, divided into two meals. And you should always feed your Flattie a high-quality dry food.

Another habit you may need to break your Flattie from is coprophagy (eating poop).

These dogs have probably existed in Taiwan for thousands of years, possibly descendant from ancient Southeast Asian hunting dogs. Though it is difficult to say for sure, researchers believe that the first dogs arrived in Taiwan some 10,000 to 20,000 years ago and it is from those early Dingo-like dogs that the Formosan Mountain Dog developed over thousands of years.

How could anyone resist a face like that? On top of that irresistible appearance, these lovable clowns make great family pets and love to play just as much as they love to cuddle. Bringing home a dog \u2013 any dog \u2013 is a big decision, so you want to make the right choice.

Everything that you could possibly want to know about the French Bulldog is about to be revealed. So, read on to find out if this breed is a perfect fit for you. This short, stocky and adorable little fellow always looks like it\u2019s in a good mood. Despite its name, the French Bulldog was employed by lacemakers in 19th-century Nottingham, England. That\u2019s right, these dogs aren\u2019t even a little bit French in origin. In fact, they might even be more English than the English bulldog. We apologize for the false advertising, but as that you not hold it against this remarkable pooch. The original French Bulldog owners selectively bred the early bulldog for a downsized or \u201ctoy\u201d bulldog as a lap pet. At the onset of the Industrial Revolution, some of these lacemakers made their way to France and took the dogs with them. Soon, these toy bulldogs became popular in France, and in the late 1800s, this breed became known as French Bulldogs due to their popularity in the land of the croissant. The breed\u2019s popularity soon spread to North American when wealthy Americans on the Grand Tour fell in love with them. We told you that these pups were irresistible. The French Bulldog was bred from the small French Terrier and the English Bulldog. The result is a smaller, toy version that makes a great lap dog. If that pedigree sounds like a designer dog, that\u2019s because it is. However, because this crossbreed happened a century before the designer dog trend, there have been enough generations of the breed for there to be a consistency in the breed. No designer dog surprises here. The French bulldog is standardized. In fact,  the AKC even recognized the French Bulldog in 1898. It has been a popular show dog ever since.  French Bulldogs are known for its sensitive stomachs, so you must be careful what you feed your pet. Corn and wheat can make your Frenchie itchy, so go with premium dog foods. French Bulldogs love fruit, but only feed your pooch this treat in limited amounts. As with most dogs, it\u2019s always best to focus on premium kibble. However, while dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, these are still just guidelines and should not be treated as gospel. All dogs are different after all, each with their own needs. The only person qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is a veterinarian. This is especially true when it comes to a pup like the French Bulldog with a notoriously sensitive stomach. So, before establishing or altering the diet of your French Bulldog, make sure to seek out the advice of a vet. That way you can be certain that what you poor into the bowl won\u2019t upset his little tum-tum. These lovable clowns make great family pets and love to play just as much as they love to cuddle. Relatively easy to train dogs, you must be consistent and kind when working with your French Bulldog. This breed likes to please its owners, but it is known to have a stubborn streak. This means that if your French Bulldog thinks its pleasing you, it\u2019s more likely to act obediently. You\u2019ll find that negative reinforcement is not the way to train a French Bulldog. So, it\u2019s important to focus on positive reinforcement and reward-based training throughout those early and impressionable puppy days. Not only is that the most effective way to train a French Bulldog, but it\u2019s the best way to train any dog. After all, negative reinforcement is closer to abuse than a training technique. When it comes to housebreaking, the easiest way to teach a French Bulldog is by using a crate. In this method, the dog is kept in the crate and let out to do its business. French Bulldogs want to always be near its owners, so it will pick up the housebreaking rules quickly in order to get out of the crate. Because accidents do happen, try redirecting and a gentle reprimand. Because these pups have such a desire to please, you\u2019ll find that this process will go quite smoothly relative to other breeds. French Bulldogs need proper socialization in order to be happy. Start introducing your Frenchie to people, dogs and other animals from an early age, otherwise your dog will prefer company of one person. Socialization is important, so make an effort to do this as early and often as possible. You don\u2019t want to waste those impressionable puppy days because it\u2019s so much more difficult to break bad habits in adult dogs than it is to establish good habits with puppies.\n\n Both male and female French Bulldogs weigh in the 22 to 28 pound range. A wonderful friend and a good family member, the French Bulldog is playful and has a sweet and funny personality. Although it gets along with everyone, the French Bulldog usually forms a special bond with just one person.

The Frenchie makes a good watchdog and will inform you of any visitors. Since the French Bulldog is a smaller dog, it\u2019s important to keep its weight regulated. Respiratory problems are common, and it worsens if it is overweight, as its abdomen swells and presses against its lungs. In addition to breathing problems, French Bulldogs may suffer from snoring, wheezing and eye problems. And since puppies tend to have large heads, it could lead to caesarean births. Also watch out for dry skin that can result in bald spots on your Frenchie\u2019s coat. It is important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a vet to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. French Bulldogs have a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years. Because French Bulldogs can put on extra weight, it\u2019s important that your dog gets enough daily exercise. Be aware that French Bulldogs are susceptible to heat related problems and should play indoors when it is warm outside. Playing ball or running around in an air conditioned environment is fun and safe \u2013 as long as it is play, the Frenchie doesn\u2019t care where it is. When the weather is right, be sure to take your French Bulldog out for a walk. Stay away from water, as French Bulldogs are poor swimmers, thanks to its short and stout body.

All you need to do is keep reading. These dogs are strong, loyal, and are highly response to training. German Shepherds do indeed get their name from Deutschland, because that\u2019s where the first standard-bred Shepherds appeared. The twist? German Shepherds are actually a relatively young breed, having been fully bred in the 19th century. I\u2019ll bet you didn\u2019t see that coming? This breed is not as old as Germany itself. Instead, it\u2019s a trim 200 years old. Practically a baby. As efforts were being made throughout the 19th century to standardize dog breeds \u2013 perhaps more of an art than a science \u2013 German Shepherds grew out of a group of dogs that were good at shepherding. German dog owners bred dogs that were good at rounding up sheep, protecting the flocks, and had strong, swift bodies. To say these dogs were good at shepherding would be an understatement, they mastered the form and set the standard. At the same time, these proto-German Shepherds often were a great deal different from the Shepherds in other towns and regions in northern Europe. But as enthusiasm for dog breed standardization grew, a man named Max von Stephanitz, a lover of work dogs, found a dog at a dog show that would come to be known as the \u201cfirst\u201d German Shepherd. He changed the dog\u2019s name to Horand von Grafrath and Horand became the founding German Shepherd. Too few German Shepherds have been granted the privilege of having a \u201cvon\u201d in their name since that OG German Shepherd. This needs to be addressed. So, good news reader! When your child asks you why they\u2019re called \u201cGerman Shepherds,\u201d you\u2019ll finally have an amusingly direct answer to give them. Although German Shepherds are young enough that Horand von Grafrath \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 actually posed for a photograph, they still have quite a strong pedigree. You may find that the young age of the breed lends itself to better record keeping. Believe it or not, there wasn\u2019t much breed documentation before the 19th century, so this is as good as it gets. Either way, there are a lot of factors that go into a German Shepherd\u2019s pedigree. Aside from purity, physical looks are very important. A dog of this breed is a true eye catcher after all! Your handsome pup needs to have a great ratio between hip and shoulder height, a balanced coat coloration, distinguished head features, and that iconic, dominant German Shepherd stance. Temperament too plays a crucial role \u2013 an ideal German Shepherd has to display patience, confidence, positive energy, and obedience. With all these physical and personal characteristics combined, your pupper can pride itself on a well deserved pedigree. If you decide to bring in a German Shepherd as a pet, what on earth will you feed it? They can, after all, grow to be quite large. German Shepherds can have a healthy appetite and can go through dog food quickly, so using meat to feed your Shepherd (as well as for training purposes) can go a long way in keeping the dog well fed. Mixing in vegetables such as green beans is a great idea. Some people recommend constructing \u201cpies\u201d or \u201ccasseroles\u201d of assorted ingredients using meats and vegetables together. Either way, meat and veggies are a sure way to rear a healthy and strong dog. They contain all the important nutrients and vitamins that your pet needs to stay strong, happy, and his coat shiny. When it comes to dry dog food, keep in mind that a healthy adult German Shepherd can go through some 40 pounds of it in a month. But whether you choose dry food or meat and veggies, keep in mind that any diet will have to be balanced and perfectly measured. German Shepherds are \u2013 ideally \u2013 strong and muscular dogs, with a powerful frame and plenty of energy. That energy needs to be spent, and the strength maintained \u2013 that\u2019s why playtime and running are crucial. But once that is over, food is the only thing on a Shepherd\u2019s mind. So make sure that it\u2019s tasty and in ample amounts! As always, if you are ever concerned about either establishing or altering your dog\u2019s diet, it\u2019s worth consulting with a veterinarian. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still just guidelines and won\u2019t necessarily apply to every dog. The only person qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is their vet. So always check in with a vet before making any substantial changes to what you pour into your pup\u2019s bowl. Good quality food can really make an impact on every part of your dog\u2019s wellbeing. Thanks to its large size, strength, and ability to behave obediently, German Shepherds are often used for police and military purposes. One of the reasons Shepherds are so popular with pet owners is that they can be highly obedient. This isn\u2019t to say that there aren\u2019t German Shepherds without behavioural issues, but they can indeed make a great pet if you know how to treat them. Treat a German Shepherd right and you\u2019ll have a loyal friend for life. And if you make the rules clear from the start, your four-legged friend\u2019s understanding will make day to day life so much easier for both of you. German Shepherds are considered one of the most intelligent breeds of dogs. Some people find that German Shepherds will adapt to a new behavior after only a few repetitions. You\u2019ll even find that a German Shepherd\u2019s obedience and protective nature will make it an ideal guard dog. What is even better, it is a well known fact that these dogs are perfect around children \u2013 they can be caring, protective, and gentle! An ideal family dog \u2013 through and through. However, it is important to reinforce boundaries with your Shepherd. Your dog should know the difference between welcome and unwelcome visitors; don\u2019t assume that because your German Shepherd is strong that it can\u2019t be controlled with a little calm and rational training. However, it is important to emphasize positive rewards for good behavior rather than punishment (negative reinforcement is often closer to abuse than training). Training and socialization should begin as early as possible, so don\u2019t let those early and impressionable puppy days go to waste. And remember, always be as safe as possible around an animal the size of a Shepherd. In the end, a positive attitude, a firm voice, and a lot of positive reinforcement can ensure a smooth and fast training period \u2013 making the bond between you and your pet stronger than ever! And what of that size? German Shepherds can weigh up to around 90 lbs when you\u2019re talking about an adult male and up to around 70 pounds for an adult female.\nMore than likely, your German Shepherd will end up below these \u201chighs.\u201d You should expect a male Shepherd to grow to between 70 and 90 pounds or so, while a female will grow to between 50 and 70 pounds. Of course, there will be a clear difference between a lean and muscular 70 pound dog \u2013 and a chubby one of the same weight. Don\u2019t disregard the importance of a balanced diet and plenty of exercise. If you do \u2013 you might end up with an obese and unhappy pooch. And that is never good. In the end, German Shepherds are certainly not the largest dogs you\u2019ll ever see, but they\u2019re big and strong enough to intimidate many people \u2013 even if they\u2019re acting perfectly friendly. Of course, their size and weight combined will make them strong, meaning that they can have quite a pull when you are walking them.  German Shepherds can make great pets \u2013 and that is one of the key reasons why they are so popular in the United States. But they can also have an aggressive and even protective side. It\u2019s important to never forget that. Still, the patience of this breed is well known \u2013 it can take quite a lot for its boundaries to get crossed.  This breed is not afraid to bite small dogs and are known as potential biters of people, as well. There are a large number of German Shepherd attacks, but at the same time, the popularity of the breed itself is a major contributing factor for those numbers, so keep that in mind. Also, the tendency of a German Shepherd to bite can be directly related to lack of training or proper attention from the owner \u2013 if you raise your doggo properly, they are certain to be calm and composed. A psychologically healthy Shepherd will be a self-confident, energetic and active animal \u2013 great for people who love to take their dogs out to exercise. German Shepherds are entirely capable of bonding with younger children as long as they are familiar with them. This is why early training and socialization is so important. These dogs have to be raised right in order to thrive with humans. German Shepherds can frequently suffer from joint problems, including arthritis. Since they are large dogs, German Shepherds can also be dogs with a higher chance of experiencing bloating. One disease to watch out for is the internal bleeding disease known as Von Willebrand disease, an inherited disorder that has a higher rate among German Shepherds. Since this disease can be inherited, it\u2019s a good idea to check your German Shepherd\u2019s pedigree. It\u2019s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a veterinarian (especially as your pooch ages into its senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as quickly as possible. This is a sponsored placement Seresto 8 Month Flea & Tick Prevention Collar for Large Dogs  Another way to keep your German Shepherd at his best is by protecting him against parasitic diseases and other manifestations of allergies with a pest control collar, such as Seresto 8 Month Flea & Tick Prevention Collar for Large Dogs.

With this mid to high range lifespan, and their lovely temperament, these dogs can be great companions \u2013 and friends for a big part of your life.  As mentioned earlier, German Shepherds can be a highly active breed, which means they have a high tolerance (and therefore elevated need) for exercise. With this higher level of activity also comes the aforementioned healthy appetite. German Shepherds make good exercise companions, especially if you have a large backyard that you can keep to yourself and your family. Exercise is also a great way to help children bond with a dog like the German Shepherd, which is known for its loyalty once it makes these bonds. It\u2019s important that German Shepherds end up with owners who are able to keep up with their rather intensive exercise demands. If these dogs don\u2019t burn off enough energy through exercise every day, they will find other far less pleasant ways of burning off their excess energy.

Loyal and athletic, the German Shorthaired Pointer is best when it\u2019s active. As you would suspect from its name, German Shorthaired Pointers originally came from Germany (shocking, we know!). They were developed during the 1600s and since then, this pointing and hunting dog has become one of the most versatile of all hunting breeds. German hunters wanted an all-purpose utility dog that had a good nose and could also point, track, and retrieve. On top of all that, they also wanted a good family companion and watchdog for when they weren\u2019t hunting. The result is the German Shorthaired Pointer we see today. A hunting dog that also fits in well at home. It is hard to tell what the exact heritage of the German Shorthaired Pointer actually is. Many think that the German Shorthaired Pointer is the result of different types of German hunting, scent hounds, trail and track dogs. These include the Old Spanish Pointer, German Bird Dog, Hounds of St. Hubert (Bloodhound types), and our old friend the Foxhound. Eventually, the English Pointer was crossed in to add an extra burst of speed and endurance. How this all came together is unclear, but the results are undeniable. The German Shorthaired Pointer was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1930. It has been a regular show dog ever since. A well-balanced and healthy diet will promote good health, a better-looking coat and ensure the general well being of your pet. German Shorthaired Pointers do best on high-quality dry food for dogs.

Additionally, you might want to feed your pet a raw or B.A.R.F diet or cook them meals at home. Unless this is an occasional treat to switch things up when your dog gets fed up with crunchy kibble, it\u2019s best to contact a professional for advice. A veterinarian will be able to tell you if these alternative diets are a good fit for your dog- and if their nutritional needs are being met. Since the German Shorthaired Pointer is known to have bloating issues, try to feed your dog two or three small meals per day instead of one large one.\n If you are in any way concerned about what you are feeding your German Shorthaired Pointer, then it is always wise to consult with a veterinarian. While pet food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, these don\u2019t always apply to every dog. All dogs are different after all, each with their own intricacies and needs. Only an experienced vet can accurately determine the dietary needs of your personal pooch. Always rely on your vet for the best advice about what food to put in your pet\u2019s dish!

An assertive person with a firm, yet caring hand will get the best results out of training this breed. Avoid aversive and cruel methods of training as they\u2019re not efficient and they damage the relationship of a dog and its owner (these methods are closer to abuse than training). Instead, use treats and praise to reward your dog\u2019s good behavior or learning progress. Positive reinforcement training has proved to be the best strategy. This is true when training any dog, but especially true when it comes to a smart and stubborn dog like the German Shorthaired Pointer.  While your dog is still in its puppyhood, start with the essentials. Potty training, leash training, and basic commands are a good place to begin your training regime. As your puppy learns about proper behavior, make sure to include socialization as well. Teach them how to act around kids, strangers, and other dogs while they\u2019re young, and you\u2019ll have a sweet, friendly pet in the long run. While it is possible to curb problematic behavior in a dog later on, it\u2019s always best to set the right standards while they are still young and impressionable puppies. Since this is a high-prey drive breed, they might not be the best choice for families with cats and smaller pets, even if socialized on time. It\u2019s simply not in their nature to share a home with another furry friend.  Additionally, you should expect even more training if you plan to use this dog for hunting purposes. This requires additional effort, time, and knowledge about dog training than the basics. So don\u2019t be go thinking just anyone can do it. This is for experienced owners or professional trainers only.  The German Shorthaired Pointer is not the best choice for a beginner dog owner.

It may have become famous for its hunting skills, but the German Shorthaired Pointer also makes a great pet, thanks to its loveable demeanor.  Dedicated to its owners, this breed will be sociable with other animals and humans. But the best part is that the German Shorthaired Pointer loves children \u2013 in fact, it will often become more attached to the children in the house than to the adults. So, the only potential issue with bringing a German Shorhaired Pointer home to your family is that you might get jealous of the bond that they form with your children!

The German Shorthaired Pointer has a few health concerns you need to watch out for. These include entropion, epilepsy, hermaphrodism, hip dysplasia, and skin disorders. It\u2019s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with your vet (especially as your dog ages into his senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible).

German Shorthaired Pointers have a life expectancy of 12 to 18 years, a very long lifespan for a dog.

Take your pooch on walks and runs every day (ideally totally in a full hour of walking time every day). And it\u2019s a great excuse to get the family out on a hike or camping trip \u2013 it\u2019s the perfect way for your dog to run around and spend some of its energy.

Though it was developed as a hunting dog, this breed is highly adaptable to different living situations as long as his needs for exercise are met. Even so, his primary purpose is to work as a gun dog hunting upland game. The German Spaniel is a hunting breed known for its thick, wavy coat and its friendly temperament. Developed in the 1890s, the German Spaniel is a German hunting breed created by breeder Frederick Roberth. Though a number of breeds were used in development, the most notable is the now-extinct Stoeberer. With early mentions dating back to 1719, the Stoeberer had the nose of a Bloodhound but Roberth wanted to create a breed that was much more versatile. Using the Stoeberer and various water dogs and sporting spaniels, he eventually created what is now known as the German Spaniel. The German Spaniel was first recognized as a breed in 1903 and the German breed club, the Verein fur Deutsche Wachtelhund, was established. Breed development continued but the German Spaniel wasn\u2019t introduced in the United States until the 1960s and 70s. The German Spaniel has yet to be recognized by the AKC but it has been admitted into the Foundation Stock Service and was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1996. Current estimates place about 100 German Spaniels in North America, so it is still a fairly rare breed outside of Germany. The German Spaniel is descended from the now-extinct Stoeberer which was crossed with various water dogs and spaniels during breed development. As a medium-sized dog, the German Spaniel should be fed a high-quality dry food that is formulated for adult dogs, though some dogs may cross the 50-pound border to become a large-breed dog. Because this breed was developed specifically for hunting, he may also do well on an active or working breed formula.

These dogs are generally friendly toward other dogs and people, plus they are highly adaptable to new situations and courageous in the field. This breed fulfills a variety of roles as a gun dog, capable of hunting, tracking, and retrieving. The German Spaniel loves his work and can be an aggressive hunter, so training may be necessary to control his instincts if you plan to keep him as a family pet. These dogs need a firm and consistent hand in leadership when it comes to training, though they may not respond well to harsh training methods. Positive reinforcement training is recommended. The German Spaniel walks the line between being a medium-sized and a large-breed dog, standing between 18 and 21 inches tall and weighing between 40 and 55 pounds at maturity. The German Spaniel is a friendly and sociable breed that gets along with most dogs and people. These dogs can become focused on their job in the field but they also enjoy spending time with family. This breed is intelligent and easy to train, but he still requires a strong leader in the household and plenty of exercise to prevent the development of problem behaviors. These dogs adapt well to new situations as well. The German Spaniel is a healthy breed in general, though all dogs are prone to certain health problems. Aside from field injuries, this breed may be affected by conditions such as hip dysplasia, ear infections, skin conditions, and allergies. The average lifespan for the German Spaniel is thought to be about 12 to 14 years which is about average for a breed of its size.

The texture of the coat is fine on the head but it is longer on the body. The body has a thick undercoat for protection from the elements and there is usually plenty of feathering as well. The most common color for the breed is a dark brown or a brown roan color. Many dogs have white markings on the chest or legs and some exhibit lighter shades of red.

The playful, animated Boxer gentle, sweet-natured Golden Retriever and the loyal, protective Chow. The positive side to this type of mix is that you get a loyal family dog that gets along well with kids and other pets once socialized and is up for all sorts of activity. The challenge can be that you have 3 highly diverse personalities and with any mix of breeds, there is potential to get a dog with a few of the less than ideal personality quirks that require a little extra training and attention. The Golden Chow Box will most certainly be a great watchdog because of his loyal, protective nature as well as a highly active dog given the Retriever and Boxer in him. This dog will also thrive on human companionship \u2013 which can become problematic if he\u2019s left on his own for long periods of time because he can be prone to separation anxiety. The Golden Chow Box brings together three of North America\u2019s favorite breeds; the Golden Retriever, the Chow and the Boxer. The Golden Chow Box is classed as a Designer Dog \u2013 a term that first became popular back in the 1980s and refers to the crossing of two or more pure-breds in order to arrive at a dog that is healthier, often non-shedding, smaller or gentler than many of the popular breeds of the day. With the Golden Chow Box, his parent breeds are the Boxer (typically 50% of the DNA), the Golden Retriever (25%) and Chow (25%) and in spite of his more recent designer breed status, he hales from parent breeds with some pretty impressive history. The Boxer dates to late 19th century Germany where he was bred for hunting before moving to America where he found his true calling in World War I performing active duty as a guard and messenger dog. The Chow is said to hale from northern China where he was used to guard ancient temples almost 2,000 years ago while the Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland back in the mid-1800s as a solution to the need for a dog that was adept at retrieving downed waterfowl on both land and in water. With the American Kennel Club (AKC) committed to promoting pure-bred dogs over mixed breeds, a Designer Dog such as the Golden Chow Box just isn\u2019t going to qualify for registry in this highly coveted club. However, all three of this dog\u2019s parent breeds are long time AKC members who have also proven to be highly popular breeds throughout North America. The Boxer became a member of the club\u2019s \u201cworking\u201d group back in 1904 and is described as brave, smart and active while the Golden Retriever was inducted back in 1925 to the \u201csporting\u201d group and is considered a friendly, intelligent and devoted dog. The Chow became a member of the \u201cnon-sporting\u201d group in 1903 and he\u2019s said to be a dignified, bright and serious-minded pooch. A nutrient-rich diet that is designed to meet his physical needs including size, age and activity level is important for every dog. With your Golden Chow Box being an active dog, you\u2019ll want to ensure his diet is rich in proteins that keep him feeling satisfied and don\u2019t leave him feeling hungry throughout the day. As both the Boxer and Chow in him may be prone to bloat, meals should always be smaller and served 2 to 3 times throughout the day versus allowing him to free-feed or giving him large volumes of food all at once. Exercise should also not be planned for sooner than 1 hour after feeding. This dog may be prone to joint issues later in life which means you need to establish and work at maintaining his ideal weight throughout life. The Golden Chow Box is a great family dog who once socialized, gets along well with kids, other pets and dogs. Although dogs that come from intelligent breeds can be quick to pick up and obey commands, they can also have a mind of their own and be a handful when it comes to training. Add in the stubborn personality of a Chow dog and you\u2019re going to need patience to bring out the best in this dog. It\u2019s important that socialization become an important part of the training process and with the Golden Chow Box this should begin when he is very young by exposing him to new people, places and situations including training classes for puppies. This will help ensure his comfort in different situations and with new experiences. As with most dogs, the Golden Chow Box will give you his very best when he\u2019s trained using a positive, rewards-based approach that ensures he gets lots of treats, appreciative pats and verbal praise each time he accomplishes a task. Because the Retriever in this boy brings an eager-to-please personality, training where he has the chance to show you he can pick up and respond to your commands (with you cheering him on) will go a long way in building a positive bond between you and your pooch. When your Golden Chow Box has reached maturity, you can expect him to weigh somewhere between 55 and 65 pounds depending on gender and which of the three sides of the DNA pool his genes lean toward.  The Golden Chow Box is a great family dog who once socialized, gets along well with kids, other pets and dogs. He will almost certainly take on the cautious, careful personality of the Boxer and protective nature of the Chow when it comes to strangers and this makes him a great watchdog who will readily bark to alert his human pack to perceived danger however training will be required to ensure he does not become aggressive. This pooch just thrives on human interaction and considers himself to be an integral part of all family activities. His need to be with people can become problematic if he\u2019s left on his own for long periods of time as he is prone to separation anxiety and can take on destructive behaviors such as chewing or continual barking. Similarly, if he doesn\u2019t receive regular daily exercise and his much-needed interactive playtime to help him burn off a little energy, he can become bored, restless and act out. Because this is an intelligent dog, consider buying him some puzzle toys that will help keep him occupied and challenge his problem-solving skills. Although Designer Dogs are typically free of many of the health issues that plague their pure-bred parents, it\u2019s always wise to do a little research into the types of problems your new pup may inherit down the line. Particularly when there are three different breeds involved. With the Golden Chow Box, that can include heart disease and certain cancers from both the Retriever and Boxer as well as joint issues such as dysplasia from all three breeds. Chows can also experience digestive issues including bloat. While this list may seem daunting, the Golden Chow Box is still considered a healthy dog breed and it\u2019s quite possible your pet will never experience these concerns in the course of his lifetime. With a regular exercise regimen, a top-quality food suited to his size, age and activity level plus regular preventative maintenance check-ups with your vet, you can expect your Golden Chow Box to live between 10 and 12 years; which is about average for a larger medium-sized dog. One-on-one exercise is a great way to bond with your Golden Chow Box and this can range from throwing a ball in the yard, taking him on a long walk or including him in your running or jogging activities \u2013 all important for his physical and mental health. While this is typically an active dog, if the Chow in him dominates, you may need to give him a nudge to get him started, however once up and moving, he\u2019ll be just fine. Although his walks should be of the longer variety (around 1 hour), expect to adjust this schedule in warmer weather as Chow\u2019s do not do well in the heat. Shorter walks or activities in a shaded yard are ideal when temperatures rise. Playtime that includes running and agility games such as catching a frisbee or chasing a ball are also a great way to change-up his routine. Visits to an off-leash dog park are another way for him to burn off some energy, engage with other dogs and brush up on his socialization skills. Meeting his exercise needs will help prevent him from developing behavioral issues such as chewing and barking. The Golden Chow Box thrives on human interaction and doesn\u2019t do well when left on his own for long periods. The Golden Chow Box is the offspring of three different pure-bred dogs and because of this he doesn\u2019t qualify to join the roster of the American Kennel Club (AKC) who are dedicated solely to individual pure-bred lines. At this time, he is not recognized by any of the lesser known clubs. While your Golden Chow Box may inherit the shorter, thin coat of the Boxer it\u2019s more likely you\u2019re going to see the long silky double-coat of the Retriever and / or the super thick, plush coat of the Chow. Whichever DNA dominates, you can expect a \u201cfull\u201d coat that will require brushing 3 to 4 times per week (with specific attention paid to his thick under-coat) to keep his hair from becoming matted or tangled \u2013 particularly around his head and ruff \u2013 and prevent loose hair from becoming a problem in your home, your vehicle and on your clothing. Because Chow\u2019s can be prone to skin conditions, it\u2019s important that if your dog inherits the profuse double-coat of the Chow that he be visually inspected periodically for signs of skin irritations and always fully dried after bathing (or swimming) to prevent potential fungal infections. And because floppy-eared dogs are prone to smelly yeast infections, a weekly ear inspection and simple cleaning that uses damp cotton balls will be needed to help remove dirt and prevent issues down the line. The Golden Chow Box can be expected to have a litter of between 6 and 8 good sized puppies that do well with gentle handling from the time they arrive. These pups bring the DNA from three highly intelligent breeds that, while friendly and loving, can also be stubborn and cautious around strangers. For that reason, plan to socialize early by introducing this pup to new faces, the experience of being handled and the smells and sounds of other animals. Begin when they are just a few weeks old (with mom\u2019s approval) by slowly building up the pup\u2019s confidence with new, positive and controlled experiences. This little guy can be prone to joint issues and digestive problems such as bloat later in life, so ensure playtime and exercise don\u2019t over-exert tiny limbs and that he begins a feeding regimen of smaller meals throughout the day versus allowing him to free-feed.

When it comes to the perfect family dog, it\u2019s hard to go wrong with a Golden Retriever. Used as working and hunting dogs, the Golden Retriever breed originated in Scotland in the mid-18th century, where it would hunt and retrieve small felled game during hunting trips. These dogs even developed water-repellent coats and webbed feet to help them retrieve waterfowl. These days, the Golden Retriever doesn\u2019t hunt as much as it used to, but it still retains the skills that made in a successful hunter. Often referred to as Gold Retriever and Golden Labrador Retriever, it should be noted that Golden Retriever is a distinct breed from the Labrador. Believed to have descended from the black wavy-coated Retriever, the Golden Retriever can also trace elements of the Newfoundland, Setter and Spaniel. Toward the end of the 19th century, Lord Tweedmouth improved the breed in order to create a superb retriever suited to the Scottish climate, terrain and game. Later, the breed attracted much attention when it was first shown in 1908. There\u2019s also a legend that has it that the Golden Retriever originates from eight Russian Sheepdogs that performed in a circus troupe\u2026 but there is no historical evidence to back this claim. The Golden Retriever was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1925. Meals for Golden Retrievers should consist of a proper balance of protein, carbohydrates, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. If you are going with a premium line of dog food, stay away from those with rich ingredients \u2013 Golden Retrievers don\u2019t handle this kind of food well. If your Golden Retriever has digestive issues, try a lamb and rice dog food. And when choosing a dog food, lean toward those that come with a high-quality source of protein with no fillers or artificial preservatives.\n Obedient, good-natured, intelligent, eager to please and eager to learn, the Golden Retriever is also known for its friskiness The Golden Retriever is a pleasure to train. This breed is easily trained and loves to learn new tricks. Golden Retrievers want to please its owner, so they will work hard at being obedient and loyal. Because Golden Retrievers are so active, you\u2019ll want to use the training sessions to expend some of this energy. The ideal weight for a Golden Retriever is 55 to 75 pounds. If your Golden Retriever is active, it should have no problems staying within this weight limit. Very loyal and sociable, the Golden Retriever loves interacting with humans and having fun. They make great pets for families with children and are not prone to attacking visitors (except with kisses!). They are also great with other animals too, even with those which are smaller than them, unlike other hunting breeds. They are calm and well-mannered and can also make good watchdogs. Golden Retrievers enjoy playing games, including fetch and playing with toys. They love to interact with humans in this way and can be great fun to be around. Leaving them alone for extended periods of time will make them unhappy. The breed is also highly intelligent, quick to learn and loves plenty of exercise and attention. Golden Retrievers are susceptible to a variety of ailments, so any signs of illness or changes in behavior should be taken seriously. Some of the most common conditions affecting Golden Retrievers include cataracts, elbow dysplasia, epilepsy, hip dysplasia, heart disease and skin allergies. Golden Retrievers have a life expectancy of 10 to 13 years, not uncommon for a dog this size. You\u2019ll find that since Golden Retrievers are an athletic breed, they will need plenty of exercise in order to be healthy and content.

The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cThe Golden Retriever, with its intelligence and eager to please attitude, is one of the most popular breeds in the United States according to AKC registration statistics. The working ability that has made the Golden Retriever such a useful hunting companion also make him an ideal guide, assistance and search and rescue dog.\u201d Since Golden Retrievers have long hair and a double coat, they shed quite a bit. It also means you\u2019ll need to brush it daily to avoid matting. And because these dog love swimming in lakes, ponds and streams, you\u2019ll have to bathe your Golden Retriever frequently.

Having been officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1884, it is far ahead of many modern breeds that could be considered more popular. Today, a Gordon Setter is known as an excellent, loyal, and obedient breed that looks great with a properly-groomed coat but is also an ideal exercise partner and friend in the outdoors. As part of the Irish Setter\u2019s pedigree, it\u2019s hard to deny that the Gordon Setter has had a long, rich history of pleasing owners and hunters. But today, the breed can also be considered an ideal companion even if you don\u2019t have any birds for it to sniff out \u2013 they are friendly, energetic, and respond well to training. If there\u2019s ever a dog that exemplified the phrase \u201cman\u2019s best friend,\u201d the Gordon Setter would have to be considered one of the leading contenders. Here\u2019s more information about this strong, historical breed. The Gordon Setter can be an ideal companion even if you don\u2019t have any birds for it to sniff out \u2013 it is friendly, energetic, and respond well to training. It should be noted that many other dogs similar to the Gordon Setter have actually not retained its heritage like the Gordon Setter has. In the early 19th century, this breed became popular thanks to help from Duke Alexander, the fourth of Gordon, and continued to make its mark as a popular hunting breed with strong scent-sniffing instincts. Able and willing to please, the breed was brought over to America, as well, where it also found popularity enough to be recognized by the American Kennel Club long before the 20th century. With its strong hunter\u2019s instincts and excellent companionship, they have enjoyed a relatively stable history as a breed, including their adherence to a \u201cblack-and-tan\u201d coat that is considered perhaps its strongest trademark. Interestingly enough, the Irish Setter takes its pedigree in the Gordon Setter, giving it an across-the-sea lineage that some Irish breeders might not always like to admit. The Gordon Setter\u2019s own pedigree comes from the hunting dogs of its day, which includes some of the popular breeds in the 17th and 18th century, as the Gordon Setter developed into its modern form. The dog eventually became more popular than many pointers, helping aid the strength of its pedigree as it spread to other continents like North America, which helps explain its popularity in the United States today. A good, healthy diet with an aim at providing a healthy coat should be provided. Meats, including poultry \u2013 remember, this is a bird-seeker \u2013 and other cuts like beef and lamb can be provided to provide protein, nutrition, and flavor to many meals. These dogs are renowned for their obedience and willingness to please. These dogs are renowned for their obedience and willingness to please, and its strong instinct for scent should be taken advantage of when these dogs are taken outdoors. They love a good task to complete and are great retrievers. As for the day-to-day training of a Gordon Setter, it should be properly socialized and given good discipline like any other breed, with an aim at making it kind to other animals. This breed typically weighs 45-80 pounds, with females on the lower end and males on the higher end. Because there\u2019s a lot of weight fluctuation between dogs, don\u2019t be alarmed if you have a relatively large or small Gordon Setter. Very loyal and friendly, this dog will get along with children and provide good companionship in a household, although they can be a little wary of strangers and aren\u2019t always confident around new people. They can therefore be a bit distant with strangers. But once they see themselves as part of your pack, they will feel at home and willing to please.  Prone to eye diseases common to dogs, such as cataracts, the Gordon Setter is an otherwise healthy dog that probably won\u2019t require too many trips to the veterinarian. This is good if you\u2019re in the market for a breed that is generally healthy. Expect this dog to live around 10 to 12 years. These are voracious exercisers and will require plenty of it to keep from bouncing around the walls indoors. For this reason, it\u2019s not recommended that you keep a Gordon Setter as a city pet. They\u2019re more suited for plenty of space to have their \u201coutdoor\u201d itch scratched on a daily basis, and they generally require plenty of activity to feel calm at the end of a day. Loyal and friendly, the Gordon Setter will get along with children and provide wonderful companionship in a household Says the American Kennel Club, a longtime recognizer of this breed: \u201cThe heaviest of the three setter breeds, the Gordon Setter was originally bred as a personal bird dog, but they are equally at home as companion dogs, obedience competitors and show dogs today. Sturdy and muscular, the Gordon suggests strength and stamina rather than extreme speed while on the move.\u201d There will be some grooming required, but not a lot. Regular brushing/combing is encouraged, as is checking for burrs and tangles, and giving them a bath from time to time is not a bad idea, but not always required. The coat itself can be quite long and distinctive, with strong tan and black colors that make it an instantly-recognizable breed. A good healthy coat on this dog will be very attractive and will attract a lot of people who want to pet it. These puppies should be given the normal discipline and routine as any dog puppies, especially if you have cats or other pets around your home. Ensuring a proper mentality as an adult begins when a dog is a puppy, so be sure to set proper boundaries, establish routines, and to correct a dog when it crosses certain lines.

Although Great Danes can trace their roots back to ancient times, a Great Dane as we know it today bears resemblance to breeds like the Irish Wolfhound and the English Mastiff.

In the 1200s, Sir Elias de Midhope developed the breed. It is considered to be one of the oldest English breeds of dog. Ever since then, Harriers were kept in packs for hunting hare in the English countryside. Harriers were slower than the Beagle. This made them more favorable when hunting the bigger and slower European Hare. One of the oldest of the English hunting dogs, it is believed that the Harrier was developed through careful breeding of the Old Southern Hound with various Greyhounds and Fox Terriers. In the 1820s, the Harrier was then bred to Foxhounds to increase the dogs\u2019 speed as well as give him the ability to be a dual hunter of both hare and fox. Today, the Harrier is just as happy being in the field as he is sleeping in a bed. Harriers are high-energy dogs and they need a quality diet specifically designed to meet their nutritional needs.

Over the centuries, with some careful interbreeding, the charming Havanese that we know and love today has emerged.  In the 1970s, when many Cubans had to flee their country, their Havanese pets were often by their side. In the end, several families from Cuba brought their Havanese to the US, where the breed gradually gained a foothold and became recognized.

The Hovawart\u2019s history begins in the Harz and Black Forest regions of Germany where it was bred as a dedicated guard dog. One of the first documented recordings of a Hovawart comes from the early 1200\u2019s when the Ordensritterburg castle of Germany was invaded by Slavic invaders. The story goes that the castle was torched to the ground and all its inhabitants were slaughtered; except for the infant son of the castle lord. The infant was saved by one of the castle\u2019s Hovawarts that, despite being injured itself, dragged the youngster to a neighboring castle and to safety. The boy named Eike von Repkow grew up to be one of the most notable figures in German law. Although the Howavart had earned itself a place in German culture and history, its popularity started to decline towards the early 20th century as breeds like the German Shepherd grew in popularity. In 1915, a group of Hovawart enthusiasts led by a zoologist named Kurt Friedrich K\u00f6nig started a concentrated effort to resurrect the breed. They started off by looking for dogs that fit the Hovawart\u2019s description in the farms of the Black Forest region and then crossing them to various other breeds. Their efforts bore fruit when the first Hovawart litter was entered into the German Breeding Registry in 1922. However, the breeders\u2019 hard work was almost all for naught as the Hovawart was all but wiped out during the outbreak of World War II. Due to its exceptional abilities the breed was used in the German military and thousands perished during the war. After World War II drew to a close, a breeder named Otto Schramm and a group of fellow Hovawart enthusiasts worked hard to preserve the breed and formed a new breed club. It is believed that in the process of creating the modern Hovawart, they were crossed with various breeds such as Newfoundlands, German Shepherds and Leonbergers, as well as a Bernese Mountain Dog and an African Hunting Dog. Hovawarts are hard workers and need a well-balanced diet. They can be fed on most high-grade dry foods.

Oak Tree\u2019s Irishtocrat in 1979! Often confused for a large and pampered Poodle, the Irish Water Spaniel is nothing of the sort. He is a formidable hunter, pointer, swimmer and retriever as well as an awesome family companion. The Irish Water Spaniel has such a friendly and inquisitive outlook on life that he tends to be quite the source of entertainment for all who are around him. Toys thrown across the yard will immediately have him off running but\u2026 if a butterfly flutters by, he will stop for a second and seemingly enjoy its beauty.

For more information about the Irish Water Spaniel, read on. Nicknamed the clever clown dog, the Irish Water Spaniel is fun-loving and mischievous. Many people debate the true origin of the Irish Water Spaniel however; there is no doubt that its perfection occurred in Ireland. In the 1830s, Justin McCarthy owned a kennel which is considered to be the start of this wonderful breed. His dog that was called Boatswain is believed to be the father of what we all would consider the modern day Irish Water Spaniel. Even in the early 1800s, these great dogs were prized for their hunting skills and agility as well as their good nature living within a family. Because Justin McCarthy died without revealing exactly how he created the Irish Water Spaniel, the true combination of breeds will never be known. People have speculated that the French Poodle called the Barbet could have been bred with a Portuguese Water Dog to create this incredible breed. It must also be taken into consideration that there were two styles of water spaniels known to be in Ireland at that time. The whole point is moot because McCarthy never revealed his secret and when he passed away, he took all of the information about the creation of the breed with him. It is essential that all owners of Irish Water Spaniels understand that these are high energy dogs.

This breed can become mischievous so regular training sessions can be beneficial. One of the best things about this breed is that the Irish Water Spaniels are not barkers.

Because the Irish Water Spaniel has a unique outlook on life, he tends to be extremely watchful and cautious around strangers. This doesn\u2019t always equate to a problem with timidity. A well-socialized puppy that has been exposed to a variety of people, situations, noises and events will still be a bit cautious when a new person or thing shows up in the home or his surroundings. It is in his nature to evaluate the situation and eventually approach the newcomer or new situation. Again, this is not being timid; this is being watchful and is a sought after trait within the breed. A generally healthy breed, the Irish Water Spaniel is still predisposed to health issues. Hip dysplasia is one that breeders have been trying to eliminate for years but it can also be triggered by a dog\u2019s environment. Playing, falling or jumping on slippery tile floors can increase the puppy\u2019s risk of being diagnosed with hip dysplasia, as can excessive weight gain in a short period of time, obesity and over exertion. Cataracts can affect any older canine however; Juvenile Cataracts have been diagnosed within the breed. Dogs between the ages of 2 and 4 years of age might exhibit signs of hair loss. This may be attributed to Follicular Dysplasia. It does not create any true health issues provided the owner covers the hairless areas with sunscreen. Unfortunately, the coat loss is permanent. Irish Water Spaniels are also predisposed to Hypothyroidism, a treatable hormonal disorder. Entropion, Paronychia, Distichiasis and Epilepsy can also be found within the breed. Megaesophagus is a problem occasionally presented by owners of Irish Water Spaniels. Unfortunately, there is no cure and the morbidity rate is quite high. This breed can be highly sensitive to vaccines and other medications. Great care should be given when pups are being vaccinated or treated for illness. With proper housing, exercise and veterinary care, an Irish Water Spaniel should live between 10 and 12 years. Irish Water Spaniels are bundles of energy and quite athletic by genetics. They thrive when they are able to run, play, chase down game and retrieve fowl. They are not at all happy leading sedentary lives and can become destructive without regular activities that will enthrall and exert them. They require at least an hour of playtime daily in order to keep them in tiptop shape. Of course, they love water so if you sit in your yard and have a hard plastic wading pool, they will happily retrieve dummies for hours. This is what makes Irish Water Spaniels awesome companions for families with sturdy kids. Because the Irish Water Spaniel has a unique outlook on life, he tends to be extremely watchful and cautious around strangers. According to the AKC, the Irish Water Spaniel is: \u201cSuitable for allergy sufferers, their hypoallergenic coats require brushing every few weeks and trimming every two months to neaten and shape the coat.\u201d This versatile breed was recognized by the AKC in 1884. A double coated breed, the Irish Water Spaniel has tight ringlets of curls that cover his back, sides and rear end. Longer curls cover the legs and undercarriage of the dog. The face, front portion of the neck, toes and tail is covered in short hair. Every Irish Water Spaniel is liver in color and without any white markings, other than graying due to advanced age. Because Irish Water Spaniels shed little coat, it is absolutely essential that the owner brush the dog thoroughly at least three times a week. This will help to distribute the waterproofing oils through the coat as well as eliminate any tangles which could eventually cause matting. Irish Water Spaniel puppies are as cute as can be but without proper attention, training and exercise, they can become nightmares. They must be socialized and they crave attention from their human families. These great dogs require time, exercise and lots of love from their owners.

But there\u2019s more to the story here. Raising a Japanese Chin to have a healthy personality means just as much training and effort as any other dog. Don\u2019t use its smaller stature as an excuse for less maintenance. If you\u2019re patient, the rewards can be great: a cute, bubbly breed of dog that reminds us that not every single classic breed comes from the United States or Europe. The Japanese Chin can be cute, friendly, and even a little frisky. Like the Pug, a similar-looking and Asian-originated breed, the Japanese Chin has a history that predates many of the breeds we\u2019d consider to be \u201cclassic\u201d today. Although the first origins of the Japanese Chin are subject to some controversy, there\u2019s evidence that it actually originated in China and developed into its more advanced form in Japan. This occurred around the 8th and 9th century A.D., although some history suggests that the true development of this breed occurred around 1,000 A.D. Bred as lap and toy dogs, the Japanese Chin has had a relatively easy life, and that pedigree shines through in their demeanor even today. They are considered to have some of the most \u201ccat-like\u201d personalities in the entire world of dogs, meaning that they\u2019re not exactly hunting or working dogs. The history of this breed suggests that the Japanese Chin is definitely a domestic breed that should be able to adapt to just about any home, provided proper training. Although the early history of the Chin is obviously a bit muddled \u2013 and this leads us only to speculate on the precise pedigree of the Chin \u2013 we do have an idea that the Chin originated in China and took on many of its defining characteristics in Japan. Since the Chin resembles the Pug, we might even speculate on a potential relationship between the two Asian toy breeds \u2013 especially considering that both breeds have generally been bred for similar purposes. There is certainly a degree of resemblance between the two breeds. The Japanese Chin also added to its pedigree over the years, and is considered one of the most \u201croyal\u201d of dog breeds. This is because many people belonging to the Japanese nobility enjoyed having these dogs as lap dogs and companions. The difference between the personality of this dog and other dogs actually led to many Japanese people considering the Japanese Chin to be separate from \u201cdogs.\u201d Japanese Chin only grows to a weight of around 10 pounds, which means there\u2019s little wiggle room here. Eating too much can easily lead to a Japanese Chin adding more weight than it should have \u2013 keep in mind that one pound for a Japanese Chin is 10 percent of its normal body weight. For this reason, make sure you feed a diet full of healthy lean meats for your dog without allowing them to over-indulge. The Japanese Chin can be pretty independent and relatively friendly to strangers. Socializing your Chin early on as a puppy will be crucial in its development. It\u2019s a naturally social and friendly breed, so allowing it to grow up in this kind of environment means that it should be able to act on its instincts from an early age. Generally obedient and friendly, you shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble with this toy breed, though you never want to let any toy breed bully you. Coming in around 10 pounds at a normal weight, the light weight here means that an appropriately small diet should be the norm. Though Japanese Chins may look like they can eat a lot, that doesn\u2019t mean you should feed them that much. Considered one of the closest personalities to cats that exists in the dog world, these dogs can be pretty independent and relatively friendly to strangers. If you\u2019re a cat lover who\u2019s looking to compromise with a spouse on buying a dog, you might want to consider suggesting a Japanese Chin as a sort of middle ground. The Japanese Chin is generally friendly to people it knows, but like any dog it can be a bit hostile to strangers. Be sure to socialize your Chin early. Avoid keeping your dog in hot temperatures, as you would with many toy dogs. Its odd face can cause breathing problems, as you\u2019ll see in a few other toy breeds as well. The Japanese Chin lives for around 11 to 15 years. A generally minimal commitment to exercise: a daily walk should suffice for this breed. Socializing your Japanese Chin early on as a puppy will be crucial in its development. The American Kennel Club\u2019s description of the Japanese Chin highlights its personality and aristocratic heritage. The coat is one of the distinguishing features of the Japanese Chin. It can be grown long and soft, especially if it\u2019s a show dog, and will obviously require a heavy bit of maintenance to ensure that this coat remains clean. Generally these coats will be black and white. There have been Japanese Chins who have been white and red. Japanese Chins should get a healthy exposure to people to properly socialize it as it is being raised. This will help it to retain a friendly demeanor and general acceptance of strangers.

These little dogs are the ideal companion pet, often compared to the white Pomeranian. Japanese Spitz dogs are known for being active and loyal companions who become very devoted to their owners. What makes the Japanese Spitz such a great pet is the fact that this breed simply craves human attention. These little dogs will not be content to sit back and watch family activities \u2013 they want to be part of the action! Even though this is a fairly recent and rare breed, Japanese Spitz is a highly sought-after dog. The main reason for this is their winning combination of adorable, fluffy looks and a wonderful personality. These dogs are particularly recommended for families with children and for seniors looking for a low-maintenance pet. Japanese Spitz is also a fantastic choice for people living in an apartment, due to its compact size and minimal exercise needs.  Imagine a small white dog with a thick white coat and a fluffy tail \u2013 that is the image of a Japanese Spitz. The Japanese Spitz was developed in Japan during the 1920s and 30s by crossbreeding several Spitz-type breeds. It is thought that the breed started with German Spitz dogs bred to various small white Spitz-type breeds that were imported from around the world. The goal of the breeders was to produce a dog that would sport an attractive coat and have a personality that makes him a good companion for families.  The first Standard for the breed wasn\u2019t published in Japan until after World War II, after which point the breed began to gain popularity throughout Japan and into England. In 1977, the Japanese Spitz was accepted as a member of the Utility Group by the Kennel Club but it remains unrecognized by the AKC. The Japanese Spitz breed was developed by crossing several Spitz-type breeds together, including the German Spitz. After years of development, these Japanese breeders managed to create a standard for the small, white dog people now know and love. However, even though fairly popular throughout the world, these dogs are not so well-known in the United States. The main reason is their similarity to various other Spitz-type breeds, including the American Eskimo, which is also why they\u2019re not recognized by the American Kennel Club. In the US, smaller clubs recognize this breed, including American Canine Registry, American Canine Association, American Pet Registry, and Dog Registry of America. Even so, this will mean that your new puppy can\u2019t have an official pedigree- as Japanese Spitz is not eligible for registration with the AKC. Across the world, most national clubs recognize these dogs, from UK\u2019s Kennel Club to Canadian Kennel Club and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.  All dogs need a well-balanced, healthy diet to thrive and the Japanese Spitz is no different. Most experts agree that dry food has the most benefits for dogs, and the convenient form and ease of availability make it the most appealing option for owners, too. Naturally, not all dry foods are the same and not all of them will be a good choice for the Japanese Spitz.  Choose only premium quality kibble that\u2019s made from high-grade, healthy ingredients and that is suitable for your dog\u2019s age (puppy, adult, senior), size, and activity levels (mixes for small breed dogs usually cover for both). From time to time you can use kibble toppers such as wet canned food or cooked light meat with dog-safe veggies, but don\u2019t go overboard.  Japanese Spitz is a compact canine and will gain weight quickly. To prevent obesity, follow the serving size recommendations- usually, a cup to cup and a half of kibble are enough for a dog of this size. Additionally, you shouldn\u2019t free feed your pet, but rather split their daily dose of food into two separate meals. Japanese Spitz dogs are very intelligent and eager to please which makes them very adaptable to training. Japanese Spitz dogs are very intelligent and eager to please which makes them very adaptable to training. The key is to start training your dog early and to maintain consistency so your dog learns quickly and remembers your commands. In addition to obedience training, the Japanese Spitz is also a good candidate for agility training and various dog sports including Flyball. Like many small breeds, the Japanese Spitz is prone to developing behavioral problems if not properly trained or exercised. Training does more than just ensure that your dog follows your commands \u2013 it also gives your dog mental exercise to stave off boredom. If your dog becomes bored, he is more likely to develop behavioral problems like digging and chewing. The Japanese Spitz in particular is said to be a big dog in a little dog\u2019s body, so training is essential to keep your dog\u2019s big personality under control. The average weight of this breed is 11 to 20 lbs. (5-10kg).  The Japanese Spitz is a smart and loyal breed that gets along very well with children. However, even though these petite pooches will have patience with kids, make sure to your young ones how to behave around dogs: rough play could injure fragile Japanese Spitz puppies and pulling hair or being mean to a mature dog could lead to them developing behavioral issues. With proper training and socialization, though, Japanese Spitz is a fantastic companion. These little dogs crave human affection and will do anything they can to be included in family activities. Japanese Spitz dogs also make great watchdogs because they tend to bark when a stranger comes near, though they are quick to warm up to people when properly introduced. So, you might know when a stranger is coming by, but don\u2019t count on your ball of fluff to do anything about it- they would probably make friends with a burglar! Japanese Spitz dogs are active and playful which makes them ideal for active singles and families. If you are looking for a dog that will run and play with you outside, the Japanese Spitz will definitely fill that need. These dogs can be a little dominant or independent at times, but they can be very obedient with proper training. Responsible breeding practices can limit the occurrence of major health problems in this breed but some of the most common issues include patellar luxation and runny eyes or tear staining. Runny eyes are often caused by stress or allergies and can easily be treated by bathing the eye in warm water. The life expectancy of the Japanese Spitz breed is about 12-14 years. These little dogs are full of energy and can be very active. This being the case, you need to take your Japanese Spitz for a long walk on a daily basis. Anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise will be mandatory. They will love to go to dog parks for some furry friendly time or run around and fetch in a securely fenced backyard. Needless to say, their activity needs make Japanese Spitz is a lovely choice for a family living in a home with a yard. As long as your dog gets enough exercise, however, he will be perfectly happy living in an apartment or a house with limited outdoor space. It\u2019s the willingness of the owner to provide exercise that counts- not enough space for them to be active on their own. These little dogs crave human affection and will do anything they can to be included in family activities. The Japanese Spitz is not recognized by the American Kennel Club. The reason is its similarity to the white Pomeranian as well as the Samoyed and the American Eskimo Dog. The coat of the Japanese Spitz is its most recognizable feature \u2013 it is white and plush, forming a thick mane around the neck. The fur on the lower legs is shorter, but the tail is well-furred and is carried curled over the back. Due to the thickness of this breed\u2019s double coat, regular brushing and grooming is necessary to keep the coat healthy and to reduce shedding. Japanese Spitz puppies can be quite a handful since this breed is naturally active and energetic. It is important to start training your puppy early so your dog doesn\u2019t develop Small Dog Syndrome. Early training is also the key to ensuring that your puppy grows up to be obedient to your commands. Proper socialization is also important as it prevents dominant behavior towards other dogs and that encourages friendliness to people.", "facts": " Not Applicable Families with children, singles and seniors, apartments, houses with yards with/without yards Active, loyal, obedient, intelligent", "tags": "agility training, flyball, Japan, Japanese Spitz, obedience training, Patellar Luxation, "}, "kai ken": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/kai-ken/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kai-ken.jpg", "name": "Kai Ken", "type": "dog", "text": "If you picture a small dog with a dark coat, pointed ears and a fluffy tail, you have the image of a Kai Ken. These dogs hail from Japan where, even in their native land, they are still considered fairly rare. What makes these dogs unique is the tiger-like stripes that adorn their coats in various shades. There are two variations of the Kai Ken \u2013 the shishi-inu-gata type and the shika-inu-gata type. The former is known for its stockier body and bear-like face. The later was famed for deer hunting and is known for its longer, thinner body and foxlike face. Today, the Japanese do not distinguish between the two types as both played a significant role in the development of the breed. If you picture a small dog with a dark coat, pointed ears and a fluffy tail, you have the image of a Kai Ken. The modern Kai Ken is descendant from ancient Japanese dogs that lived in the mountain province of Kai. Due to the geographical isolation of this province, it is believed that the Kai Ken might be the purest of all Japanese dog breeds. Traditional Japanese writings identify the dog as a natural hunter, the master of its domain \u2013 the breed has been known to go to extremes in hunting game, going so far as to swim or even climb trees. The Kai Ken was recognized by the Japanese Kennel Club in 1934 and was first brought to the United States during the 1950s by service men in the military. It is unknown whether any of these original dogs survived but, during the 1990s, a young male and several female puppies were brought to the States \u2013 these dogs are the foundation stock of the modern American-bred Kai Ken. The Kai Ken is an ancient Japanese breed and may very well be the purest dog breed in Japan. Given that the Kai Ken is a naturally active breed, you should consider providing him with a dog food formulated for active dogs. These dogs are highly intelligent and respond very well to training, especially if it is started at an early age. Originally bred to hunt boar and deer, the Kai Ken makes a great hunting dog. These dogs are highly intelligent and respond very well to training, especially if it is started at an early age. This breed learns very quickly so, if you provide firm and consistent training you may be amazed at how much this dog can learn and retain. The Kai Ken is not as independent or strong-willed as some highly intelligent breeds \u2013 they have a natural desire to please their human companions. The average weight for this breed at maturity is between 30 and 50 pounds. An intelligent and active breed, the Kai Ken is also known for its friendly demeanor. This breed loves to be with its family and forms very close bonds with its human companions. They tend to get along well with children and typically are not aggressive toward other dogs. Given that the Kai is a hunting breed, it is best to introduce him to other pets early but he should have no trouble getting along. Kai dogs do tend to be reserved around strangers and they make very good watchdogs, likely to sound the alarm whenever necessary. Whether you train him for hunting or not, the Kai Ken makes a great family pet. Given the genetic purity of the breed, the Kai Ken is not known to have many congenital health problems. Like all dogs, however, the breed is prone to several minor health issues. The average lifespan of the Kai Ken breed is between 14 and 16 years. As a hunting breed, the Kai Ken is fairly active but the breed only has moderate needs for exercise. You will not need to take your dog out for hours every day \u2013 a long 30-minute walk or a brisk jog will be adequate. This breed is adaptable to apartment life and can get along without a yard as long as its daily exercise needs are met. Because this breed is so intelligent, it requires frequent mental exercise as well as physical exercise \u2013 plan to engage your dog in games often and consider agility training to keep him sharp and active. An intelligent and active breed, the Kai Ken is also known for its friendly demeanor. The Kai Ken has yet to be officially recognized by the AKC. Currently, the breed is in the Foundation Stock Service Program \u2013 once the number of registered Kai Ken dogs in the U.S. reaches 150, the breed will be fully accepted by the AKC. The Kai Ken has a harsh, medium-length coat with a furred tail that is carried over the back. Most specimens of the breed have a dark coat with various shades of brindle markings. Dogs with primarily black coloring are called Kuro-tora while red Kai Kens are called Aka-tora \u2013 the Chu-tora is somewhere in the middle. The Kai Ken is a very clean dog by nature so you won\u2019t have to worry about odor or frequent bathing. The breed\u2019s coat is easy to maintain, requiring only regular brushing to help control shedding. As puppies, Kai Kens are born with solid-colored coats but their brindle (tiger-stripe) markings develop over time.

This dog is easily recognized by its massive head, dark muzzle, and curled tail which is carried up and over the back. When viewed from the side, the Kangal has a very distinctive silhouette. It\u2019s no challenge to pick this dog out from a lineup, there aren\u2019t any pups out there quite like it. But don\u2019t let the Kangal Dog\u2019s imposing physique intimidate you. Appearances can be deceiving and this majestic breed is the true definition of a gentle giant. While they are alert and make ideal watchdogs or guard dogs, there\u2019s not an ounce of aggressiveness or viciousness in the Kangal Dog. These fierce guardians have a peaceful nature and serene demeanor. When push comes to shove, they would rather block the intruder than actually attack them, like some other guard dog breeds. This isn\u2019t a dog for anyone simply seeking protection. Nope, despite what you might think at first glance, the Kangal dog is more about love and protection than fear and intimidation.  Owing to the fact that, despite its massive size, the Kangal Dog is actually very calm and gentle, this breed is a good choice for a family pet. Not only do these dogs get along well with children, but they also watch over them. However, It goes without saying that you should only get a Kangal Dog if you have a space for one. These dogs need a lot of space, and a house with a big, securely fenced yard is the ideal setting for them. So, is The Kangal Dog the big burly boy that you need to bring home to your family? You\u2019ve come to the right place to find out. Keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away. We are about to reveal everything that there is to know about this beautiful breed. By the end, you\u2019ll know whether or not you need one of these big boys in your life. The Kangal Dog is a large and powerful breed, often used in Turkey to guard livestock against predators. Though there is some debate regarding the details of this breed\u2019s origins, the Kangal Dog is known to come from Turkey where it was used as an ancient flock-guarding breed. The Kangal is thought to have descended from various mastiff-type dogs such as those depicted in ancient Assyrian art. This breed gets its name from the Kangal District of Sivas Province in Turkey and this location is also likely where it originated. Throughout its history, the Kangal has been associated with the Aga of Kangal, a large family of landholders and chieftains that use the dogs to guard flocks against large predators such as bears, jackals and wolves. This breed\u2019s history as protectors is legendary. The first mention of the Kangal Dog in European literature during the late 1900s. In 1985, David and Judith Nelson brought their Kangal to the United States where it, along with other imports, served as the foundation stock for the Kangal Dog in the U.S. There continues to be some debate regarding whether the Kangal Dog is actually a separate breed from the Anatolian Shepherd, another Turkish breed. It is commonly accepted, however, that true Kangal Dogs are a separate breed from generic Turkish shepherd dogs. So, at least that statement carries no controversy.  Owing to the ongoing debate among canine experts if, in fact, there are enough differences between the Anatolian Shepherd Dog and the Kangal Dog for them to be separate breeds, there is some confusion about these dogs in the United States. The American Kennel Club recognizes Anatolian Shepherd, noting that this breed is \u201calso known as the Kangal\u201d. Their view of these remarkable dogs is they boast many qualities, most prominent being that they\u2019re  \u201csmart, devoted, responsive, and adaptable\u201d. Regardless of any pedigree certification, though, you can be certain that your Kangal puppy has admirable roots. The breed has quite a history, with some sources placing its origin as far back as 12th century (Something that perhaps the AKC should look into before making their rash decisions about the Kangal Dog).  Given the fact that the Kangal is a very large breed of dog, it is important that you provide a diet formulated for large-breed dogs. Their size requires much more nutrient-dense kibble than most options, and greater amounts of it than would satisfy most dogs as well. Ideally, you would feed your Kangal Dog a diet based on high-quality dry dog food. There are plenty of premium brands that cater to giant dog breeds and have kibble blends that meet their needs. Also, you\u2019ll need to make sure that the kibble you\u2019re getting is age-appropriate for your pet. A growing Kangal puppy has different needs than a senior dog, so it\u2019s important to take this into consideration before making a decision. If used as a working breed, you should also consider using a formula designed for active dogs. As always, if you are in any way concerned about altering or establishing your Kangal Dog\u2019s diet, then it\u2019s wise to consult with a veterinarian before making any major decisions. While most dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, they should still be treated as guidelines and not gospel. All dogs are different after all and only your vet is qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch. So, always rely on the expertise of your vet before making any major decisions regarding your pooch\u2019s diet. The Kangal Dog is smart and can be trained to guard livestock as well as property. The Kangal Dog is smart and can be trained to guard livestock as well as property. With firm and consistent training, Kangal Dogs will turn excel as both excellent watchdogs and loving companions. However, because these dogs can become independent and stubborn, it is important to start training from a young age. In most cases, Kangal Dogs are kept indoors (ideally with constant access to a securely fenced yard). This would mean that you need to housebreak your pet too. It might take some effort, but positive reinforcement methods yield great results (always focus on rewards and encouragement in your training as anything less is closer to abuse than training). Socialization might even be more important for a Kangal Dog. Even though they are calm and relatively docile by nature, the last thing you want is to have a huge dog that\u2019s not socialized properly. They need to be taught how to behave around children, strangers, and other dogs, to make sure their sweet disposition remains that way when they\u2019re older. It\u2019s important not to waste those early an impressionable days in your puppy\u2019s life, so start training and socialization as early as possible to ensure that you have a long and loving relationship with your Kangal Dog.  The average weight for a male Kangal Dog is between 110 and 145 pounds while females weigh between 90 and 120 pounds. In other words, he\u2019s a big boy! These dogs can often feel like they are closer to roommates that pets. Despite its size, the Kangal is a fairly calm and controlled breed. However, these dogs do tend to develop an independent streak if proper training and socialization is not achieved from a young age. So, it\u2019s important for anyone who owns these remarkable animals to treat their training and socialization relationship very seriously. Kangal Dogs are generally friendly with visitors and often get along very well with children. These dogs should never be shy or vicious, but they do tend to be very protective of their families. This breed was bred to guard livestock, so you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if you find your dog standing watch over your children or other pets. Because these dogs can be a handful at times, they are generally not recommended for inexperienced dog owners. It takes an experienced dog owner who takes their responsibilities seriously to raise these big and beautiful dogs right. The Kangal Dog is typically a healthy breed and, as long as they have been bred responsibly, they do not have many congenital conditions. Like all dogs, however, the Kangal Dog breed is prone to certain minor conditions including benign tumors, entropion and hip dysplasia. As always, it\u2019s important to maintain regular checkups (especially as your dog enters their senior years) so that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. The average lifespan for the Kangal Dog is between 12 and 15 years, which is quite impressive for a dog of this size. The Kangal Dog is a large dog and needs plenty of time to stretch its legs and work off its energy during the day. To boot, this breed was originally created to be a working dog, and they will need to occupy themselves with something to be content (ideally they can occupy themselves with watching over their family). So, if you want to get a Kangal Dog, be prepared to provide both mental and physical stimulation they crave. Working dogs of this breed usually get all their needs met through their jobs, but companions and pets will need to be deliberately exercised. While these dogs are not overly active, they will require outdoor space to roam about and guard. They\u2019ll also benefit from circa 60 minutes of daily walks or playtime with the owner. Despite its size, the Kangal Dog is a fairly calm and controlled breed. The Kangal Dog is not currently recognized by the AKC and it was only recognized by the UK Kennel Club in 2012 as part of the Pastoral Group. In the U.S., the Kangal Dog is recognized by the United Kennel Club. In Australia in 2012, the Australian National Kennel Club stopped recognizing the Kangal as a separate breed from the Anatolian Shepherd Dog. Hopefully one day the AKC will follow suit. The Kangal Dog has a short, dense coat that does not require a great deal of grooming. The coat is generally fawn or tan in color with a black facial mask and black shading on the ears. Some white markings may be allowed on the chest, chin or toes but the coat should not be spotted, brindled or broken. It is very important to start socialization and training right away with Kangal Dog puppies. These dogs require firm leadership and consistent training along with adequate socialization. Kangal Dog puppies tend to grow very quickly and they often develop a tendency to chew, so keep an eye on them. It\u2019s important to take your puppy parenting responsibilities seriously so that your Kangal Dog can grow into his best self.", "facts": " UKC Guardian  Homes with yards, families with older children, guard duty, farms/rural areas Calm, independent, protective, good with kids", "tags": "flock herding dog, guard dog, Kangal Dog, kid friendly dogs, shepherd dog, Turkey, "}, "kanni": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/kanni/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kanni-668x446.jpg", "name": "Kanni", "type": "dog", "text": "At first glance, you might think he\u2019s a Greyhound. In fact, the Kanni does look remarkably like one of those lithe coursing hounds, but the Kanni hails from South India where he is also known as the Maiden\u2019s Beastmaster. This breed is classified as a sighthound, though it is largely used for coursing game, and it is a royal indigenous breed seen exclusively in black-and-tan or black-and-sable combinations. The Kanni hails from South India where he is also known as the Maiden\u2019s Beastmaster. The name Kanni translates to \u201cpure\u201d in Tamil, and it is a name bestowed upon the breed for its loyalty and purity of heart. Also known as the Maiden\u2019s Beastmaster, this breed is a voracious defender of its territory against wild animals and has been traditionally given as a gift to newlywed brides for protection. Though these dogs come in two color combinations, only the black-and-tan version is allowed to carry the name Kanni \u2013 the black-and-sable variation is called Chippiparai. Though loyal to a fault, this breed is primarily used for hunting. The exact origins of the Kanni breed are unknown and it is unfortunately the case that the breed has become extremely rare and there are no current efforts in place to revive it. Traditionally, Kanni are fed milk for breakfast, corn porridge for lunch, and Ragi porridge at tea time. Meat is only given on a weekly or monthly basis. If you plan to keep this breed, however, it is recommended that you choose a high-quality adult dog formula (or an active or working breed formula) to ensure complete and balanced nutrition. As a sighthound, the Kanni is an intelligent and trainable breed. As a sighthound, the Kanni is an intelligent and trainable breed. You must consider, however, that these dogs were bred to work independently so you can expect your dog to be a little willful at times. These dogs are very territorial and loyal, however, so they can be trained for protection as well as hunting. It is best to start training and socialization from a very young age, especially because these dogs can become quite voracious when it comes to defending their territory and their people. The Kanni is a medium-sized breed, typically growing between 35 and 48 pounds. Males are a little larger than females, standing about 25 inches tall with females standing about 22 inches tall. Generally speaking, Kanni are shy dogs. When it comes to their family, however, they are extremely loyal and can be very protective. This breed is generally easy to train, but they are prone to independence, so you should expect your dog to exhibit a will of his own from time to time.

The exact origins of the breed are unknown, but it is thought to have existed for more than 3,000 years. These dogs were developed in the mountains of Ryushu where they were bred to hunt deer, wild boar, and sometimes bear. These dogs were trained to track and hold prey until the hunter arrived. Today, they are primarily used for hunting but can also be kept as a family pet with proper training and exercise. The breed is sometimes crossed with the Shikoku, a dog very similar in appearance, and he is very rare outside of Japan.

With his long, heavily-matted white coat, this dog blends right in with the sheep, so predators have no idea what\u2019s in store for them! But even if he\u2019s not guarding sheep, the Komondor is a wonderful companion for the right family. Also known as the Hungarian Komondor, the Hungarian Sheepdog and the Kom, this breed likes to be put to work. Whether it is guarding sheep or guarding your family, the Komondor is happy to be watching your back. He may look like a mop, but the Kom is known for his dignity, strength and courage. Even though this dog is generally reserved and serious with strangers, he\u2019ll be open to showing his love to his family. His coat takes some time and energy to care for, so this is not a breed for anyone looking for low-maintenance grooming. Read on to learn more about the Komondor. He may look like a mop, but the Komondor is known for his dignity, strength and courage. A staple on Hungarian farms, the Komondor was used by farmers to guard sheep. It would blend in with the sheep and protect them against wolves and other predators. Their coat let them blend in with the sheep and it provided protection against vicious predators. On top of that, their coat kept them warm in the winter and prevented sunburn in the summer. The Komondor was bred for centuries for its bravery, performance and courage. They were never cross-bred with other dog, but this was not done for showing or commercial purposes. After World War II, the Komondor was almost extinct, but was brought back by passionate fanciers. It made its way to North America in the 1930s. Dating back to the 16th century, the Komondor is the largest of the native Hungarian breeds. This breed is a descendant of the Aftscharka (or Ovtcharka), a dog that was used by nomadic tribesman known as Cumans. Depending on how active your Komondor is, you\u2019ll have to feed your dog about 3 to 4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, which should be split into two meals. This will prevent bloat, especially if your Kom likes to gulp down his food. Since this is a large dog, you must ensure that your Komondor receives obedience training. Since this is a large dog, you must ensure that your Komondor receives obedience training. Start as early as possible for the best results. This breed becomes obstinate when bored, so it\u2019s in your best interest to keep training sessions interesting and upbeat. Use positive reinforcements for a job well done. Because the Komondor can be wary of strangers, socialization skills must be introduced when your dog is a puppy. Take your dog to new places and introduce him to new people as often as you can. As a natural guard dog, the Kom will be aggressive if he is not socialized properly as a puppy. The Komondor is a large to extra-large dog, tipping the scales from 80 to 100 pounds. As a livestock guarding dog, the Komondor is calm and steady, but when they feel threatened, they will defend their herd. These days, Komondors are also a wonderful family dog, as they are affectionate and protective of their family and people they know, and will be gentle with children. As we have mentioned before, the Kom is wary of strangers, but after being introduced, the Komondor will warm up to these new people. Once they are socialized properly, Komondors are loving companions. Komondors are generally healthy, but they may be subject to certain health conditions. These include bloat (gastric dilatation), cataracts, entropion and hip dysplasia. Expect your Komondor to live about 10-12 years, a normal amount of time for a dog of its size. Komondors do well with moderate exercise needs. These can consist of two or three short walks daily or adequate playtime in the yard. If you have a yard, it needs to be securely fenced so they can define their territory. As well, it will keep other animals from entering that territory. As a livestock guarding dog, the Komondor is calm and steady, but when they feel threatened, they will defend their herd. The American Kennel Club has this to say about the breed: \u201cA large, muscular breed, the Komondor is mostly known for its unusually dense, protective coat of heavy white cords (which make him look like a giant mop!) that form naturally as the breed matures in age. The coat serves to cover vulnerable body parts in case of attack, helps him blend in with his flock and protects him from weather extremes. While he has been a working dog in Hungary for ten centuries, he is also found in the show and obedience rings in the United States.\u201d The Komondor was recognized by the AKC in 1937. The Komondor coat is what helps set him apart from other dogs and helps him blend in with the sheep he is guarding. The Kom starts out with soft curls that grow into long, feltlike cords to give him that mop-like appearance. His undercoat is soft and woolly, while the topcoat is coarse. His coat color starts out as cream or buff, but it turns to while as he grows up. You won\u2019t need to brush the Komondor\u2019s coat, but it will take work to keep it looking its best. Once his coat begins to cord, you\u2019ll need to keep them clean and dry so they don\u2019t get dirty. You\u2019ll have to separate the cords on a regular basis to stop matting and get rid of dirt. Expect baths to take hours, as you\u2019ll have to ensure your Komondor\u2019s coat is completely dry. You can opt to keep your Kom\u2019s coat short and cord-free, but then you\u2019ll miss out on his distinctive appearance. It takes about three years for Komondor puppies to reach maturity. But once they reach it, you can expect it to have a calm, devoted personality. Puppies will need to be properly socialized, as this breed leans toward being reserved with people and other animals.

The Koolie is also known as the German Koolie because the predecessors of the breed were brought to Australia by early German settlers. The German Koolie was used as an all-purpose working breed until the 1800s when one of them accidentally mated with a Dingo, the wild dog of Australia. The result of this mating was a short-coated working breed ideally suited to the hot climate in the Australian outback. The breed rapidly gained popularity after that point and was used to develop other Australian working breeds like the Australian Kelpie and the Australian Cattle Dog.

The Kuvasz is truly a family dog as he will dedicate himself to loving and protecting his family for life. He is as headstrong as he is loyal and a better best friend would be hard to find. Although he is not an aggressive dog, his sheer size will frighten any intruder however; when it comes to protecting his family, the Kuvasz will die before he allows his family to be harmed. The Kuvasz is not for everyone. Kuvaszok (the plural for Kuvasz) need experienced owners who are willing to go to obedience classes and spend a significant amount of time with the dog. They are incredibly gorgeous dogs but they are also incredibly strong and strong-willed. This is not a breed for newcomers in the dog world. Read on for more information on Kuvaszok. The Kuvasz is truly a family dog as he will dedicate himself to loving and protecting his family for life. The Kuvasz is believed to have originated in Tibet and traveled with the Magyar when they invaded Hungary some 1,200 years ago. The name Kuvasz was derived from a Turkish word, Kawasz. Kawasz is translated to mean \u201carmed guard of the nobility\u201d. With his size, strength and protective nature, it is no wonder that he is considered a bodyguard for many people and their families. Once the Kuvasz reached Hungary, the breed was perfected into the gorgeous dog that we know today. In the 15th century, King Mathias of Hungary trusted his Kuvaszok more than he did anyone else. He had monstrous kennels to house hundreds of Kuvaszok on his palace grounds. They not only attended the livestock but also went out to hunt large game as well. These dogs were his prized possessions and it was an absolute honor when he bestowed a gift of a Kuvasz puppy to one of the many visiting royals. In fact, King Mathias gifted Vlad Dracula, who was the Prince of Wallachia, with one. After World War ll, there were actually less than thirty Kuvaszok dogs left alive in Hungary. The gene pool was so shallow that many of the remaining dogs were bred to Great Pyrenees. This resulted in the remarkable breed that we know as the Kuvasz. Because the Kuvasz is a large breed of dog, he will require a fair amount of high-quality dog food. Since quantities vary from brand to brand, it is impossible to accurately estimate how much food your dog should consume. Kuvoszok breeders strongly advise that all dogs be fed dry kibble from the time they are young puppies. This can help to prevent gum disease and tooth decay. It also helps to cut down on bad breath by leaving less plaque on the dog\u2019s teeth. Kuvaszok are very strong-willed and tend to have minds of their own. Kuvaszok are very strong-willed and tend to have minds of their own. This is why they make such great dogs for protecting your home, livestock and family. Training must be started as soon as they have received their first series of vaccinations, if you are going to formal classes. Otherwise, you can start training as soon as the puppy has become comfortable in your home. Training should be consistent and of a positive nature. Yelling, screaming or physical punishment should never be used as it will have a detrimental effect on the dog and can truly come back to bite you in the butt. Positive reinforcement with consistent lessons is the keys to having a well-trained and reliable Kuvasz. Generally, a male Kuvasz will weigh between 100 and 115 pounds. Females, as with most breeds, are smaller. The female Kuvasz usually weighs between 70 and 90 pounds. The Kuvasz has an incredible spirit as well as strong determination. His undeniable intelligence, child-like curiosity, blind courage and innate sensitivity make the Kuvasz a great addition to confident and experienced families. His watchful and protective nature makes him cautious when strangers are around his family. To him, his job and main reason for living is protecting those he loves. Adult dogs are rather patient with kids, but puppies are puppies\u2026 they will knock down little ones and perhaps use them as chew toys. Although the Kuvasz is a spectacular breed, it is not the best option for first-time dog owners or those who do not have a fair amount of exposure to large dogs. The Kuvasz is a relatively healthy breed of dog. Because they are so large, the breed is predisposed to hip dysplasia. Owners should understand that hip dysplasia can also be caused by slippery floors, falling, jumping too much exercise and excessive weight gain. Other health issues include Von Willebrand\u2019s Disease, Osteochondritis Dissecans and the dreaded Gastric Dilation Vulvulus, more commonly known as bloat. Although these issues are possible issues in Kuvaszok, they are not overwhelming. Ask your breeder for clearances and information about these issues. The average lifespan for a Kuvasz is 10 to 12 years. This is quite long for such a large breed dog. The Kuvasz is a large and energetic dog. Think about it; they were bred to protect livestock and royalty. Kuvaszok are happiest when they feel that they are doing a job that will be beneficial to their loved ones. You can get a backpack for your dog and go hiking together; this will make him feel needed. When you must go to work, it would be wise to leave toys out that require the dog to figure out how to get the treat hidden within. As an active dog, the Kuvasz is best suited for an active family. He will have no issue relaxing on the couch after a hard day of work. The American Kennel Club states that the Kuvasz is an: \u201cUnexcelled guard, possessing ability to act on his own initiative at just the right moment without instruction. Bold, courageous and fearless. Untiring ability to work and cover rough terrain for long periods of time\u201d.  The Kuvasz was first recognized by the AKC in 1931. The Kuvasz has an incredible spirit as well as strong determination. The Kuvasz is a dog that is all white. There are no other color options or derivatives acceptable to the breed\u2019s guidelines. The coat can be straight, wavy or even a combination of the two. Because of its thickness, a Kuvasz should be brushed several times each week to eliminate debris and dirt from the coat as well as detangle it. Bathing should be minimal and limited to once monthly, if needed. A Kuvasz puppy is a big white ball of energy. He will want to play until he passes out. This can be harmful to his development so keep exercise to a minimum until he is older. It is of the utmost importance that you socialize you Kuvasz puppy as soon as he has finished his series of puppy shots. This will help him to learn that he needn\u2019t be worried about every person coming to your home. Again, training should start at around 3 to 4 months of age. This will help to ensure that your baby puppy will grow to be a well-mannered yet loyal member of your family.

This dog looks remarkably like a wolf, having the same double coat and wild appearance. The dog is still a largely unknown breed but if you are lucky enough to meet one you will never forget the experience. Though the name of this breed might suggest that it is a cross between the Labrador Retriever and the Siberian Husky, the Labrador Husky is actually a completely separate breed. The exact origins of the Labrador Husky are unknown but it is common knowledge that this breed was developed in a region of northern Canada known as Labrador \u2013 this is where the breed got its name. The breed was likely developed from other Northern breeds after arriving to Labrador sometime during the 1300s. The breed was used for sledding by the Inuit people and it is possible that the Labradorian people have introduced some Alaskan Malamute blood to enhance the breed\u2019s sledding skills as well as some German Shepherd blood for trainability. Although the name would suggest that the Labrador Husky is a cross between the Labrador Retriever and the Siberian Husky, this is not the case. The Labrador Husky is closely related to other Northern Spitz-type breeds like the Siberian Husky and the Alaskan Malamute. Because the Labrador Husky is a large breed you should offer your dog a commercial dog food diet specially formulated for large-breed dogs. It is also recommended that you consider an active or working breed formula, especially if you train your dog for sledding or other dog sports. The Labrador Husky is an intelligent breed so it should respond well to training. The Labrador Husky is an intelligent breed so it should respond well to training. These dogs are likely to learn quickly as long as you maintain a firm and consistent hand in training. Positive reinforcement training methods are recommended for this breed and you should keep your training sessions short and fun to ensure that your dog doesn\u2019t lose interest and stop paying attention. Because this breed is so smart it needs plenty of mental and physical stimulation to prevent it from becoming bored and developing destructive behaviors. At maturity, the Labrador Husky typically stands between 20 and 28 inches tall and weighs between 60 and 100 pounds. Females of the breed are often a little bit smaller than the males. The Labrador Husky is not recommended for people who do not have a great deal of time to devote to the care of their dog. Not only does this breed require a great deal of mental stimulation but it also needs plenty of exercise and attention. The Labrador Husky is by no means a low-maintenance breed \u2013 leaving it alone for long periods of time or failing to meet its exercise requirements will likely result in the development of problem behaviors. The Labrador Husky is a friendly and loving breed by nature, though it does still require the same amount of socialization as any other breed. These dogs get along well with children when they are raised together and they bond closely with family. Labrador Huskies are strong and loyal companions that do especially well when given a job or task to do. Because little is known about the Labrador Husky there is little information available about specific conditions affecting the breed. The Labrador Husky is still a very rare breed and special care is taken with breeding, so it is unlikely that the breed will be affected by many major health problems. Any health problems the Labrador Husky does experience will likely be related to the size of the dog \u2013 large-breed dogs often develop musculoskeletal issues like hip dysplasia and they may have a greater risk for gastric dilation volvulus (or bloat). The Labrador Husky is a fairly healthy breed, though little is known about their exact life expectancy \u2013 it is estimated to be somewhere between 10 and 13 years. Because the Labrador Husky was developed as a working breed it has fairly high needs for exercise in order to work off its energy. This breed requires a long daily walk or jog in addition to some active play time. The breed will also appreciate having outdoor space to run and play. The Labrador Husky is a friendly and loving breed by nature, though it does still require the same amount of socialization as any other breed. Because the Labrador Husky is still a very rare and largely unknown breed it is not currently accepted for AKC registration. It is currently recognized by the Dog Registry of America, Inc. (DRA). Like many Spitz-type breeds, the Labrador Husky has a thick double coat consisting of a soft, dense undercoat and a longer overcoat. This breed sheds continuously throughout the year, though it also blows its coat twice per year. Regular brushing and grooming is required to keep shedding under control for this breed and to maintain healthy skin and coat. Occasional baths may be needed to fully clean the coat, though the Labrador Husky is generally a clean breed. As a large breed, the Labrador Husky may develop more slowly than smaller breeds. This being the case you may need to keep your dog on a large-breed puppy formula for over a year to ensure that he gets the energy he needs but to prevent him from growing too quickly and putting unnecessary strain on his bones and joints.

Other breeds are so legendary that the name is a selling point in and of itself. Enter the Labrador Retriever. The reputation of this beloved breed speaks for itself. There\u2019s a reason why suburbs are filled with these fine animals and why seemingly every family wants to bring one into their homes. These dogs live up to the hype. Labrador Retrievers are among the most popular dog breeds out there today for a reason. Loyal, easy to get along with, and easy to train, these retrievers could be considered a neighborhood classic all around the United States and even in other parts of the world. It\u2019s hard to find anything negative to say about these remarkable pooches and they are guaranteed to remain family favorites for generations to come. But what exactly makes Labrador Retrievers such popular and well-respected dogs? Does a strong breed always mean that a Labrador Retriever will be the right dog for you? The answers to these questions and many more can be found below. So if you\u2019ve ever considered bringing home a Lab Retriever, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll either be racing out to get a Lab or beginning your search for a new breed. But what exactly makes them such popular, well-respected dogs\u2026 and does a strong breed always mean that a Labrador Retriever will be the right dog for you? \n Canadian in decent, Labrador Retrievers originated in Newfoundland, having descended from the St. John\u2019s Water Dog around the 16th century. The smaller versions of the St. John\u2019s Water Dog were often used to retrieve as well as pull in fishing nets, giving this breed of dog a true working class background. Many people will observe that the personality of Labrador Retrievers is a strong indication of this background. These dogs are happiest when performing a task with their humans, after all. Descending from Portuguese, English, and Irish breeds, the Labrador Retriever could be considered a classic \u201cblue-collar\u201d dog. It is not quite on par with some hunting dogs, but certainly one of the more favorable \u201cworking\u201d dog breeds available out there today. More recent history through previous centuries brought the Labrador Retriever back to England where it became a popular sporting and hunting dog. These dogs may have started in Canada, but they belong to the world now. As the Labrador Retriever descends from St. John\u2019s Water Dogs, it certainly has a long way to trace its history and pedigree through the years, and is a direct descendant of popular European dogs throughout the High Middle Ages and onward. Although the Labrador Retriever was bred in the New World, it certainly has strong ties to other European breeds, though in the United States and the United Kingdom it has become perhaps the go-to breed in the world of registered pets. Golden Retrievers are a separate breed from the Labrador but you\u2019ll notice they share many common characteristics both physically and socially. The Labrador Retriever can come in a few colors, including Yellow and Chocolate. Labrador Retrievers tend to be more active, larger dogs and consequently need a fair amount of food in comparison with many dogs. Without plenty of activity, it is common for people to overfeed a Labrador Retriever and this leads to seeing plenty of overweight Retrievers. But what exactly makes an adequate Retriever diet? Although Labrador Retrievers are a larger breed of dog, it\u2019s important to remember that they still should only get to around 80 pounds on the higher end for males and 70 pounds for the females. Many people are tempted to feed their Retriever like they\u2019re another person in the home, but keep in mind that even an adult Retriever is typically just half the size of an average adult human. Like with many dogs, meats are popular as well as vegetables and many types of all-purpose dog food can be considered suitable for Labrador Retrievers. As always, if you are ever concerned about establishing or altering the diet of your Labrador Retriever, it\u2019s always wise to consult with a veterinarian first. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines that are worth consulting, they are still just guidelines and not exactly gospel. All dogs are different after all, each with their own needs. The only person qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is your vet. So always lean on their expertise before making any major changes to what fills up your Lab\u2019s food dish. Labrador Retrievers can put up with a lot of training and generally respond well to behavior training. Considered versatile, Labrador Retrievers can put up with a lot of training and generally respond well to behavior training. They are not excessively territorial or aggressive despite their large size and will often respond with all of the loyalty and obedience as you\u2019re capable of giving. For people who aren\u2019t interested in doing a lot of training on their dog, a Labrador Retriever makes an ideal dog because it will not always require a lot of work to keep it within the bounds of acceptable behavior. This isn\u2019t to say that all Labrador Retrievers will respond this way, however. It\u2019s still important to commit to a training regime.  Just like with any dog, this regime should be focused entirely on positive reinforcement and rewards-based training. Anything less is closer to abuse than training. Not only will that harm your dog, it will never deliver the training results that you desire. Negative training techniques should be avoided at all costs. As mentioned earlier, a typical healthy weight for an adult male Labrador Retriever is around 70-80 pounds and around 60-70 pounds for an adult female. If your Labrador Retriever tips the scales at 100 pounds, it would be considered officially obese and would benefit greatly from a weight loss regimen. Growing only to a few feet tall, Labrador Retrievers can be heavier dogs considering their relatively small frames, so be sure that your Labrador Retriever gets plenty of activity on a daily basis. Friendly, accepting and not territorial, Labrador Retrievers are ideal house pets. Despite their relatively large size, Labrador Retrievers are not a particularly hostile or aggressive breed and bond quite easily with children and adults alike. Because they are called \u201cRetrievers,\u201d Labradors make a perfect dog for tossing a Frisbee or a ball outside and respond well to play. Labradors are also excellent swimmers and love to get outdoors during the summer. These dogs are absolute sweethearts and the loving relationship that they form with their humans is a major reason why Labrador Retrievers have grown into such a popular and beloved breed. In addition to a few inherited disorders such as cataracts and hip and joint problems, Labrador Retrievers are susceptible to obesity if they do not receive a proper diet and a healthy amount of exercise. Your Labrador Retriever\u2019s health problems are likely to include joint issues, particularly if your dog is overweight and has been for a period of time. It\u2019s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a veterinarian to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as quickly as possible. A relatively normal life expectancy of around 10-12 years makes Labrador Retrievers a solid breed to grow up with your children. Labrador Retrievers can get heavy quickly and do require a lot of exercise. Luckily, the breed responds well to physical activity and is anxious to exercise throughout the day. Throwing a ball or Frisbee in the backyard can help keep your Labrador Retriever busy and panting even when you don\u2019t particularly feel like moving around too much yourself. However, for the sake of your Lab\u2019s health (and to ensure that they don\u2019t burn off any excess energy in a more mischievous manner), it\u2019s important to try and keep up with your Labrador Retriever and fulfill their exercise requirements every day. As a bonus, it\u2019ll also fulfill your daily exercise requirements as well! So, that\u2019s a plus, right? Friendly, accepting and not territorial, Labrador Retrievers are ideal house pets. The American Kennel Club calls the Labrador Retriever \u201cgentle, intelligent and family-friendly.\u201d Labrador Retrievers typically have short coats with colors ranging everywhere from Yellow to Chocolate. You might even see fox-colored Retrievers. Labrador Retrievers will shed as they\u2019re double-coated, but its coats are quite water-resistant which makes them great swimmers. Generally, Labrador puppies should not be brought home before 7-10 weeks old, but many people enjoy Labrador puppies and find that once they adjust to life in the house they can make entertaining pets.

First used as a water-dog, the Lagotto has since been used as a specialized truffle-hunter. A profession that has helped keep the breed alive and given Lagottos a treasured place in Italian culture. Lagotto Romagnolos are mediums sized yet robust dogs. Their long legs are well-boned and muscular, as are their chests and shoulders. These characteristics make them excellent swimmers as well as diggers. The Lagotto\u2019s body is covered in a thick, waterproof coat made up of soft, curly hairs. They come in a variety of shades ranging from brown, white to grey. Lagottos are one of the rarest breeds in the world and there are only around 500 registered Lagottos in the U.S today. However, they are rapidly gaining popularity as an excellent companion dog. They are loving, devoted and playful and make excellent family pets.  The Lagotto Romagnolo (pronounced La-go-toh Roman-yolo) is a dog with a rich history behind it and is one of Italy\u2019s oldest known dog breeds. The story of the Lagotto Romagnolo begins in the 16th century Italian marshlands. First used as a water-dog, Lagottos are in fact believed to be part of the foundation stock that all other modern water dog breeds are descended from. Which means that the Lagotto is the great grandfather of breeds like the Golden Retriever, Portuguese Water Dog and the Poodle. Around the 19th century, Italy\u2019s Lagotto population faced a severe decline in numbers when the Italian marshlands were claimed for farming. However, their excellent sense of smell helped them garner interest from Italian truffle collectors. Lagottos have been used almost exclusively for this purpose ever since. The Lagotto Romagnolo is a very ancient of breed that has been unchanged through the centuries. It is believed that the breed originated from a distinctive breed of duck retriever that existed in the 7th century B.C in the marshlands of Romagna, Italy. Lagottos should be fed two daily meals of high quality dog food. Lagottos are an extremely intelligent breed and are always eager to please. Lagottos are an extremely intelligent breed and are always eager to please. This makes training them a pleasure. They\u2019re also an extremely strong and agile breed and excel in agility contests. Lagottos also have extremely strong retrieving and searching instincts and this should be taken into consideration when developing a training plan. Laggottos weigh around 24-35 pounds when fully grown. The Lagotto Romagnolo is a very loving dog that is devoted to its owner. They are also extremely affectionate and gentle with children and make excellent family pets. Lagottos have excellent eyesight and are extremely alert. They will quickly alert their owners to any intrusions into the family property and often make excellent guard dogs. Lagottos get along fairly well with other dogs and pets, provided that they are socialized from an early age. They do have fairly strong hunting instincts, especially when it comes to birds and fowl, so owners might want to walk their Lagottos on a leash. Lagottos are an extremely intelligent breed and were bred as a working dog. Therefore they require a great deal of mental stimulation to lead a happy and balanced life. They also love to dig and owners should ideally provide their Lagottos with a sandbox or designated digging area where they can indulge in this tendency. Lagottos are a generally healthy breed and do not suffer from any major hereditary health issues. Some breeding lines are known to have problems with hip dysplasia and epilepsy. Lagottos have fairly long life spans and can often live up to 16 years. Lagottos are born to work hard and require rigorous, daily exercise. They make excellent hiking and jogging partners. Lagottos also love to swim and often take to the water naturally given the opportunity. It is also important to remember that as a working breed, Lagottos require a \u201cmeaningful\u201d and mentally stimulating task that they can engage in each day to live happy and fulfilled lives. This can be something as simple as a game of fetch or a session of hide and seek. The Lagotto Romagnolo is a very loving dog that is devoted to its owner. The Lagotto Romagnolo is currently being recorded in the AKC\u2019s Foundation Stock Service. The club has this to say about the breed: \u201cA small to medium-sized breed, the Lagotto Ramagnolo is the only purebred dog in the world recognized as a specialized searcher of truffles, which are forms of edible fungi found in its homeland of Italy. Lagotti also possess striking coats, made up of thick, waterproof curls that cover their entire body. Coat colors include brown, brown road, off-white, orange, white and brown, or white and orange. The breed has been a part of AKC\u2019s Foundation Stock Service since 2001 under the Sporting group designation.\u201d The Lagotto\u2019s coat consists of a thick layer of curly hair. This hair does not shed and Lagottos need to be trimmed occasionally to prevent their coat from matting. They also make great pets for dog owners with mild allergies.

Bold and friendly, the Lakeland Terrier fits well into a variety of living situations, whether you\u2019re in the country or in the city. Perfect for those with an active lifestyle, the Lakie will keep you on your toes while proving himself as a loving companion. Read on to learn more about this wonderful breed. Lakeland Terriers, also known as \u201cLakies,\u201d are lively, feisty little dogs that are affectionate, friendly, and confident. Bred and raised in Northern England in the 1800s, the Lakeland Terrier gets his name from the rugged and mountainous Lake District. This practical working dog\u2019s job was to hunt and kill foxes, badgers, otters and other vermin that plagued farm, especially during the lambing season. With his small, narrow body, he was able to squeeze into rocky dens. This dog was so tenacious, he would often go deep underground and stay there for days \u2013 that\u2019s how determined he was to kill his prey! Because this breed was valued by hunters and farmers, they were often given as gifts to friends and other hunters. Now he is family dog, a reliable guard and watch dog and show dog. Because the Lakeland Terrier is an older breed, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint its exact ancestors. However, it is believed that it is a relative to the Border Terrier, as well as the Bedlington Terrier. The Lakie is most likely the result of crossing several different terriers, which could include the Bedlington Terrier, the Welsh Terrier, the Dandie Dinmont and the Wire-Haired Fox Terrier. Like most breeds, the Lakeland Terrier does well on a diet of high-quality kibble, about one cup a day that\u2019s divided into two meals. Lakeland Terriers can be possessive of their food, but obedience training will help curb this habit. Thanks to his independent streak, the Lakeland Terrier can be a challenge to train. Thanks to his independent streak, the Lakeland Terrier can be a challenge to train. You\u2019ll need to be patient, as well as firm and consistent, to ensure training goes well. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play to get the most out of your lessons. As well, lessons should be short and entertaining so that your Lakie doesn\u2019t lose interest. Always be consistent with training and discipline (but never harsh) in order to establish your role as the leader of the household. After basic training has been mastered, your Lakeland Terrier will flourish with advanced training and agility activities. This will help keep his mind and body alert and active. You may find that housetraining can be trying. Again, this is when patience and consistency are needed. Stick to a bathroom schedule and make sure a job well done is rewarded with praise and treats. You\u2019ll want to crate train your Lakie to help curb indoor accidents. The Lakeland Terrier\u2019s weight ranges from 15 to 17 pounds, making it a small dog. This is a typical terrier, so expect your dog to be fearless and bold, as well as independent. Curious about everything around him, you\u2019ll find the Lakeland Terrier to be intelligent and entertaining. This breed loves the outdoors and lives for an endless game of catch. And this love of fun lasts well into adulthood. The Lakie does well in families with older children, and can sometimes be wary of strangers if not socialized properly. Often possessive of toys and food, children should be taught proper etiquette around this breed. If boundaries are crossed, a snapping accident can occur. When taking your Lakeland Terrier for a walk, always keep him on a leash. Never leave your Lakie unattended in a fenced-in area \u2013 this breed is known to dig and tunnel their way out in search of greener grass and squirrels to catch. The Lakeland Terrier is relatively free of health issues. The only health concerns that could arise are eye problems and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. The Lakeland Terrier has an average lifespan of 12 to 16 years. A great dog for an active family, the Lakeland Terriers has energy to spare.

Small, sturdy and workmanlike, the breed\u2019s narrow frame allows him to squeeze into rocky dens to chase after vermin. While generally a show dog or family companion today, Lakelands can also be found utilizing their natural instincts at Earthdog events or digging in the backyard.\u201d The AKC first recognized this breed in 1934. Lakeland Terriers sport a double coat that features of a soft undercoat, and a thick, hard topcoat. To keep it looking its best, you must strip it several times a year. Hair on the head, ears, chest, shoulders and behind tail is short and smooth, while the hair on the body is an inch long and wavy.  You should keep the facial hair trimmed, but keep the hair over the eyes longer to create the rectangular look of the head. Lakies\u2019 coats come in an array of colors. These include blue, black, liver (a deep reddish-brown), red, and wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). Color combinations on the saddle can include blue and tan, black and tan, or liver and tan, as well as what is called red grizzle or grizzle and tan. Grizzle is a mixture of black or red hairs with white hairs. If you keep your Lakeland Terrier stripped, you\u2019ll find that your dog won\u2019t shed as much. As well, you should spend 15 to 30 minutes a week brushing your Lakie. The Lakeland Terrier can be wary of strangers and other animals. This is why it\u2019s a good idea to socialize your puppy at every opportunity.

He is a great family companion for active and energetic people. The Leonberger is a giant breed of dog that is a bundle of energy and craves being close to his family. In the 1800s, the Leonberger breed was established in Leonberg, Germany. His original purpose was to be a loving family companion, alarm system for the farm and draft dog. Today, he is a gentle and useful member of the family, using his size and appearance to deter unwelcomed humans from entering his home. The Leonberger is the result of various cross breedings of Newfoundlands, Saint Bernards and Great Pyrenees. The breed was on the brink of extinction after World War II. Fortunately, two fellows used the remaining Leos to revitalize the breed and make it into the wonderful dog that we know today. Leos are huge dogs and they require a tremendous amount of high-quality, dry dog food. Their nutritional needs must be met for optimum health so a food specifically formulated for giant breeds is indicated. To prevent gum disease, tooth decay and bad breath, strictly dry kibble should be fed. Highly intelligent, the Leonberger is a relatively easy dog to train. Highly intelligent, the Leonberger is a relatively easy dog to train. It is essential that the trainer be assertive but gentle. Using delectable treats will make the training sessions more successful and enjoyable. Positive reinforcement is the only method that should be used while training the Leo. Being forceful will lead to the dog balking and becoming unresponsive during the session. Leonbergers do well in obedience trials and rather enjoy them. With regular and consistent training, this breed can attain Utility Dog titles. Leos also do very well as therapy dogs and people in hospitals and nursing homes enjoy visits with them. The Leo usually weighs between 120 and 170 pounds and stands between 25 and 31 inches tall at the shoulder. Although they are giant in size, Leonbergers are gentle by nature. Their hearts are just as big as their bodies and they will try to befriend everyone they meet. The Leo will gladly accept strangers so long as they are not threatening to his family or home. He is very trustworthy with children however; his great size can cause smaller kids to be knocked over and fall down. This is something he cannot help because he would never intentionally cause them any harm. Leos love water and mud. They will happily romp through dirt and mud as well as roll in it. Their wet coats are magnets for leaves, twigs, burdock, grass and other debris. Though they don\u2019t mind it, it could surely be a problem for a family of neat freaks. The Leonberger is calm and laid back in the house however; he does not like when people argue. Any disagreements should be settled behind closed doors and away from a Leo otherwise, he very well might get between the bickerers to end the dispute. A sturdy and generally healthy dog, the Leonberger is not free from possible genetic issues. Cancer, polyneuropathy, eye, heart and thyroid problems have been reported in this breed. Elbow and hip dysplasia are becoming more prevalent since the breed was recognized by the AKC. The average Leonberger lives to be between 8 and 10 years of age. Leonbergers are energetic and active dogs. They love to run and play with their families or other pets. A large, fenced and secure fenced yard is necessary for the Leo to stretch out while running. Families who don\u2019t have that much space enjoy bringing the Leonberger on long walks and to their local dog parks for some heavy duty playtime. Although they are giant in size, Leonbergers are gentle by nature. The American Kennel Club states: \u201cCalm, gentle and sweet, the Leonberger excels as a multi-purpose working dog, but its most important task is being a reliable family companion.

This breed always has a black mask but the main coat colors can be yellowish brown, red, reddish brown or a sandy color. A telltale lion-like mane is essential in the Leo. The Leonberger has loads of fur and it requires a thorough brushing at least once each week. Bathing should be done when necessary, which with this breed, tends to be quite often. Homes in which Leos live will always have some dog hair on the floor so neat freaks should avoid this breed. Leonberger puppies are incredibly cute and cuddly however; they need lots of socialization. Puppy kindergarten classes should be started as soon as possible. It is important to note that during the Leo\u2019s adolescent years, he can become obnoxious and refuse to do anything he is told to do.

Admirable, gentle, playful, energetic, bold, and feisty, the Maltese loves to run, play and even stand up to bigger dogs. The Maltese is known as the oldest of all dog breeds and the oldest of European toy breeds. In fact, Charles Darwin placed this breed as far back as 6000 B.C. Although no one can be 100 percent sure where it came from originally, most believe the Maltese come from the island of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea, hence its name. When the Crusaders and nomadic tribes brought them to England, women liked to carry them in their sleeves. Royalty took a shine to the Maltese \u2013 Mary Queen of Scots, Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria, Josephine Bonaparte and Marie Antoinette all owned a Maltese. It was shown in American in 1877 as Lion Dogs. Since it is known as the oldest dog breed, it\u2019s impossible to trace what dog the Maltese was bred from. Some think this breed originated from Asia and may have helped to breed the Lhasa Apso, Tibetan Terrier, Tibetan Spaniel and the Pekingese. The breed also played into ancient Egyptian culture around the times of 300 to 600 B.C., and was featured on Greek vases around 500 B.C. It is also said that this breed could be a descendant of a Spitz-like dog that is used to hunt in marshes and wooded areas in Southern Europe (Maltese have been used for controlling rodents).

Keep them with you in the house on a leash, and if you can\u2019t watch them, your dog should be in its crate at these times. It will also help if you take them outside to do its business before and after playing and eating, when they wake in the morning, and before they go to sleep for the night. Be sure to use treats and lots of praise when your Maltese goes outside. The Maltese needs plenty of socialization and exposure to different people, places and animals starting from a young age.

The Maltese doesn\u2019t shed, but the breed is prone to tear stains around the eyes. Some people adorn their dog with a bow on its head. Because of its long hair, keeping your dog\u2019s coat free of snarls and clean of dirt is important. These dogs require daily grooming. If you don\u2019t want the maintenance involved with a long coat, you can opt for a \u201cpuppy cut\u201d \u2013 the hair is left 1 to 2 inches long all over the Maltese\u2019s body, which makes it look like a puppy.

They do well in rural, suburban or urban homes. The Manchester Terrier has been around for centuries however; the dog that we know today was actually developed by John Hulme. His desire was to develop a dog that could hunt down rats and kill them very quickly. To do so, he crossed the Black and Tan Terrier with the Whippet. The continuous breeding of the dogs from those crosses have given us the Manchester Terrier that we recognize today. It is essential that Manchester Terriers be fed a high-quality diet of dry kibble. Dry food will help prevent the buildup of plaque, tooth loss, gum disease and bad breath. Tooth loss is a problem with the breed that can be easily prevented.

The coat of the Manchester Terrier should be short and smooth. It is always black-based with rich, mahogany markings on his face, ears, muzzle, legs and undercarriage. The markings on the dog are quite similar to those found on the Doberman Pinscher. Grooming is minimal for a Manchester Terrier. A grooming glove or soft brush should be used weekly to keep him looking fresh and glossy. Bathing is only needed when the dog gets dirty or begins to smell bad. Manchester Terrier puppies are fragile and can get hurt simply by hugging them too tightly. Care should be taken when allowing children to hold or carry them.

These dogs are known for their thick white coats, fluffy tails, and their fearlessness. The name for this breed comes from the Maremma marshlands where the breed worked for thousands of years, though sheep-farming has decreased in this area in recent years. The Maremma Sheepdog is an Italian breed of livestock guarding dog. The Maremma Sheepdog is a livestock guarding breed native to the mountains of Tuscany. Breeds of this type have existed since ancient Roman times so the exact origins of the Maremma Sheepdog are unknown. The first time the Maremma Sheepdog was registered occurred in 1898 \u2013 the breed was known as the Maremmano in the Libro delle Origini Italiano at the time and it was registered with the Kennel Club Italiano. The first standard for the breed was published in 1924. The exact origins of the Maremma Sheepdog are unknown because sheep-protecting dogs have existed since ancient Roman times. The breed is thought to share some of its heritage with other mountain breeds including the Kuvasz, Pyrenean Mountain Dog, and the Polish Tatra Sheepdog. As a large-breed dog, the Maremma Sheepdog should be fed a high-quality commercial dog food diet formulated for dogs of its size. Because this breed is a high-energy working breed, however, an active or working breed formula may be more appropriate to meet his needs. Because the Maremma Sheepdog is an intelligent breed it generally responds well to training. Because the Maremma Sheepdog is an intelligent breed it generally responds well to training. These dogs can be independent at times, however, so you need to establish yourself as the alpha of the household and maintain a firm and consistent hand in training.

The Maremma Sheepdog is a large-breed dog that typically stands 23.5 to 28.5 inches tall and weighs 65 to 100 pounds at maturity. This fluffy white dog is known to be a friendly and even-tempered breed, though (like most livestock guarding breeds) it does have a bit of an independent streak. These dogs are loyal to their human companions and they are fearless when it comes to protecting those they love. This breed gets along well with other dogs and household pets, though it may be a bit aloof around strangers. Early socialization is recommended to control this breed\u2019s protective instincts and to ensure that he does not become too dominant or willful. Because this breed is smart it also needs plenty of mental stimulation to prevent the development of problem behaviors due to boredom. As an ancient breed, the Maremma Sheepdog is a healthy and hardy breed for the most part. Like all dogs, however, they are prone to certain health problems, many of them related to the breed\u2019s large size. Maremma Sheepdogs are prone to hip dysplasia as well as other musculoskeletal issues. Feeding your Maremma Sheepdog puppy a large-breed puppy formula will help keep him from growing too fast which will also reduce his risk for bone and joint problems later in life. The average lifespan for the Maremma Sheepdog breed is 11 to 13 years. Because the Maremma Sheepdog is a highly intelligent working breed, these dogs need a great deal of daily exercise.

Why? It\u2019s almost like looking up a breed in and of itself: the Mastiff is such a varied and multifaceted division in the world of dog breeds that you\u2019re likely to come across a number of different individual Mastiff breeds. There are Cuban Mastiffs, English Mastiffs, French, German, Japanese Mastiffs \u2013 heck, we probably don\u2019t have the space to list them all right here. (Note: We will, however, be doing a lot of concentration in the English Mastiff, the oldest of English dog breeds and often synonymous with the breed.) So how do you find out whether or not a Mastiff is really right for you? Well, you learn about the breed and about the common characteristics many of them share. In this summation of the world of Mastiffs, we\u2019ll do our best to bring all of this information together so that you can easily navigate through the breed and find out if one might suit your home situation. Let\u2019s take a closer look and find out what this breed is really all about. The original English Mastiff has a pedigree that can be traced throughout history and has been intertwined with the history of Europe itself. Many Mastiffs are particularly young breeds, particularly if you\u2019re talking about the American Mastiff, a breed that is so young that we can trace its roots back to English and Anatolian Mastiff breeding about 20 years ago. You may not be old enough to remember a time when there was no such thing as the American Mastiff. But when you\u2019re talking about the formal \u201cMastiff,\u201d you are talking about the English Mastiff, which is the breed many of the subsets can trace its roots. The English Mastiff actually has a long history, having been given a name by the ancient Romans, who spotted the dogs in what was then known as Britannia. This breed is recognized as the oldest English breed. The breed was being described in documents even around the 16th century, but even during the 15th century\u2019s infamous Battle of Agincourt, at least one Mastiff was present. There is evidence that the Mastiff also made the trip to America on the Mayflower, although the real documentation for Mastiffs in America didn\u2019t start until the 19th century. Today, the Mastiff is a classic enough breed that it has the aforementioned offshoots all over the world, from Cubans to Americans. Given the name Pugnaces Brittanae, the original English Mastiff has a pedigree that can be traced throughout history and has been intertwined with the history of Europe itself. These dogs have remained very pure throughout the ages, which is probably why the classic light-brown color along with the black mask has been such a familiar trait of dogs throughout the years. The large size of the dog breed has also been a favorite of many noblemen and leaders who have had their portraits taken with their dogs by their side, giving us verification that the Mastiffs referred to in historical times match what we know about their history today. Mastiffs are large dogs and require a similarly healthy-sized diet, but the real danger of overfeeding an under exercised dog means that you shouldn\u2019t necessarily feed them too much. It\u2019s a good idea to keep your Mastiff well-enough fed that its mood and general health do not suffer. These dogs enjoy a good cut of meat and a lot of meat-flavored food, so even flavoring other kibbles or even vegetables with meat can be a great treat for Mastiffs. Mastiffs are strong instinctual dogs that are aggressive in guardianship but responsive to training. Don\u2019t over-run your Mastiff for the first two years of its life. Like many large dogs, the Mastiff can run into hip and joint problems that should not be exacerbated by over exercise. At the same time, regular exercise will be critical in ensuring that your Mastiff has a relatively healthy weight throughout its life. Mastiffs are strong instinctual dogs that are aggressive in guardianship but responsive to training and can even be easy-going in temperament to people it recognizes. The English Mastiff can weigh 150-250 pounds in males and 120 to 200 pounds in females. Mastiffs are instinctual guardians, and will often put themselves in between its owners and other people as a matter of instinct. Despite this instinct, however, the Mastiff is popular because it can be such a friendly and loyal guardian of the house in other occasions, making it an easy \u201clarge\u201d dog to get along with. Its sheer size can be a little intimidating for some people, but if a dog\u2019s size doesn\u2019t bother you, you can find both a great companion and an instinctive guard dog for your home, making the Mastiff\u2019s temperament very versatile. Mastiffs are large and will see a lot of problems corresponding to this size, particularly with joint and hip problems like hip dysplasia. They also see a range of other health problems that you\u2019ll want to consult an animal doctor about. Living anywhere from 10-12 years in general, the care you take of your Mastiff will have a dramatic impact on its lifespan. A regular routine of exercise and good eating habits should extend its life considerably. Regular exercise is required for Mastiffs as just about any dog, but it\u2019s important not to go too hard on these large dogs because of potential hip and joint problems. Mastiffs are instinctual guardians, and will often put themselves in between its owners and other people as a matter of instinct. The American Kennel Club writes of the Mastiff, \u201cOne of the biggest dogs recognized by the American Kennel Club, the massive Mastiff loves being around people and is known to bond closely with his \u2018family.\u2019\u201d A short coat, generally predictable in color, the Mastiff is certainly a low grooming-type dog. Requiring light exercise, be sure not to over-run your Mastiff as a puppy. Give it activity but remember puppies are growing a considerable amount, so it\u2019s best to avoid overworking them.

If you are looking for an active and loyal companion or a smart dog that can be trained for various dog sports, the Miniature American Shepherd is the right choice for you. The history of the Miniature American Shepherd began in 1968 when Doris Cordova of Norco, California set out to breed a smaller version of the Australian Shepherd. By the mid-1970s, the breed reached its desired size and bred true. In 1990, the Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of the USA (MASCUSA) was formed \u2013 that was the same year the AKC recognized the Australian Shepherd as a breed. By 1993, the Miniature Australian Shepherd was no longer allowed to participate in the AKC because it was too similar to the Australian Shepherd. In that same year (1993), the MASCUSA was asked by the AKC to change its name \u2013 thus, it became the North American Miniature Australian Shepherd Club. With this split came a split between the Miniature Australian Shepherd and the Miniature American Shepherd. In 2011, the MASCUSA became the parent club of the new Miniature American Shepherd breed and, in 2012, the Miniature American Shepherd was admitted into the AKC Foundation Stock Service.

Believe it or not, this breed was actually developed in 1968. Back then, Doris Cordova of Norco, California began a breeding program with the dream of developing a smaller version of the Australian Shepherd. By using small Australian Shepherds, Cordova and a handful of other breeders were successful in creating a miniature version of the Australian Shepherd. Yet, throughout the short history of the breed, there has been a great deal of controversy. The National Stock Dog Registry (NSDR) considered the Miniature Australian Shepherd a size variant of the Australian Shepherd, while the Australian Shepherd Club of America considered it an entirely separate breed. For many years, it was impossible to get these two organizations on the same page. Both the AKC and the UKC grouped the Miniature Australian Shepherd and the Australian Shepherd together. Things finally changed in 2011. That\u2019s when the AKC at long last admitted the Miniature Australian Shepherd to the Foundation Stock Service (under the name Miniature American Shepherd). Then in 2015, they granted full recognition to the breed. It took a while, but it happened. The Miniature Australian Shepherd was bred from small specimens of the Australian Shepherd breed starting in 1968. The current Miniature Australian Shepherd is a mirror image of the Australian Shepherd, just in a smaller size. Simple as that. As always, to make sure that your new pet stays happy and healthy in your care, you should provide the pup with a well-balanced diet. Predictably, the Miniature Australian Shepherd does well on a high-quality dry dog food diet. Kibble meets their nutritional needs and obviously it\u2019s a rather convenient option (both in terms of serving and availability). However, not just any kibble will do. You will need to pick out a premium brand that offers the right blend for the unique requirements of a dog like the Miniature Australian Shepherd. This means dry food suitable for their age (puppy, adult, senior), size (small, obviously), and activity level (a small breed that\u2019s also quite active).  To tick off all the boxes from this list, the kibble must have a high percentage of meat-based protein, followed by healthy fats and other important nutrients that will give them \u201cfuel\u201d but ensure that they stay lean. If you have trouble finding a brand of kibble that meets your Miniature Australian Shepard\u2019s needs, then it\u2019s always wise to consult with your vet. After all, every dog is different. Even if they seem to match the requirements on a package of kibble, there might be some unseen variable that changes things. Your vet will have a better sense of what your specific dog requires than any kibble manufacturer.  As a dog with a small stature but \u201cbig dog needs\u201d, the Miniature Australian Shepherd will often have a voracious appetite. However, they are also prone to obesity so make sure that the nutritionally-dense food you\u2019re giving them is well spent through exercise. Otherwise, your compact companion could quickly become overweight and suffer from health issues that come with it. Smaller dogs need to stay in shape because any weight related health issues can hit them quickly. So it\u2019s always wise to keep your little pup active to ensure that they stay healthy and happy. As an added bonus, it should help keep you happy and healthy as well.  The Miniature Australian Shepherd is an incredibly intelligent breed and is eager to learn. The Miniature Australian Shepherd is an incredibly intelligent breed and one that is always eager to learn. These dogs can be trained for a variety of dog sports including agility, obedience, herding, fly ball, disc dog, and so much more. The key is to start training early and to maintain a firm, consistent hand throughout the process. The most effective strategy for training Miniature Australian Shepherd (or any dog, to be honest) is to use positive reinforcement tactics. Motivate your pet by rewarding their success with treats and excited praise. No pooch can be immune to that!  Also, this breed wants to please their owners, so it will only contribute to the efficiency of this training method. On the other hand, aversive training is not only inefficient but cruel for the dog, too. Being harsh, yelling and punishing your dog won\u2019t get you anywhere. Negative reinforcement and harsh training methods are thankfully a thing of the past. That\u2019s abuse, not training. No dog should ever have to suffer through that process.  As with any pup, it\u2019s always a good idea to start early with any training and socialization. Even when they\u2019re just puppies, these smart dogs learn quickly and see training as just another source of the fun times that they get to spend with their proud owners. Start with the basics such as walking on a leash and potty training before moving on to the more \u201ccomplex\u201d stuff, like teaching commands or training for dog sports. Baby steps, people. Eventually, you\u2019ll get to any trick or sport that you have in mind. Your Miniature Australian Shepherd will love it, just take your time and be patient if you want to see the best possible results.  Some owners will say that the Miniature Australian Shepherd is more difficult to housebreak and train than its larger counterpart, but maintaining authority over the dog will go a long way to simplifying the process. These dogs require plenty of mental and physical stimulation to prevent the development of unwanted behaviors. As a breed, they can be prone to separation anxiety as they grow very close to their families. To prevent this, teach your pet to feel safe when home alone, and crate train them on time. Otherwise, their natural sense loyalty and love for their humans will turn into something sad and destructive. The average weight of the Miniature Australian Shepherd is between 17 and 30 lbs. Their compact size makes them a perfect pet for anyone living in an apartment, provided that you still give them the activity and exercise that they need to live long and healthy lives. The Miniature Australian Shepherd is a friendly and active breed that loves to play. These dogs are loyal and affectionate and they get along well with active children and families. Miniature Australian Shepherds are attentive and somewhat protective but, overall, they aim to please. These dogs have a great deal of mental and physical energy so they require plenty of daily exercise and mental stimulation to prevent the development of any sort of problematic behavior. Owing to their compact size, people often forget that they have the same needs and drives as their larger shepherd cousins. Don\u2019t neglect their activity requirements if you want your pet to be happy and well-behaved. Provide plenty of exercise and engage their bright minds with puzzle toys and interactive playtime. Regular playtime goes a long way to ensure that these pups live long and happy lives as part of your family. These dogs are also social and love to spend time with family, so if they are left alone too often for long periods of time, they may develop separation anxiety. Miniature Australian Shepherds also tend to be apprehensive around strangers, but they are generally not aggressive with people. So socializing them early in their development is a wise idea. Because the Miniature Australian Shepherd is not genetically different from the Australian Shepherd (except for its size), it is prone to the same conditions. Some of the most common conditions affecting this breed include hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, cataracts, epilepsy, collie eye abnormality, and spinal defects. In many cases, health problems are related to the genes that are responsible for the common merle coloration in this breed \u2013 particularly hearing and vision-related conditions. The average life expectancy of the Miniature Australian Shepherd is between 12 and 15 years. The Miniature Australian Shepherd is an incredibly active and energetic dog. So, if they are not given adequate daily exercise and mental stimulation, this breed is likely to develop behavioral problems. This breed requires a long daily walk in addition to plenty of outdoor play time. Training this dog for various dog sports including herding, agility, and fly ball will help to work off some of its extra energy. Keep them active and you\u2019ll never experience any problems with these energetic doggos. The Miniature Australian Shepherd is a friendly and active breed that loves to play. The Miniature Australian Shepherd is part of the AKC\u2019s Herding Group. The breed was officially recognized by this renowned canine club in 2015 as \u201cMiniature American Shepherd\u201d. It took 4 years for these compact shepherds to move on from AKC Foundation Stock Service to an official breed status in the United States, but it finally happened. The American Kennel Club describes the Miniature Australian Shepherd as a \u201chighly versatile, energetic dog (that) makes an excellent athlete with superior intelligence and a willingness to please those to whom he is devoted\u201d. We\u2019re inclined to agree.  The Miniature Australian Shepherd has a medium-long double coat \u2013 a soft, dense undercoat and a longer weather resistant outer coat. The coat can be either straight or wavy. It also comes in a variety of colors including black, red, blue merle, and red merle. Any of these coat colors may also come with white markings or tan points. Though the coat is fairly long and thick it does not require more than occasional brushing to remove mats and loose hairs. So the upkeep on these pups won\u2019t be too difficult. They are naturally pretty. The litter size for Miniature Australian Shepherds can range between five and nine puppies. The price of Miniature Australian Shepherd puppies will depend on the pedigree, but on average, reputable breeders sell puppies from AKC Champion bloodlines for $1200 to $1500. So, these dogs don\u2019t come cheap. But then again, none of the best pups do. If you want an animal as special as this, you\u2019ll need to seek out a specialist breeder and that comes with a hefty price tag. Fortunately, these beautiful and loving dogs are more than worth it.  Once your new puppy gets home and meets the family, it\u2019s time to start teaching them the basics. It is important to start puppies with training and socialization at a young age to prevent the development of problem behaviors. Housebreaking Miniature Australian Shepherd puppies can be tricky so be firm and consistent during training, but as we said before positive reinforcement techniques work the best. You merely need to establish yourself as the alpha in the relationship and that takes a firm, yet gentle hand.", "facts": " AKC Foundation Stock Service Families with children, active singles and seniors, houses with yards Intelligent, active, friendly, social", "tags": "agility training, collie eye abnormality, disc dogging, flyball, herding, Miniature Australian Shepherd, "}, "miniature bull terrier": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/miniature-bull-terrier/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/miniature-bull-terrier.jpg", "name": "Miniature Bull Terrier", "type": "dog", "text": "Many people find it amazing that the Miniature Bull Terrier is an exact version of the traditional Bull Terrier, except it is downsized.

The Mini Bull Terrier is a descendant of the English Bulldog and the White English Terrier, which is now no longer in existence.

As a matter of fact, the jovial nature and the distinctive egg-shaped head of the Bull Terrier made it an apt choice for Target ads and Anhauser Busch\u2019s popular \u201cSpuds McKenzie\u201d ad campaign\u201d. The Miniature Bull Terrier was recognized by the AKC in the Terrier Group in 1991. Mini Bulls are shorthaired dogs. The coat has a harsh texture but it has a shiny and flat appearance. The body of the dog is so muscular that the skin is held taut over it. There are only two color varieties within the breed. They are white, where the dog can have some color on the head and colored, which can be any color, anywhere. Grooming for a Miniature Bull Terrier owner is minimal. Brushing the coat every week will keep the Mini Bull\u2019s coat looking clean and shiny. When the dog is shedding, daily brushing is best.

To many people, the Doberman is an especially intimidating type of dog and it takes some real knowledge about the breed to understand that it can be friendly and loyal with the right kind of ownership and training. But we\u2019re not talking about Dobermans: we\u2019re talking about the Miniature Pinscher. What separates Miniature Pinschers from other breeds? For one, as you might imagine, the size is quite different. The Miniature Pinscher might have a lot of coloring like a Doberman, but the size is totally different and, unsurprisingly, the personality correlates with this difference in size. The Miniature Pinscher is a feisty, friendly dog sometimes known as the \u201cKing of the Toy Dogs.\u201d Given its relation to Doberman Pinschers, Miniature Pinschers also hail from Germany but have achieved an international following and popularity across a variety of countries and breed tastes. Today, the Miniature Pinscher is perhaps one of the most loveable and personable dogs out there. Even if you\u2019re a little unsure about dogs in the first place, getting yourself a Miniature Pinscher can be a highly rewarding experience. The Miniature Pinscher is a feisty, friendly dog sometimes known as the King of the Toy Dogs. Like Doberman Pinschers, Miniatures come from Germany. Believe it or not, however, the Miniature Pinscher is not a miniature Doberman \u2013 in fact, it predates the Doberman Pinscher by some 50 years. Like so many other breeds, the Miniature Pinscher first gained recognition during the 20th century where it began to be officially classified by formal dog organizations. Although Miniature Pinschers are miniature, they\u2019re not quite the toy dogs you might expect them to be. Sure, they might resemble a toy dog, but their personality has been altered by a more blue collar background, making them more independent and giving them a generally feistier personality. Many people might attribute this personality difference to their relation to the Doberman Pinscher, but in reality the Miniature Pinscher has developed and carved a niche all its own. The word \u201cPinscher\u201d refers to a terrier breed in German. But if Doberman Pinschers aren\u2019t the ancestors to the Miniature Pinscher, then who is? Well, both breeds are actually descended from the German Pinscher, which explains the fact that all three of these Pinscher groups come from that section of Northern Europe. There has been some confusion about the classification of the Miniature Pinscher for a while, and only as recently as the 1970s have the rules been changed to reflect the fact that the Miniature Pinscher is not a Miniature Doberman Pinscher but rather a Pinscher breed all its own. A small breed with plenty of capacity for exercise given its farmhand roots, the Miniature Pinscher can eat plenty but this diet should only correspond to a regular exercise regimen. The normal dog foods are encouraged as well as whole, natural ingredients when possible. Remember that the Miniature Pinscher should maintain a low weight of around 10 pounds and that each pound to a Pinscher is approximately 10 percent of its weight. Gaining a pound as a human is not a big deal but for a Miniature Pinscher, it can be. The Miniature Pinscher should not really be treated like a toy dog. The Miniature Pinscher should not really be treated like a toy dog \u2013 it\u2019s not a great socializer and will have a high tolerance for work and exercise. Consequently, if you want to make sure that your dog is properly raised according to the breed\u2019s characteristics, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure that your Miniature Pinscher has plenty of outdoor exercise on a regular basis. Miniature Pinschers aren\u2019t ideal for large families and are generally regarded as a dog for one or two people. Miniature Pinschers should only weigh around 8-10 pounds. Hey, they\u2019re called \u201cminiature\u201d for a reason. As mentioned, the Miniature Pinscher is more of a working-class personality than many other toy breeds, which breeds independence and feistiness that you wouldn\u2019t recognize in other small dogs. Making sure that your Miniature Pinscher has plenty of exercise is important, as it can become a destructive breed if left to its own boredom. Remember also that Miniature Pinschers are not always great socializers and generally won\u2019t make a fantastic pet for a large family with other dogs present. Miniature Pinschers not brought up with children, in particular, can be bad to have around children. Miniature Pinschers are better suited for experienced dog owners or at least someone who has free time around the house for plenty of training and patience. Miniature Pinschers will have the typical health problems associated with smaller dogs, including some potential risk for leg injuries given how much they run around and change direction. Legg\u2019s Perthes Disease is an affliction that can harm these dogs and often will have results similar to the hip dysplasia in larger dogs. A long-lived dog, the Miniature Pinscher can live around 14-17 years. Regular exercise is a big priority in the world of the \u201cMin Pin,\u201d so make sure that it gets plenty of opportunities to roam. Having your own land or at least a larger-spaced neighborhood will give your Miniature Pinscher more opportunities to exercise without the prospect of having to bark at other dogs. Miniature Pinschers aren\u2019t ideal for large families and are generally regarded as a dog for one or two people. The American Kennel Club puts it accurately: \u201cThe Miniature Pinscher can really spice up a person\u2019s life. This dog is small, but he doesn\u2019t know it! He\u2019s quick and active, with a lively curiosity.\u201d A short coat means minimal grooming, except for occasional brushing and shampooing. The dog\u2019s coats are often darker and uniform in color. Rambunctious especially as puppies, raising a Miniature Pinscher with children is a key distinction in this breed. If a dog is not raised with children, you\u2019ll want to be very wary about bringing your children around one. Raising a Miniature Pinscher around children should be undertaken by an experienced dog owner.", "facts": " AKC Toy Singles, seniors, apartments, houses with/without yards High energy, bold, stubborn, independent", "tags": "Germany, lap dog, Legg\u2019s Perthes Disease, Min Pin, Miniature Pinscher, small breed, "}, "miniature schnauzer": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/miniature-schnauzer", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/miniature-schnauzer.jpg", "name": "Miniature Schnauzer", "type": "dog", "text": "If you\u2019ve ever heard of a Miniature Schnauzer without having actually seen one, the name of the breed alone can be a catalyst to a host of odd images. How miniature is it? Is it a toy breed? Can I keep one in my pocket? Of course, a little knowledge goes a long way, and the truth about the Miniature Schnauzer is that this breed, known in Germany as the Zwergschnauzer, is actually closer to a poodle than it is a little dog that you can hold in your pocket. So, what does this all mean for someone who\u2019s looking for a new pet dog to bring home to the apartment or to the family? A Miniature Schnauzer is a lively, friendly, courageous pooch you\u2019ll never be bored around. Full of energy and brimming with positivity, these dogs can be mischievous but it\u2019s all in good spirit. Despite their active nature, Miniature Schnauzers make excellent city dogs but will work well even if you\u2019ve got plenty of space for them. In other words, the Miniature Schnauzer doesn\u2019t have to be a type of dog that only lovers of toy dogs can enjoy, whatever his name might suggest. It\u2019s an all around great dog for families of all shapes and sizes! Of course, the popularity of this breed already speaks volumes about their good traits. Now one of the most popular breeds in the U.S., the Miniature Schnauzer definitely has found solid footing in North America where many families chose these perky dogs as their pampered pets. But as you might imagine, its history and pedigree have deeper roots than that- the breed got its start many, many years back. If you\u2019re curious how Miniature Schnauzer came to be and what to expect with this breed, keep on reading! Miniature Schnauzers make excellent city dogs but will work well even if you\u2019ve got plenty of space for them. You can\u2019t have a dog word like Schnauzer without giving some homage to Germany, a country that, like England, has meant a lot to the world of dog breeding. Originally bred out of a combination of poodles and Affenpinschers, the Schnauzer\u2019s roots do indeed trace to the toy breeds. While Schnauzers can have a lot of temperament and personality traits that expose this ancestry, you\u2019ll find them to be a very versatile breed, as far as smaller dogs are concerned. Originally, Miniature Schnauzers were bred to be a more medium-sized dog that could help with farming \u2013 rounding up rodents, for example. But the Germans couldn\u2019t resist breeding it down into a smaller form, where its more natural state as a miniature dog took root. This occurred during the 1800s, as many breeds were also being developed, and today we\u2019re left with a breed that is distinct as many of the classic types of dogs that have been around for centuries longer. Perhaps it makes sense that all those German farmers and dog breeders didn\u2019t like the Miniature Schnauzer as, well, something that wasn\u2019t miniature. The pedigree of the Miniature Schnauzer, after all, goes to its dog breed parents: poodles and Affenpinschers. You can\u2019t breed those two types of dog and expect to come out with a German Shepherd on the other end \u2013 even if you\u2019re doing your breeding in Germany. So it makes sense that the Miniature Schnauzer\u2019s coat, temperament, and size are all well in line with many smaller dogs. That means if you\u2019re considering getting yourself a Miniature Schnauzer, you\u2019ll have to be familiar with its individual characteristics. For every dog, a well balanced, nutritious, healthy diet is the foundation of good health. Without good food in their bowl, dogs won\u2019t have the energy to go about their daily activities and their immune system will be weakened if they don\u2019t get the nutrients they need. Needless to say, this can lead to a myriad of health issues down the road so it\u2019s important to get your pet\u2019s diet right and make sure all of the key groups of nutrients are included in their daily meals. For most pet owners, the easiest and most effective route to go for is feeding commercial pet food. In case of Miniature Schnauzer, the best choice will be high-quality dry food for active small breed dogs. Of course, each dog is unique and leads a different lifestyle, so make sure to adapt your choice accordingly- consider your pet\u2019s age group, weight, and activity levels before choosing their chow.  Additionally, to give your Miniature Schnauzer all the vitamins and minerals his body needs, be sure to try cooking them meals from time to time, mashing in chopped vegetables along with bits of meat to ensure it\u2019s getting all the crucial nutrients. Besides, it will work as a great occasional treat and a welcome change from the standard kibble! In addition to type of food, another important consideration is portion control. Like many smaller breeds, it\u2019s easy to coddle the Miniature Schnauzer with a lot of food and too little exercise, particularly if you live in the city. That\u2019s why it will be important that you regulate its diet: give them plenty of exercise and don\u2019t let them eat too much. The Miniature Schnauzer is a loyal, fun dog that looks more like a classic breed than many people realize. Miniature Schnauzers can be highly responsive to training but can also have a bit of an independent streak that will be a little troublesome for first-time dog owners. Luckily, the Miniature Schnauzer has a reputation for being obedient to commands even if you\u2019re not a particularly skilled dog trainer. As mentioned before, these types of dogs will make excellent pets thanks to its personality. But don\u2019t let that be a reason you ignore the dog training itself! Put in some time and effort, mix in some patience, and you might be surprised at the kind of results you can illicit from this friendly breed. Don\u2019t expect a lot of brute force or power from a dog named the Miniature Schnauzer. A weight of 12-20 pounds is plenty for a male Miniature Schnauzer; 12-18 for females. If you want to get a small dog without a reputation for being prissy, the Miniature Schnauzer is perfect for you. Its coat and overall structure are more that of a traditional mid-sized dog, as well. The key issue for Miniature Schnauzers: fat. They frequently come across problems associated with high fat levels like diabetes, so be sure that you monitor your Miniature Schnauzer\u2019s weight and keep it exercising on a daily basis: it\u2019s good for both you and your dog. Expect your Miniature Schnauzer to live around 12-15 years depending on its individual health and lifestyle. Plenty of exercise is required for these dogs. As mentioned, high body fat is a major issue for Miniature Schnauzers, so you\u2019ll want to do the regulating for your dog. Make sure to use poultry and lean meats in its diet and don\u2019t over-feed it. Keeping your dog lean and healthy is important in the exercise department, so don\u2019t be afraid to give your dog a good workout even if it is a \u201cminiature\u201d breed. Miniature Schnauzers can be highly responsive to training but can also have a bit of an independent streak. Miniature Schnauzer is described by the American Kennel Club as \u201ca bright, friendly, trainable companion, small enough to adapt to apartment life but tireless enough to patrol acres of farmland.\u201d No one is immune to the many charms of these little guys, not even the pros! The coat of the Miniature Schnauzer is coarse and wiry on top, with soft guide hairs underneath it. The most distinct feature (in addition to standard colors) is the \u201cbeard\u201d and furry brows these dogs boast: you can trim it to adjust the appearance, but it definitely makes these pooches look like dapper dandies of the canine world. The colors of the coat are variations of white, grey, and black color combinations. Miniature Schnauzers sport a double coat that\u2019s wiry to touch and doesn\u2019t shed too much. This is a short-haired, low-maintenance breed and it will be a great choice if you are trying to avoid breeds that require long brushing sessions, intricate haircuts, and frequent visits to the groomer\u2019s salon. To keep a Mini Schnauzer\u2019s coat tidy and neat,  however, you\u2019ll have to have a grooming routine of your own. Their undercoat needs to be removed regularly with brushing (ideally a deshedding tool) and they\u2019ll require trimmings to keep them looking their best. That is especially true for their dashing facial hair- a bit of a trim can make a world of difference! Miniature Schnauzer puppies are cute, but be sure to pay attention to the coat if you plan on competing your dog: there are a finite number of official coat colors accepted in competition by regulators.

Unfortunately, it failed to live up to that potential and, as a result, was never fully developed. Developed from familiar breeds like the Newfoundland and the Caucasian Shepherd Dog, the Moscow Water Dog is a rare breed. The Moscow Water Dog is an extinct breed that was last seen sometime during the 1980s. The breed was commissioned by the Russian government and developed by the Russian Navy in an attempt to create the ultimate rescue dog. By combining the Newfoundland, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog, and the East European Shepherd, the Russian Navy succeeded in creating a large breed with a heavy double coat that could withstand rough weather and cold water. Unfortunately, the dog also had an aggressive nature and was more inclined to bite drowning victims than to rescue them. As such, the Russian Navy scrapped the breeding program and the breed went extinct sometime during the 1980s.

With his aggressive nature, it is possible that he also had a tendency toward independence and dominance.

Based on his breeding, however, it is likely that he stood somewhere between 26 and 30 inches and weighed over 100 pounds at maturity. The Moscow Water Dog was bred from the Newfoundland and several European shepherds. The Newfoundland is one of the gentlest, most family-friendly breeds out there. Unfortunately, the European shepherds used in the crossing are not known for their gentility. The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is a very large, aggressive breed prone to dog-aggression and known for snapping at strangers and anyone they perceive as a threat. The Newfoundland\u2019s gentle nature did not win out against the Caucasian Shepherd Dog\u2019s poor temperament and the Moscow Water Dog became known as an aggressive, unfriendly breed. This is what led the Russian Navy to halt its development. The Moscow Water Dog was only developed for a short time, so there is no concrete information about health problems affecting the breed. Due to his size, however, he was likely prone to musculoskeletal issues such as hip and elbow dysplasia as well as gastric torsion or bloat. With Newfoundland blood in his pedigree, cardiovascular problems, Addison\u2019s disease, and hypothyroidism are also possible. The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is also affected by heart problems and musculoskeletal issues, though they are generally healthy. This breed is also likely to have been at-risk for obesity. The average lifespan for the Moscow Water Dog was probably between 8 and 12 years. Bred from the Newfoundland and the Caucasian Shepherd Dog, the Moscow Water Dog likely had moderate needs for exercise.

Few people have even heard of the breed but that is for a good reason; this dog is a rare breed. There are actually less than a few thousand existing today. Fortunately, enthusiasts who love this breed are changing that. The Mudi (pronounced Moody), is a hardworking herding dog. Because he considers his family his flock, he is rather aloof and watchful when strangers are introduced. This breed usually makes good watchdogs. A medium-sized dog that was bred for herding, the Mudi is an exceptional companion as well as intelligent. Originating in Hungary, the Mudi is believed to have been in existence since the 1800s. Classification of this breed began in 1936. It is believed that the Mudi developed naturally and is the result of a variety of crosses between the Pumi, Puli and German Spitz style breeds. They were favored because of their great ability to herd both sheep and cows as well as be a watchful sentry for farm and home. Because the Mudi is an energetic and athletic dog, it is of the utmost importance that he be fed a high-quality diet of dry kibble. Dry food helps to maintain proper oral hygiene as it removes plaque and other debris caught between the dog\u2019s teeth. It also prevents tooth decay and bad breath. One of the great things about the Mudi is that he is easy to train. One of the great things about the Mudi is that he is easy to train. Training must be done in a positive way. Harsh training tactics do not work with this breed as they will quickly shy away from the training session. Treats work quite well and are an incentive for the dog to learn the behavior you are teaching. Housebreaking can be a problem so careful attention to the Mudi\u2019s signals for needing to go outdoors is important. Mudis excel in obedience work as well as in agility courses. Their intelligence and stamina also makes them great candidates for search and rescue work. Of course, they are perfect for herding trials too. Generally, the Mudi should weigh between 17 and 29 pounds and stand 15 to 18 \u00bd inches tall at the shoulder. Although this is considered standard, the weight and height can vary as true Mudis from Hungary tend to be a bit different. This is because they are more concerned with the dog\u2019s ability to herd and work than the adherence to this standard. Although the Mudi loves to play with his family, he is quite reserved with strangers. This is usually the case with herding breeds. With proper introduction and several visits, the dog will readily accept the stranger and become friendly and affectionate with him. The Mudi is good with his family\u2019s children as well as pets however; there have been occasions when the breed will attack other animals. Mudis tend to be vigorous barkers. In early days, they were sentries for both houses and farms. Barking to alert their families is a natural instinct for them. It\u2019s best to train them to be quiet on command however; this will not help if the breed will be left alone. Another concern within the breed is digging. Mudis love to dig and they are good at what they love to do! This can be problematic especially if they dig under a fence and get out. The Mudi is generally a very healthy breed of dog. There have been minimal incidences of hip dysplasia however; this can also be triggered because of the dog\u2019s environment. Eye problems such as cataracts have been seen in the breed. Epilepsy has recently been listed as an issue within the breed. Because of their general good health, the Mudi can live 12 to 14 years. Some have been reported to live far beyond that average. A bundle of energy and athleticism, the Mudi craves exercise just as he does food, water and air. He loves to play and is a great companion for those with active lifestyles. He will readily play ball and can quickly learn to play Frisbee. Of course, a nice jog through the park or hike in the woods would do the Mudi just fine. The Mudi tends to be a jumper. This is why he excels in agility courses. An adequate fenced area is absolutely necessary with this breed. Although he is on the small side, a six foot fence is best to contain him. Although the Mudi loves to play with his family, he is quite reserved with strangers. The American Kennel Club approved the Mudi into the Herding Group in 2015. The Mudi has a coat that is easy to maintain. A weekly brushing and seasonal bath will keep the dog looking fresh and clean. The coat on the dog\u2019s head and leg fronts is short while the remainder of the coat is wavy. This breed does not shed excessively. There are quite a few acceptable coat colors within the Mudi breed. The most frequently seen Mudi is black however; white, yellow, brown, gray and merle are also acceptable. Mudi puppies should begin being socialized as early as possible. Most breeders will have started this process for you. Early socialization will help to prevent shyness and aggression with strangers. It is of the utmost importance that the puppy be started on housebreaking immediately. They tend to be slow in this area so you must closely watch the puppy for signs that he should go outside.

The Native American Indian Dog is an attractive breed with a wild appearance very similar to their ancestors. Though the exact details of its origins are unknown, the Native American Indian Dog is thought to have similar heritage to the Dingo. In fact, many believe the Native American Indian Dog to be a missing link connecting to some of the first dogs domesticated by humans over 12,000 years ago. When various migrating groups and foreign traders visited North America, they brought with them native dogs from their homelands. The native inhabitants of North America bred these dogs with the Coyote that was native to North America, creating a distinct breed that came to be called the Common Indian Dog or the Common Native Dog. Throughout the 1700\u2019s, Native Americans all over the continent bred different dogs to achieve unique breeds with specific abilities. This being the case, the original Native American Indian Dogs were a conglomeration of different breeds rather than a single, unified breed. Modern breeders of the Native American Indian Dog strive to recreate the appearance and versatility of the dogs originally kept by Native Americans. Using historical documents left by missionaries, trappers and explorers, the Native American Indian Dog breed was founded and trademarked by Mrs. Karen Markel during the mid-1990s. The owner of Majestic View Kennels, Markel sought to achieve through selective breeding the most valuable traits of the original Native American Indian Dogs \u2013 intelligence, versatility, longevity and a hypoallergenic coat. Today, these dogs are prized for their hunting ability and are also used as therapy dogs, competition dogs and family pets.  The origins of the Native American Indian Dog, and thus his pedigree, are widely debated. This is a relatively recent and a very rare breed, so there\u2019s still not much we know about it, but there is one important thing about Native American Indian Dog\u2019s ancestry we do know about- these are NOT wolf hybrids. The stunning wild looks of the breed are just that- looks- and any breeder who says otherwise is a dubious one. Wolf hybrids or wolfdogs are the results of mating between a wolf and a domestic dog, and the Native American Indian Dog was developed only from domesticated dog breeds. So, what does this hybrid\u2019s family tree look like? The breed is commonly thought to have descended from the Common Indian Dog, dogs that were bred by Native Americans as a cross between the native Coyote and the dogs brought to the continent by traders and explorers. Breeders claim that it was the two dogs acquired from Native American tribes that started the breed. Then, multiple other wolf-like dog breeds were introduced to the gene pool, including Alaskan Malamute, Siberian Husky, German Shepherd, and Chinook. The exact ratio of breeds is not known, but the mix of these gorgeous dogs results in a truly unique canine with a good character to boot. Needless to say, breeding plays a crucial role- a good choice of breeding stock, responsible practices, and care for the health and wellbeing of the litter is essential for a well-balanced and healthy Native American Indian Dog. As a hybrid breed, the Native American Indian Dog is not recognized by the American Kennel Club or its international counterparts. Owing to this, puppies won\u2019t be eligible for official pedigree papers, but a responsible breeder should offer a certificate and/or health guarantee for their puppies. What does one feed a dog that looks like a wolf? You might think that Native American Indian Dog would prefer hunting for his own meals based off of his looks, but the truth is that these pooches love kibble same as the next pet dog. With a good choice of high-quality dry food for dogs, your new pet will be set up to thrive. Of course, you should choose kibble that\u2019s made from high-grade, natural ingredients with meat being the first item on the list. Avoid cheap brands full of fillers and artificial dyes and additives. As a rule of thumb, Native American Indian Dog does good on dry food adapted to his unique needs- formula for large, active dogs is usually a good fit. Also, make sure that the kibble is age-appropriate, as fast growing Native American Indian Dog puppies will have different needs than, say, an aging senior. Some Native American Indian Dog owners prefer going the raw food route or cooking their dog homemade meals. This can also be a good option for your pet, but only if you know what type of nutrients and ratios they need to stay healthy. Make sure to consult with a vet first if you plan on making your pet\u2019s food- otherwise, you could be risking serious damage to their health.

The color of the coat ranges from silver to black, often with a broken or tortoiseshell pattern. One of the most valuable qualities of this breed is its hypoallergenic coat which makes it a good breed for people who suffer from allergies. These dogs do shed their undercoat once a year in the spring so frequent brushing during this time will help to control shedding indoors.

Simply by looking at the impressive Neapolitan Mastiff, you can tell that he eats a lot. It is very important that he has a well-balanced, high-quality diet of dry food. Dry food is best because wet food can cause tooth decay, gum infection and bath breath in dogs. Because of the Neo\u2019s size, he should be fed twice daily or free fed to avoid gastric torsion, more commonly known as bloat. Gastric torsion can cause death, so smaller meals or free feeding is indicated. The Neapolitan Mastiff can be a stubborn dog. He needs a trainer who is confident and assertive. The Neapolitan Mastiff can be a stubborn dog. He needs a trainer who is confident and assertive. The Neo does not respond to aggressive training methods. Only positive techniques should be used and treats such as cookies or tidbits of meat are welcomed for a job well done. Obedience classes are beneficial as the Neo will become more socialized with other people and animals, which is necessary for this protective breed. The average male Neo weighs somewhere between 150 and 200 pounds and is from 26 to 31 inches tall. Females are smaller and tip the scales between 120 and 175 pounds while standing between 24 and 29 inches tall. The Neapolitan Mastiff\u2019s temperament should be rock solid and even. Although he is an excellent guardian; he is in no way, shape or form an attack dog. Even when the Neo appears to be relaxing or napping, he is still alert and very aware of what is going on around him and his family. This breed is reserved around strangers but will accept them once they have proven that they are not planning to harm his family. Because the Neapolitan Mastiff is huge and has a mind of his own, he can overtake the house and family in a heartbeat. Training will make the Neo understand his place in the home and make him a wonderful companion. Neos are predisposed to issues such as elbow and hip dysplasia. The occurrences of these debilitating problems can be decreased by not allowing the puppy to over exert himself or to jump on the furniture. Falls on slick surfaces can also exacerbate these problems. Other common issues are cherry eye, cleft palate, cardiomyopathy, fold dermatitis and demodicosis. The average life span of a Neapolitan Mastiff is from 8 to 10 years. The Neapolitan Mastiff doesn\u2019t require a ton of exercise. With a fenced yard, his patrolling duties will give him all of the exercise he needs. Brisk walks early in the morning or late in the evening will be beneficial as Neos can overheat in extreme temperatures. Although this breed makes a great companion for families with older kids, he is not the type of dog that will be out playing fetch or Frisbee. Neapolitan Mastiffs prefer lounging on the couch or sleeping in the bed with their families to doing anything athletic. The Neapolitan Mastiff\u2019s temperament should be rock solid and even. The American Kennel Club says this about the Neapolitan Mastiff: \u201cLarge and powerful, Neapolitan Mastiffs are known for their massiveness \u2013 massive head, massive bone, and massive body. Despite their fierce appearance and serious demeanor, Mastini are generally peaceful, steady dogs. The breed\u2019s trademark is the loose skin that covers their bodies, the abundant wrinkles and folds on the head and their rolling and lumbering gait.\u201d The AKC recognized the breed in 2004. The loose and heavily wrinkled skin of the Neapolitan Mastiff\u2019s face is covered with soft and velvety fur. A short coat of less than an inch in length covers the rest of his massive body. The coat can be tawny, tan brindle, mahogany, gray or most commonly, black. White markings on the head are a disqualification for the dog show ring, but have no bearing on the quality of companion they can be. The main part of grooming a Neo is regular cleansing of the folds. Without the folds being washed and dried properly, the dogs can get skin infections which are known as fold dermatitis. A weekly brushing is enough to keep the Neo\u2019s coat looking good. Baths are only needed seasonally or when the dog becomes malodorous. It should be mentioned that Neapolitan Mastiffs drool and they drool bucket loads. Slime will be on your floors, walls, furniture and all over you too! It\u2019s best to keep a washcloth with you to cut down on the amount of housecleaning you will need to do. When you see the drool stretching down from the dog\u2019s jowls, simply wipe it off with a cloth. Neapolitan Mastiff puppies are big, gorgeous and mischievous. They require early supervision to get them accustomed to a variety of people and situations. Puppy kindergarten classes should be started as soon as possible. Be sure he is properly vaccinated before allowing him to be around other animals. It is best to keep a Neo puppy crated at night as he very well might chew on electrical cords and cause harm to himself or your household.

In 1956 a live pair of New Guinea Singing Dogs was obtained by Albert Speer and J.P. Sinclair \u2013 the dogs were then sent to the Taronga Zoo in Australia for study. New Guinea Singing Dogs that are kept as pets have been captive-bred, though there are also conservation efforts in place aiming to preserve the breed in its native habitat. There is a great deal of controversy regarding the taxonomic classification of this breed. In 1958, the specimens at the Taronga Zoo were studied in depth and classified as a distinct species, given the name Canis hallstomi. Since 1958 the breed has been reclassified several times, often as a variant of the wild dingo and the domestic dog. Most commonly, the New Guinea Singing Dog is classified as either a breed of domestic dog or as a separate species entirely. Other researchers have proven the New Guinea Singing Dog to be a genetic match with the Australian dingo. The New Guinea Singing Dog is a medium-sized dog but also a highly active breed.

Boasting a love of water, children and people in general, the Newfoundland dog is one of the cuddliest things to come out of Canada. Originating during the 1700s, Newfoundlands are named for Newfoundland, Canada, its place of birth. Originally used a fishing dog, the Newfoundland was often used as a water retriever. Sporting heavy double coats and a sturdy build, the Newfoundland was made to be used in and around the Atlantic Ocean. On land, this breed was used as guard dogs and pack dogs. Newfoundland dogs were used by people across North America, and eventually it made its way into Europe. You\u2019ll often see the Newfoundland dog at obedience and water trials. This breed also makes an excellent rescue dog. Newfoundland dogs were bred from Labradors, Great Pyrenees, and Tibetan Mastiffs. It boasts the look of a Great Pyrenees with the abilities and coloration of the Labrador. The Newfoundland was recognized by the AKC in 1886. With a dog this big, you can expect a hearty appetite. Feed your Newf (as it is lovingly referred to) a diet of a diet rich in taurine, omega-3 fatty acids, arginine, calcium, phosphorous, and iodine. Fish is a great source for all these nutrients, and Newfoundland dogs love it (not surprising, seeing where the breed originated from). An extra-large dog with an extra-big heart, the Newfoundland will complete a household. Good news \u2013 you\u2019ll find Newfoundlands easy to train. You\u2019ll get the best results by using positive reinforcement training methods. Because it is a sensitive breed, loud, raised voices are discouraging, so use repetition and positive rewards for the fast results. When you start, training should only be taken on by one person initially. Other family members can learn to work with the dog later on. Be sure to make training sessions short and schedule them a few times a day, rather than one long stretch. Male Newfoundlands weigh 130 to 150 pounds, while females weigh 100 to 120 pounds. Even though it is big, the Newfoundland is a great house pet. If you have a small home, your dog will adapt and is careful of objects in its way.

As well, the Newfoundland can suffer from Von Willebrand\u2019s Disease, an abnormal bleeding disorder, as well as epilepsy. Newfoundland dogs have a life expectancy of 9 to 10 years. Newfoundlands are known to be one of the lazier breeds, so it\u2019s important that you monitor your dog\u2019s exercise. Regular exercise will keep health problems such as obesity at bay. The Newfoundland dog does best with short periods of play and exercise, but don\u2019t be afraid to take your dog for a slow jog. Since it loves the water, take your Newfoundland out for a swim. This breed doesn\u2019t do well in the heat, so watch for signs of heat stroke. Long periods of exercise, especially in the first two years of life, are not recommended.

He is large and strong, possessing a heavy coat to protect him from icy waters. Equally at home in the water and on land, today\u2019s Newfoundland competes in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, draft and water tests, and carting.\u201d Outfitted with a double coat, the Newfoundland\u2019s fur is medium length and straight or slightly wavy. Its under and outer coat have oils to keep dirt from penetrating the coat, and its tail, legs and belly often have longer hair. Its coat is usually white, black and gray, or brown or black. Use a stiff bristled brush or a pin brush for grooming, as its thick double coat can easily become matted. To ensure this doesn\u2019t happen, brush your Newfoundland several times a week. Its undercoat will shed in the spring and fall. Newfoundland puppies grow very quickly and can be quite uncoordinated (which is super cute to watch).

These large, wolf-like dogs have recently become popular for portraying the Dire Wolf in the HBO \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 series. The exact origins of the Northern Inuit Dog are unknown, but there are two stories relating to their history. In one story, the breed was founded by Eddie Harrison who crossbred several mixed-breed rescues with Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and German Shepherds to create the Northern Inuit Dog during the 1980s. In the other story, the Northern Inuit Dog is the product of a cross between Canadian Eskimo Dogs and Labrador Huskies that were brought to the UK from the USA during the late \u201970s with Alaskan Malamutes and German Shepherd Dogs. It\u2019s hard to say which one is accurate. There\u2019s a good chance that both stories are true and neither owner knew about the other. It\u2019s tricky to say, but the fact that there are even possible origin stories is more than is known about most hybrid dogs. Regardless the true origins of the breed, several groups of split to form their own breed groups from the Northern Inuit Society. In the UK there is the British Timber Dog Club, the British Inuit Dog Club and the Inuit Dog Association. These dogs are beloved by their owners and it\u2019s easy to see why.

As a recent breed that\u2019s still in the process of development, the Northern Inuit Dog is not recognized as an actual breed by official canine clubs. This means that the puppies won\u2019t be registered and there won\u2019t be any papers documenting their ancestry. It\u2019s a shame, but it in a few generations, that is guaranteed to change. \n\nThankfully, if you get a Northern Inuit puppy from a reputable breeder, there shouldn\u2019t be any reason to worry. These enthusiasts care about their dogs and strive to produce only healthy puppies with good qualities. This breed is treated with respect by so many reputable breeders that you can trust. Sadly, that\u2019s not true of every breeder. Whenever a hybrid breed becomes popular, backyard breeders try and make a quick profit off of these poor dogs. Avoid buying Northern Inuit Dog from any puppy mills, pet stores, or dubious sellers. By doing so, you\u2019ll know your new pet is healthy and hasn\u2019t been mistreated. Those disrespectful breeders should not be encouraged by your business.  Just like most dogs, the Northern Inuit tends to do best when fed high-quality dry dog food. Kibble is the safest option if you want to be sure you\u2019re meeting your pet\u2019s nutritional needs. Any other type of food (such as raw diet) must be approved by a vet before you give it to your pet. Keeping in mind that the Northern Inuit Dog is a naturally active breed, you should consider providing him with a dog food formulated for active dogs. You should also make sure that the food is formulated to meet the needs of large-breed dogs. Lastly, their kibble should suit their age. Pick a puppy, adult, or senior blend for different stages of your pet\u2019s life as your animal\u2019s dietary needs will change as they age. As always, make sure to consult with your vet about your dogs diet. While dog food manufacturers and puppy bloogers provide plenty of valuable information and guidelines, they should still be treated as guidelines and not gospel. Every dog is different after all. The only person qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is your vet. So, always check in with them before making any substantial changes to your doggie\u2019s diet. It\u2019s why you have a vet, after all. Never be afraid to use them. Northern Inuit Dogs are highly intelligent so they are capable of responding very well to training. Northern Inuit Dogs are highly intelligent, so they are capable of responding very well to training. However, you should know that these dogs do have a tendency to become a little stubborn or strong-willed without consistent and firm training. Of course, if you\u2019ve had previous experience with training dogs, this shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. It only takes a bit more patience than usual! Regardless, these dogs do require a strong leader in the family. Only a confident person who has a firm attitude can successfully train a Northern Inuit Dog. Positive reinforcement methods work wonders, so make sure to rely on treats and praise when rewarding a job well done- rather than using punishment for unwanted behaviors. Since these dogs are naturally independent and a little more difficult to train than other breeds, they are not the best fit for newbie dog owners. Without proper handling and good relationship with their owner, these dogs could be willful and exhibit various behavior issues. Of course, there are a variety of obedience training schools that could be used to help an inexperienced owner get the results they need. That could certainly help you throughout the process. Yet there\u2019s still nothing like the bonding that emerges from training your own pooch and that\u2019s why Northern Inuit Dogs should primarily belong to experienced owners who will be able to handle all the bumps along the rode. These dogs aren\u2019t for rookies and should be approached cautiously by anyone unprepared for the necessary training commitment.

They can develop separation anxiety when left alone too long. For this reason, it is best that Northern Inuit Dogs have another dog in the house as a companion. Otherwise that separation anxiety will lead to problematic behavior. The Northern Inuit Dog is a healthy breed for the most part, though responsible breeding practices are the only thing that can reduce the risk for congenital conditions. Like all dogs the breed is prone to several minor health issues including cataracts, epilepsy and hip dysplasia.

Even so, they remain a fairly rare breed and you can expect to put in a bit of effort before you track down a reputable breeder who has a litter for sale. More often than not, you\u2019ll have to be on a waitlist if you\u2019re serious about becoming a Northern Inuit owner. Once you get your new puppy home, you should start with the essentials. Socialization is incredibly important for young Northern Inuit Dog puppies and it should begin as soon as they are vaccinated. Keep in mind that play can be very rough while the puppies are young, but it should not be misinterpreted as aggression. Training should start early and kept consistent as the puppy matures to ensure that the dog does not become stubborn or willful.", "facts": " Not applicable Active singles, families with older children Friendly, stubborn, intelligent, gentle", "tags": "active dog, Dire Wolf, experienced dog owners, Game of Thrones, Northern Inuit Dog, Separation anxiety, wolf, "}, "norwegian buhund": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/norwegian-buhund/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/norwegian-buhund.jpg", "name": "Norwegian Buhund", "type": "dog", "text": "With a heritage steeped in Viking history, the Norwegian Buhund is brave, loyal and fearless.

An active and fun loving dog, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is not only favored by hunters but by energetic families as well. The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever originated on the island of Nova Scotia, Canada in the 1800s. A prized retriever of the duck hunters, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever was bred to entice ducks closer to the blinds so hunters would have a clean shot at them. The dog would then go get the duck and return it to the hunter. Today, this breed is a multi-purpose dog that makes a wonderful family pet. The smallest of the retrieving breeds, the Toller is believed to be the result of mixing numerous dogs. These breeds may include the Irish Setter, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Cocker Spaniel, Collies, Flat Coated Retrievers, a Spitz type of dog and Chesapeake Bay Retrievers. In 1945, a breed standard was created in order to develop a more uniform Toller. The Nova Scotia Duck Toller is an active dog. After all, he is a sporting breed. Tollers need a high-quality food formulated for energetic dogs. Dry food is best as it will help to cut down on oral health problems such as tooth decay and gum disease. Dry food also reduces bad breath. Always wanting to please their owners, Tollers are relatively easy to train. Always wanting to please their owners, Tollers are relatively easy to train. Positive training methods that include loads of praise and lots of treats work best for this breed. They are highly sensitive to harsh words and discipline so a calm and patient trainer is needed. Consistency in training is essential for the Toller to succeed in obedience. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers do well in many forms of canine competition. Of course, they excel in obedience trials but they also do well on agility courses. Agility is a great way to bond with the Toller as well as let him get the exercise he needs to stay healthy. Tollers should tip the scales between 35 and 50 pounds and be somewhere between 17 and 21 inches tall at the withers. In this breed, females are smaller than males. Duck Tollers are naturally curious and outgoing. They are friendly and affectionate toward visitors who are not threatening to their families and greet them like they were long lost friends. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are very adaptable. This breed enjoys traveling and isn\u2019t spooked by new places or situations. His easy going personality and flexibility make the Toller a wonderful companion for active families. Tollers bond quickly and fiercely with their families. This often leads to separation anxiety when they are left alone. Extensive exercise and plenty of toys will not help the anxiety issue. The Toller will do best in a home where someone is there for the vast majority of the day. The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a healthy breed compared to many of the other retrievers. Tollers can have eye issues including progressive retinal atrophy, Collie eye anomaly and cataracts. Addison\u2019s Disease and autoimmune thyroiditis have also been diagnosed in the breed. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers can live somewhere between 13 and 16 years!   Tollers are active dogs and need at least an hour\u2019s worth of extensive playtime daily or at the very least, a few brisk walks or jogs through the neighborhood. A fenced yard is a necessity for Tollers as they need to romp and run. Families with children find this breed to be excellent playmates for their kids. The Toller will happily play ball or fetch for hours, keeping both the dog and the kids active. Swimming is another activity loved by Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers. A home on the lake or one with a swimming pool would be like heaven for this breed. Water play and retrieving will keep the Toller in tiptop shape. Duck Tollers are naturally curious and outgoing. The American Kennel Club states: \u201cMedium sized, powerful and compact, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is the smallest of the retrievers. He developed in the early 19th century to toll, lure, and retrieve waterfowl. The playful action of the Toller retrieving a stick or ball along the shoreline arouses the curiosity of the ducks offshore. This lures them within gunshot range, and then the dog is sent out to retrieve the dead or wounded birds. Their water-repellant double coat is any shade of red, often with white markings\u201d. The AKC acknowledged the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever in 2003. It is in the Sporting Group. Duck Tollers have a double coat that\u2019s medium in length and water repellent. The coat should be straight with the exception of the back, which may be wavy. They usually have white tail tips, which is desirable as it aids in the hunter\u2019s ability to see the dog\u2019s location in the water. The coat is red and may sport other white markings on the head and chest. Grooming is no problem for Toller owners. A good brushing once a week is enough to keep the coat in great shape. Bathing should be done on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis. This is especially true if the dog plays in a swimming pool or clean lake water. Toller puppies are cute but they do need to be socialized and attend puppy obedience classes. This will give them a head start and foundation for all the things they will be trained to do later. This breed takes well to crate training so housebreaking should be a breeze.

These dogs are similar in appearance to other pointers, having a white coloration with brown markings as well as a powerful build and stable temperament. Though developed for hunting, these dogs are also family-friendly. They tend to be very quiet indoors but outside they let loose and show off their speed and stamina. Also known as the Old Danish Pointing Dog, the Old Danish Pointer is a medium-sized pointing breed developed in Denmark. The origins of the Old Danish Pointer can be traced back to 1710 when Morten Bak crossed a collection of gypsy dogs with local farm dogs to create his own pure breed. He took eight generations of gypsy dogs to create a piebald white and brown dog he called the Bakhound, or Old Danish Pointer. The farm dogs used in the crossing were referred to as Bloodhounds by local farmers, but they are more likely descendants of the St. Hubert Hound than the modern Bloodhound breed. The gypsy dogs used in the crossing were likely descendant from Spanish Pointing Dogs of various breeds. The Old Danish Pointer was developed by crossing gypsy dogs with local farm dogs in Denmark. Because the Old Danish Pointer is a large-breed dog, he should be fed a high-quality adult dog food formulated for breeds of his size. These recipes are typically rich in protein to support lean muscle mass with moderate fat content for energy. If you plan to use your Old Danish Pointer for hunting, an active or working breed formula may be more appropriate. These recipes are rich in protein and higher in fat to provide extra energy. As a hunting breed, the Old Danish Pointer is trainable. As a hunting breed, the Old Danish Pointer is trainable. These dogs are intelligent and hardworking, plus they actively enjoy the work they do. This breed should be started early with socialization and training, though he typically learns fast and is eager to please. Positive reinforcement works well for this breed and he forms a strong bond with his owner. Just make sure to keep your training sessions short and fun so he doesn\u2019t lose interest. Though often described as a medium-sized breed, the Old Danish Pointer is technically a large-breed dog that weighs 55 to 75 pounds at maturity and stands 20 to 24 inches tall. Males of the breed are slightly larger than females. The Old Danish Pointer has a steady temperament as well as great determination and courage. These dogs are not overly active \u2013 they tend to be quiet and calm in the home but active outdoors. This breed bonds quickly with family and gets along very well with children. Generally speaking, he makes a great family pet. This breed may be somewhat unsure of strangers, but he is not aloof or aggressive. These dogs may chase small pets, though socialization can help to curb this behavior. The Old Danish Pointer is generally a very healthy breed, though all dogs are prone to certain health problems. This breed may be prone to musculoskeletal issues like hip and elbow dysplasia as well as eye problems like entropion, ectropion, and distichiasis. They are also prone to ear infections and field injuries. The average lifespan for the Old Danish Pointer is 12 to 14 years. Though the Old Danish Pointer is very quiet and calm indoors, he has high needs for exercise. This breed requires at least an hour of vigorous activity per day and will appreciate having a fenced outdoor space in which to run. The Old Danish Pointer has a steady temperament as well as great determination and courage. The Old Dutch Pointer is not yet accepted by the AKC but has been admitted into the Foundation Stock Service. The breed is recognized, however, by the FCI as a Continental Pointing Dog. The Old Danish Pointer has a short, dense topcoat that is harsh in texture. It should never appear long or fluffy and the skin itself is close-fitting, though looser on the head and neck. The breed has a piebald coloration of white with brown markings, including large patches and small spots. The average litter size for the Old Danish Pointer is 4 to 6 puppies. Because this breed is technically a large breed based on its adult weight, puppies should be fed a high-quality large-breed puppy food for the first 12 months. This will ensure that they get enough protein to develop strong muscles without growing so fast that they become predisposed to musculoskeletal issues in adulthood.

Typically we associate longer, puffier coats as belonging to those in the toy group or indoor dogs. But the Old English Sheepdog has a stronger personality than that and can be considered a durable, loving companion. Its strong personality makes it flexible to a number of social situations and they generally can be considered a \u201chappy\u201d breed that is able to make the best of new or unusual situations. Of course, with a firmer dog a firmer owner will be required. You can\u2019t treat the Old English Sheepdog like a toy breed or ready-made companion on level with the pack leader of the house or else the Old English Sheepdog will begin to think its boundaries are larger than they really are. This is the case for many stable, sturdy breeds of dog and the Old English Sheepdog is no exception. If that sounds good to you, than the OES might just be the right breed for you. The Old English Sheepdog can be considered a durable, loving companion. These dogs are, of course, English, having originated in the western section of that country as an aid to many farmers who worked exclusively off the land. As a sheepdog, the Old English Sheepdog was definitely a sheep herder and assisted with handling the other animals on the farm, perhaps a good explanation for why it has a generally assertive, easy-going personality that gets along well with others. The tails of the Old English Sheepdog would actually be clipped off for tax purposes in old England, giving this breed the nickname of \u201cbobtails.\u201d That\u2019s not all that would come off this breed \u2013 when the sheep were being sheared, the Old English Sheepdog was often clipped as well to produce good insulating blankets and other materials around the house. There are a few theories on the pedigree of the Old English Sheepdog. According to the American Kennel Club, the OES is \u201cis believed to have descended from the Scotch Bearded Collie and the Russian Owtchar.\u201d Other theories give relation to the Poodle and even the Deerhound. Whatever the pedigree, there\u2019s no denying the breed that has come before us: a thick-haired, strong and happy breed with a generally assertive personality. This probably reflects their general pedigree as workers and sheep herders, and certainly reflects their relatively clean lineage of both service to farmers and companionship. A good diet for the Old English Sheepdog will include lean meats and whole foods. While this dog is relatively larger, keep in mind that it is still about a half or a third size of most humans and requires a similarly small diet. It can be hard to tell if your dog is gaining weight because of its thick coat. The temperament of the Old English Sheepdog is quite friendly and happy, and although they have a reputation as being strong-willed at times. As with many assertive and sometimes strong-willed breeds, the training will be crucial. Old English Sheepdogs come from a clear hierarchy both in dog packs and in the farming structure in western England, which means they need to feel like they have a place within your home\u2019s own hierarchy. Good training, setting boundaries, and even giving your Old English Sheepdog a job to perform are all good ways of establishing this hierarchy. A particularly weak-willed owner can sometimes find the Old English Sheepdog to be a handful, especially as the dog gets older and becomes more set in its ways. These dogs can be deceptively heavy, perhaps because some people expect them to be all hair. As it is, males can reach up to 85 pounds and females aren\u2019t far behind at up to 60 pounds. The temperament of the OES is actually quite friendly and happy, and although they have a reputation as being strong-willed at times, a properly trained OES will get along with all members of the family, even children. Because of its strong herding instinct, it may at times attempt to herd you and other people, so it must be taught at all times that it is not appropriate to herd humans. Imagine the message of \u201cit\u2019s okay to herd us\u201d sends \u2013 you aren\u2019t exactly the pack leader in that case. These dogs frequently see cases of Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia, as well as hip dysplasia and cataracts. Expect your OES to live about 10-12 years on average. The OES certainly requires a good amount of space to really feel like it\u2019s at home, which is why the old English farms were perfect places for these dogs to feel needed. These dogs have a good tolerance for walking and even running, but keep in mind that you\u2019re taking your dog for a walk and it\u2019s not taking you for a walk. Because of its strong herding instinct, the Old English Sheepdog may  attempt to herd you. Says the American Kennel Club: \u201cthe intelligent and agile Old English Sheepdog (OES) can easily complete any demanding task asked of him by a shepherd or drover.\u201d The coat is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Old English Sheepdog. Big and puffy, the coat can be a number of colors, including gray, blue, and will often have a white section or spots. The texture could be described as \u201cshaggy,\u201d and this is certainly a prototype for a shaggy-looking dog. The problem with this coat is that it can lead to grooming and skin problems if not properly cared for at least about three times a week, so if you don\u2019t enjoy that kind of work with your dog, you\u2019ll want to find something with a shorter coat. Puppies should be properly trained to understand that humans should not be herded. Other boundaries must be set and it must be establish that humans take precedence in your household.

However, they are in no way a low-maintenance breed for the casual dog owner and require the care and attention of a dedicated and experienced owner. A large and powerful scent hound, Otterhounds have a history spanning more than a 1,000 years. Sadly, they are also one of the most endangered breeds of dog in the world today with only around 1,000 specimens alive worldwide. Otterhounds are unique from other scent hounds because they have the capability to hunt both on land and in water. They are characterized by their large, webbed feet and thick double coats \u2013 the first layer which is soft and waterproof, and the second which is long and scraggly. The Otterhound is also a powerfully built dog with a long striding gait and is able to navigate rough terrain during long and strenuous hunts. Their sense of smell is so keen that it is said that Otterhounds are able to track the scent of otters in water as well as on land. A hardworking and athletic dog, the Otterhound is a determined hunter. These dogs are also highly intelligent and independent, and if not provided with firm leadership they can turn willful and stubborn. However, they are extremely playful and loving and can make excellent companions for the right owner. A hardworking and athletic dog, the Otterhound is a determined hunter. Although the Otterhound\u2019s exact origins are unclear, it is believed that the breed originated in France. The breed got its name from the early 19th century British fishermen who started using them to hunt otters that were wreaking havoc on the local fish populations. It is believed that this breed was created by crossing Bloodhounds with rough-haired terriers, Harriers and French Griffons. In the book \u201cDogs and All About Them,\u201d it is remarked that Otterhounds possess a Bulldog\u2019s courage, a Newfoundland\u2019s strength in water, a Pointer\u2019s nose, a Retriever\u2019s sagacity, the stamina of a Foxhound, the patience of a Beagle, and the intelligence of a Collie. Otterhounds are voracious eaters and should be fed on two meals of high-quality dry or canned food each day. Care should be taken to not over-feed these dogs. Due to their large barrel chests they are also known to suffer from bloat and gastric torsion. Otterhounds were never bred to be kept as companions and are therefore not the easiest of dogs to train. Otterhounds were never bred to be kept as companions and are therefore not the easiest of dogs to train. Training them requires a firm hand and a great deal of patience. They are also a good-natured breed and do not respond well to harsh training methods. A firm but gentle approach always works best with this breed. It is also important that an Otterhound\u2019s owner display consistent leadership as this dog can turn willful and stubborn if faced with a meek or passive owner. Otterhounds are a hefty breed and weigh in at around 95 to 125 pounds. Otterhounds are an extremely hardworking breed of dog and require a great deal of mental and physical stimulation to lead a well-balanced life. They are also highly independent and can sometimes try to assume control of their human \u201cpack\u201d if not provided with firm and consistent leadership. This makes them unsuitable for weak or inexperienced dog owners. They are however a very affectionate and loving breed and get along incredibly well with children. They also get along well with other dogs and pets. However, it is important to provide them with rules, boundaries and limitations early on as they have a very powerful hunting drive that can be triggered by the presence of smaller animals. They are also a heavily scent-driven breed of dog and can easily get fixated with various scents around them. Therefore it is important to keep the dog\u2019s tracking instincts in check when taking it out for walks. Otterhounds also have large, booming barks that can carry for quite a distance. But since they are extremely amiable towards strangers, they generally do not make good guard dogs. Like most large, rapid growing breeds, Otterhounds occasionally suffer from joint problems such as hip and elbow dysplasia. They are also known to suffer from ear infections due to the long, droopy shape of their ears. Otterhounds can also sometimes suffer from epilepsy and this is considered to be a hereditary ailment. The average lifespan of an Otterhound is around 10 to 13 years. Otterhounds have a great deal of stamina and require strenuous and daily exercise. They make excellent jogging and hiking partners and can keep up a steady trot for the better part of the day. When not exercised sufficiently they can sometimes turn destructive. Otterhounds are an extremely hardworking breed of dog and require a great deal of mental and physical stimulation to lead a well-balanced life. The AKC has this to say about the Otterhound: \u201cThe Otterhound, a scent hound, is unique among hounds because of his rough, double coat and substantial webbed feet. He uses these features to hunt on both land and water. With his large, strong body and inquisitive nose, the Otterhound is willing to work all day.

The Otterhound\u2019s coat needs to be brushed at least once a week and washed occasionally. They are average shedders and should be checked for ear infections regularly. Otterhound puppies should be socialized with dogs and other animals at a very young age. Their training should also start as early on as possible.

Okay, so knowing that a breed is a Spaniel won\u2019t exactly help you to picture it. But you\u2019ll easily recognize a Papillon simply by taking a look at it: its characteristic \u201cbutterfly\u201d look with raised ears and a small head give it one of the most unique and cutest faces of all the dog breeds you\u2019ll come across. A white coat with patches of a variety of colors also mark this breed and give it that characteristic \u201clap\u201d dog or \u201ctoy\u201d dog look. But there\u2019s a lot more to this breed of dog than its looks. The Papillon doesn\u2019t only come in a variety of colors, but it has an athletic ability that sometimes gets obscured by its relatively small stature. Heck, there\u2019s nothing \u201crelative\u201d about its small stature: at around 5-10 pounds, this is one of the smallest dogs around. But many people will claim that their pup exhibits characteristics like being a big dog in a small dog\u2019s body. For this reason, this can be one of the most spirited, unusual toy dog personalities you come across \u2013 and many times, this is a good thing. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the Papillon to discover why it\u2019s become such a popular toy dog both in competition and as a house pet. The Papillon thinks it\u2019s a big dog in a little dog\u2019s body. Like many dogs, we can trace the Papillon\u2019s history by looking at European paintings that depict nobility with their favorite dogs. Typically, powerful dogs or toy dogs make this kind of appearance, and the Papillon is no exception, having been painted into portraits during Renaissance Italy. While we can\u2019t say for certain that these Papillons exhibit the same characteristics we know and love today, we can tell that there were dogs similar to the breed going hundreds of years back into the past. It\u2019s also important to remember that Papillons were popular in England, France, and Belgium, as well. Unsurprisingly, this toy dog was a hit among certain royalty. It\u2019s said that Marie Antoinette would carry hers around with her, although it can\u2019t be verified if the breed she carried around was really a Papillon. But the fact that this doesn\u2019t seem like such a tall tale suggests that many members of both royalty and nobility were enamored with the little dogs. Today, the Papillon is an accessible dog to just about anyone with the ambition to go out and find one. Given that the French translation of Papillon is \u201cbutterfly,\u201d it must be assumed that the true Papillon came out of the butterfly-like appearance of its face-and-ears configuration. This means that the ancestors of the Papillon probably had similar traits but might not have been quite as well-developed. Dogs like the Titian Spaniel, for example, have shown similar characteristics while remaining a separate breed from the Papillon. First recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1935, the Papillon eventually won \u201cBest in Show\u201d at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1999, giving the Papillon a new hint of prominence in the toy and Spaniel groups. Same like any other dog, a Papillon needs a well-balanced diet that offers varied nutrition. The only difference is that they need much less of it than your average-sized pooch! For your Papillon, choose premium dry food for dogs. The kibble should be made from high-grade materials and formulated so to meet their unique needs. Usually, toy breed formulas are a perfect match: they offer the right ratio of nutrients for a dog of Papillon\u2019s size and activity level. Additionally, you should make sure that the kibble is appropriate for their age: puppies, adults, and seniors have different requirements. In most cases, these dogs need only a half to one cup of kibble per day- it\u2019s important not to overfeed them. Split their daily dose of kibble into two meals and stick to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, as these dogs can become overweight quickly.  The Papillon is easy to get moving and is playful and active. The Papillon is a highly trainable breed. Not only that these petite dogs are quite smart, but they\u2019re also eager to please their owners. This combination of traits ensures success with any training- of course, with the right approach. Reward-based training methods work best with the Papillon. Once they figure out that they\u2019ll get a tasty treat or praise from their owner when they follow a command, they\u2019ll become obedient little angels. However, make sure to be firm and consistent- positive reinforcement training works best when you position yourself as the leader of the pack. Most pet owners start with the basics, such as potty training and basic commands. But, with the Papillon, your training efforts don\u2019t have to stop with apartment manners and obedience.  They are active and athletic dogs, and you can utilize that in your training. Papillon excels in dog sports such as agility or obedience competitions. With the right person by their side, there\u2019s no limit to what these tiny dogs can learn and achieve! A weight of around 5-10 pounds is typical for this breed, which means that even small fluctuations can mean a lot over the years. Known as athletic, capable of plenty of exercise, and being a big dog in a little dog\u2019s body, these dogs might have a high tolerance for exercise but it\u2019s best to remember just how far a few miles can be for one of these dogs as opposed to a dog with longer legs. This dog is easy to get moving and is playful and active, so a good exercise regimen will be key. Like almost every dog breed, there are certain health issues to look out for in the Papillon. Puppies could be born with a genetic problem such as open fontanel (soft spot on head) that doesn\u2019t fully close and leaves them vulnerable to fatal head injury. Additionally, this breed can be at an increased risk for hypoglycemia, progressive retinal atrophy, and collapsed trachea. Nevertheless, this toy dog breed is among the healthier ones of its group.  As a small dog breed, the Papillon will also be prone to issues that affect all dogs of this size. Its teeth, for example, will quite easily develop tartar, leading to early tooth loss. Displaced kneecap (patellar luxation) and proneness to obesity are also a potential reason for concern. A life expectancy of around 13-16 years is a side effect of its small stature and a great bonus if you want to raise a dog like this along with your children. Don\u2019t short-change your Papillon\u2019s exercise simply because they\u2019re small: try to gauge its reactions to exercise and build a challenging exercise regimen that it can handle. When your pet is a puppy, be sure not to wear them out because of potential joint issues down the road. This is typically a bigger concern for larger dogs that will grow more than the Papillon does, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind nonetheless. The Papillon is a small, friendly, elegant toy dog with a fine boned structure. The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cThe Papillon is a small, friendly, elegant toy dog with a fine boned structure. He is light and dainty, yet still lively, and is distinguished from other breeds by his beautiful, butterfly-like ears.\u201d The Papillon boasts a soft, flowing coat that gives them an air of grace. These dogs are always particolored, which means that the \u201cbase\u201d is white, with patches in color. Common combinations are white with black, fawn, red, or brown. The fine, light and generally longer coat means a degree of grooming but seeing breed does not carry an undercoat, grooming is minimal. As a rule of thumb, a Papillon will need a good brushing once or twice a week, to prevent matting and tangling.  As these are toy dogs, their litters tend to be small. Usually, a Papillon will give birth to one to three puppies, which can impact the price of the puppies. If you are buying Papillon puppies from a breeder, you can expect them to cost anywhere from $800 to $3,000. Papillon puppies are tiny and fragile, so you will have to handle them with extra care.

This confusion has gone on for too long and it\u2019s time to set things straight. While, it may be similar to the Jack Russell Terrier, the Parson Russell Terrier is a breed all its own. It\u2019s time that everyone finally stop making this mistake. Both breeds are wonderful and both breeds are unique. In fact, the Parson Russell Terrier was distinguished as its own breed in 2003. But while the name is different, the essential look, temperament, and genuine qualities inherent to this breed have not been shaken in the slightest. This is a smaller dog with the bright and energetic personality that many expect from smaller dogs, with a high propensity toward playfulness and confidence. They are little sweethearts who brighten up every home. But is a Parson Russell Terrier for you? There\u2019s a good chance it is, considering how durable and flexible this breed can be. However, given how strong the Parson Russell Terrier\u2019s personality can be, it\u2019s only a recommended breed for people who understand dog training and what it means to behave like a leader with their dog. If you have experience in leading dogs, then you can unlock the great aspects of the Parson Russell Terrier\u2019s personality and enjoy a cheerful friend. If not, you have to be careful or else the Parson Russell Terrier will start leading you! To find out whether or not you\u2019ll need to bring a Parson Russell Terrier into your home, keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away. We are about to reveal everything that you could possibly want to know about this incredible little pup! It may be similar to the Jack Russell Terrier, but the Parson Russell Terrier is a breed all its own. Originally named after a Clergyman, the Jack Russell Terrier, as it was previously known, was a \u201cgame\u201d dog that originally went after foxes. This required not only agility and smarts, but significant diggings skills, which many Parson Russell Terriers retain to this day. Because this was generally a working breed of dog, the original Jack Russell Terriers could have a great deal of size variance, depending on the jobs  that they were expected to perform. Today, through careful breeding, that size variance has generally subsided and the Parson Russell Terrier has become a relatively smaller size of dog. As it happens, the Parson Russell Terrier can still often be used as a working dog in situations like farms, stables, and can still be considered a good hunting companion depending on the type of game you\u2019re after. It all comes down to careful training and socialization from an early age to ensure that your pup grows into the working dog that you are looking for. The pedigree of the Parson Russell Terrier includes the Jack Russell Terriers of the 19th century, but many people also suggest that the modern breed has included ancestors like the Welsh Corgi (which is a smaller dog and could explain the modern breed\u2019s stable, but small, size). It\u2019s hard to say precisely how far back this lineage goes. Although the name has changed from Jack Russell to Parson Russell, the essential breed of terrier has remained the same, especially considering the name change was only instituted in 2003. This name change has not come with a change in pedigree, and modern Parson Russells can still be considered to have the same essential pedigree as the Jack Russells that immediately preceded them. This is a new breed and while there is still some confusion about that, it\u2019s time to finally recognize Parson Russells as their own unique doggo, independent of his forbearer. A very small dog means a dog that can easily pack on the pounds in a hurry, so it\u2019s important to feed a dog protein to keep it full. Meat like hard-boiled eggs, poultry, beef, and even lamb all make great additions to their diet, especially incorporated into other ingredients snuck in for nutrition\u2019s sake. If you are in any way concerned about establishing or altering the diet of your Parson Russell, it\u2019s always wise to check in with a veterinarian first. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still just guidelines and won\u2019t necessarily apply to every dog. All dogs are different after all, each with their own needs. The only person qualified to to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is a vet. So always depend on their expertise before filling up your dog\u2019s bowl with anything new. The Parson Russell Terrier has a very strong and noticeable personality. Generally considered to be confident and strong-willed, the Parson Russell Terrier will be receptive to training if you can demonstrate patient and effective leadership. It\u2019s not difficult, however, to let the Parson Russell Terrier get under your skin and eventually find a way to win dominance over you, so be sure that you understand the principles of leadership before starting your dog on a training regimen. Rules and limitations will be important for the Parson Russell Terrier so that it understands it does not have permission to go everywhere in your home like you do. You must establish yourself as the alpha in your relationship to get the training results that you crave from your Parson Russell Terrier. However, it\u2019s important to do this with a soft touch. All training should be rooted primarily in positive reinforcement and treat-based encouragement. Relying too heavily on punishment and negative reinforcement is closer to abuse than training and will never get the results that you crave. Training any dog is a tremendous responsibility, so take it seriously. There\u2019s no harm in enrolling your pup in a training school either. Not only will that make training easier for you, but it will help socialize your dog as well. At a general weight of 14-18 pounds, this is quite a small dog; don\u2019t let it bully you! Also, be sure that you feed it properly and understand that a small dog requires a similarly small diet. The Parson Russell Terrier has a very strong and noticeable personality. When properly disciplined, this personality will be cheerful, energetic, playful, and confident. In short, everything that anyone could possibly want from a dog. The Parson Russell Terrier\u2019s personality is a great combination for a true dog lover, which helps explain the special breed\u2019s general popularity in the United States. It\u2019s important that this dog have a strong personality, as this is indicative of it having a healthy personality for its breed. Over-aggressiveness and insecurity should both be avoided. This dog is also susceptible to developing the dreaded \u201clittle dog syndrome.\u201d Nobody wants that, which is the primary reason to start training and socialize a Parson Russell Terrier as early as possible. Do not let those early and impressionable puppy days go to waste. Generally, eye problems, deafness, and joint issues will plague this breed, especially joint issues that are generally well-known to be \u201csmall dog\u201d joint problems, such as Legg Perthes. It\u2019s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a vet (especially as your dog ages into their senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. A healthy dog in general, it can live in excess of 15 years, among the highest on the dog life expectancy spectrum. This dog loves plenty of space and requires a good amount of thorough daily exercise. A properly-exercised dog has had his chance to point his energy somewhere and this means it will generally have a more pleasant and balanced personality. If they don\u2019t burn off their energy through productive exercise every day, they will find other ways to burn off their excess energy that won\u2019t be quite as pleasant.  This dog will enjoy a good open area like a park or even a country home, and can be both a city and country dog but will definitely require regular exercise in either case. Outgoing and friendly, the Parson is tenacious in the field and affectionate in the home. Says the American Kennel Club of this breed: \u201cOutgoing and friendly, the Parson is tenacious in the field and affectionate in the home. No matter the venue, the breed is filled with energy, so he requires regular exercise and attention. Although good with children, he does not tolerate rough handling from toddlers.\u201d Minimal grooming with this dog is required, such as a little brushing with a firm brush. The coat is generally easy to take care of, and when these dogs are presented at shows the coat must be \u201cstripped.\u201d These dogs should learn their boundaries from a young age, but should also be given the opportunity to explore and socialize with people and even other animals so that they don\u2019t grow an unhealthy understanding of others.", "facts": " AKC Terrier Families with children, active singles and seniors, houses with yards Friendly, bold, intelligent, independent", "tags": "joint issues, Legg Perthes, Parson Russell Terrier, small breeds, stripped coat, "}, "patterdale terrier": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/patterdale-terrier/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/patterdale-terrier.jpg", "name": "Patterdale Terrier", "type": "dog", "text": "The Patterdale Terrier is a compact, working breed that was originally bred to hunt foxes and other vermin. While there isn\u2019t as much need for full time hunting dogs these days, the Patterdale Terrier has proven to quite a popular bet. These terriers are particularly popular in Europe, though they are starting to become more common in the United States and other countries. Europeans couldn\u2019t keep this beautiful animal to themselves for long. These pups are far too easy to love for that.   What makes these dogs so popular, in addition to their irresistibly attractive appearance, is the fact that they are versatile and adaptable. These dogs are capable of completing just about any task that they are assigned. But, what\u2019s even more so appealing is that they make great pets, too. These dogs fit in well to just about any home and have proven themselves to be fun and loving companions for a variety of owners. Smart, spunky, and full of energy- the Patterdale Terrier might be small, but his spirit certainly isn\u2019t. These terriers might not be as tenacious and driven as they were in the early beginnings of the breed, when they were exclusively selected for hunting, but traces of these traits still survive. While their size and sweet nature might fool you into thinking that they could live happily as a lapdog, that\u2019s far from the truth. Even in the role of a pet and companion, the Patterdale Terrier will need a lot of exercise to stay happy and healthy.  Still curious to find out if this rare British breed is the right choice for you? Well, the good news is that you\u2019ve come to the right place. Keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away. Everything that you could possibly want to know about these remarkable animals is about to be revealed. So what are you waiting for?!  Read on to learn all about the feisty Patterdale Terrier. By the end of this article, you just might find yourself running out to the nearest Patterdale Terrier breeder to add another member to your family.  The Patterdale Terrier is a compact, working breed that was originally bred to hunt foxes and other vermin. Another common name for the Patterdale Terrier is the Fell Terrier, owing to his place of origin. Fell Terriers are a specific type of small working terriers that all originate from Fell country in England. That makes the Patterdale Terrier quite possibly the group\u2019s most representative breed to date. Breeder Joe Bowman of Ullswater Hunt is credited with developing the breed through careful line breeding. He is to be commended for his extraordinary work. However, he\u2019s not the only one responsible for the look and behavior of the Patterdale Terrier as we know it today. The work he did on creating these dogs in the first place was taken on by various UK breeders, which popularized and standardized the breed. There\u2019s a rich history to this particular pup. There are many breeders involved in developing the dog that we know today and pooch lovers everywhere are forever grateful.  The Patterdale Terrier was first brought to the U.S. in 1978, but it is still a rare and fairly unknown breed outside of his homeland. However, in recent years, it seems that the popularity of the Patterdale Terrier is growing, all thanks to their exceptional qualities as working dogs and pets. Soon, this breed may well be just as popular on this side of the pond as in Europe. Only time will tell, but given how delightful these dogs are, our hopes remain high.   The history of the Patterdale Terrier breed is not all that clear: these dogs were created through efforts of various breeders throughout many years, so there\u2019s no certainty what other breeds were used to create this tenacious little terrier. Some sources indicate that Joe Bowman, the breeder who people believe was first to produce a litter of these dogs, crossed a blue-black Border Terrier with a black and tan Lakeland Terrier to develop the Patterdale Terrier. His work was continued by other enthusiasts that linebred the breed further, to standardize the looks.  Even though his remarkable hunting skills made the Patterdale Terrier very popular, first in England and then in many other countries, these dogs are not recognized by AKC, UKC, or any other major canine club. Their appearance still remains too unpredictable in comparison to other purebreds. As a result, these puppies won\u2019t have their own pedigree papers- but be sure to ask for a health guarantee if you\u2019re buying a Patterdale Terrier puppy. If you encounter a breeder unwilling to provide that sort of guarantee, then it is unlikely they are a reputable breeder and they should not be trusted.  The Patterdale Terrier is no different than any other dog when it comes to their dietary needs. Like every canine, they also need a healthy and well-balanced diet to stay in optimal form and lead long and healthy lives. To make sure their nutritional needs are met, opt for premium kibble for small, active dogs. Additionally, make sure that the dry food you\u2019re choosing is appropriate for their age group- puppy, adult, or senior. If you are in any way concerned about establishing or altering your dog\u2019s diet, then it is always worth seeking out the advice of a veterinarian. While pet blogs and dog food manufacturers provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still just guidelines and should not be treated as gospel. All dogs are different after all, each with their own needs. The only person qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is a vet. So always rely on their expertise before making any specific changes to what goes into your pup\u2019s food dish. Developed to hunt foxes, Patterdale Terriers have strong hunting instincts which can be put to use in a variety of ways. Developed to hunt foxes, Patterdale Terriers have strong hunting instincts which can be put to use in a variety of ways. These little dogs are intelligent and tend to respond well to training, but they do have a bit of an independent streak in them. This being the case, you will need to train your dog with a firm and consistent hand \u2013 use plenty of positive reinforcement to cement his training. You must establish yourself as the alpha in the relationship, but it\u2019s still important to focus on positive training techniques only. Anything less is closer to abuse than training and should be avoided at all costs. That will never yield the results you seek. In addition to obedience training, Patterdale Terriers can also be trained to hunt, to race and to participate in all manner of dog sports. In recent years, the Patterdale Terrier has begun to excel in Flyball and other areas of dog agility. A Patterdale Terrier named Chip was part of the Flyball Team that won the 2012 European Flyball Championship as well as the 2012 British Flyball Championships. The average weight of a mature Patterdale Terrier in the United States weighs between 11 and 13 lbs. (5 to 6 kg), though the UKC standard for the breed accepts a weight anywhere between 15 and 30 lbs. The Patterdale Terrier is a working breed, so his focus will always be on doing the job he is assigned to do. These dogs are very smart and have excellent instincts and hunting abilities \u2013 they are also very tough despite their small size. Given its instincts, the Patterdale Terrier also makes a good watchdog, though he is unlikely to be as yappy as other terriers are. The main thing to realize with this breed is that they can be independent and strong-willed. It is essential that you start obedience training as young as possible because these dogs can be tricky to train. Because Patterdale Terriers are so strong-willed, they are prone to developing Small Dog Syndrome. The key to preventing your dog from developing behavioral problems is to maintain a firm and consistent hand in training \u2013 your dog should never doubt that you are the boss but you do not need to be cruel to assert your position as such. It\u2019s a delicate balance to achieve, but the only way to properly train a pup. The Patterdale Terrier is generally a healthy breed, though it may be prone to certain health problems including conjunctivitis, cataracts and cuts or scrapes related to hunting injuries. As always, it is important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with your vet (especially as your pooch ages into his senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as quickly as possible. The average life expectancy of this breed is 11 to 13 years. Like most terriers, the Patterdale Terrier has a lot of energy to expend. While these dogs are not typically hyperactive, they do require a significant amount of daily exercise. The Patterdale Terrier is a working breed which means that you must exercise both his body and his mind in order to keep him sharp \u2013 give him at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day and try to include him in your daily life. Playing games or giving him a job to do will help keep him from getting bored. Remember, a bored dog is a destructive dog, so don\u2019t take your chances! If you don\u2019t help your pooch work off all of their excess energy every day, they will find other ways to burn off that energy that you won\u2019t appreciate. The Patterdale Terrier is a working breed, so his focus will always be on doing the job he is assigned to do. The Patterdale Terrier is recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) and belongs to the Terrier Group. This breed remains unrecognized, however, by the American Kennel Club. Patterdale Terriers exhibit two different coat types: smooth or broken. Both types have a short and dense undercoat which requires very little grooming, though regular brushing will help to control shedding. In the smooth coated variety, the outer coat of hair is coarse and stiff \u2013 when lifted, it falls back into place. In the broken coat, the coat is intermediate with longer guard hairs than the smooth coat variety. Broken-coated Patterdale Terriers sometimes have face furnishings that form a sort of beard, eyebrows and mustache. The acceptable colors for this breed include black, liver, red, black-and-tan and bronze. Color may be solid or with white markings on the chest and feet. While Patterdale Terriers are very energetic and active, this is even more applicable to puppies \u2013 you have to keep a close watch on a Patterdale Terrier puppy to keep him out of trouble. Because this breed has a very high prey drive, it is also essential that you provide plenty of socialization as early in the puppy\u2019s life as possible (do not let those early impressionable puppy days go to waste!). Patterdale Terriers can be trained, but they do have a tendency to be a little headstrong so the earlier you start training a puppy, the better. They are also quite fragile as puppies and need to be treated with a gentle touch, so make sure to monitor them around young children so that no accidental rough play occurs.", "facts": " Not Applicable houses with yards, farms/rural areas, active singles, experienced dog owners Independent, confident, strong-willed, loving", "tags": "agility training, experienced dog owners, flyball, foxes, high-energy, Hunting Dogs, Patterdale Terrier, small dog syndrome, "}, "pekingese": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/pekingese/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pekingese.jpg", "name": "Pekingese", "type": "dog", "text": "When you are asked the oldest breed of dog around, what do you think of? You might think of the more simply-named dogs \u2013 the Pug would be an excellent guess. You might think about dogs that go back to the days of shepherding (German Shepherd, anyone?) or retrieving (Retrievers). But you\u2019d be pretty far off-base with many of those European-centralized guesses. That\u2019s right: the Pekingese is one of the oldest dog breeds known to man, having originated in ancient China. Like the also-ancient Pug, the Pekingese is a toy dog that was bred to be good company and comfortable on your lap. But these days, the Pekingese has an even richer history placed firmly on its foundation of strong pedigree. As a toy dog, the Pekingese bears many similarities to a number of small breeds such as the Japanese Chin or the Pug, but when it comes to its modern-day classification, it\u2019s apparent that this dog is a breed all its own. But if you\u2019re wondering whether or not it will make a good pet for you and your family\u2026 that remains to be seen. Keep reading: The Pekingese is a toy dog that was bred to be good company and comfortable on your lap. As stated already, one of the defining characteristics of the Pekingese breed might not be its unique physical characteristics \u2013 it might be its own history! The breed doesn\u2019t look it, but it\u2019s one of the most foundational breeds that students of dog history are aware of. Naturally, the Pekingese get their name from a reference to what is now Beijing, as well as the Forbidden City. The Pekingese dogs were a favorite of Chinese imperial nobility, which explains its current stature as a world-famous toy dog. Throughout history, the Pekingese has kept a remarkable amount of its original breeding. Originating in ancient China, the Pekingese saw a familiar story to other ancient toy dogs \u2013 it was developed and bred in order to be good company for royalty and wealthy members of society. Since it didn\u2019t serve any official functions other than to be a friend, it has virtually zero history relating to the kind of histories we expect from working breeds. In other words, these types of breeds often have personalities more akin to cats than the traditional dog personalities we\u2019re used to encountering. One of the remarkable notes about the Pekingese is that it has seen relatively little changes throughout its thousands of years. The breed has remained pure and true to its origins all of this time, and the only modern variations we see usually deal with the length of the coat rather than the purity of the breed itself. Consequently, it\u2019s hard to remark on the Pekingese\u2019s pedigree when it\u2019s one of the oldest dogs known that has seen little cross-breeding. A small dog, the Pekingese might try to goad you into giving it particularly rich or flavorful food \u2013 eggs, for example. But you can feed your dog a normal diet and avoid spoiling them simply by refusing to capitulate to its wishes. It\u2019s important to remember that the Pekingese is a small dog and requires a similarly small diet. The Pekingese dogs were a favorite of Chinese imperial nobility. Since Pekingese are ideal for companionship, they should be socialized and should get used to the idea of strangers from an early age. For this reason, they can typically make good city dogs \u2013 especially given their long and illustrious history in some of the ancient cities of China. Make sure to have a regular routine and standard of discipline for any dog. At around 7 to 14 pounds, the Pekingese is a light dog and similar to other small toy dogs. You won\u2019t find many dogs smaller than this one, so remember that it\u2019s important not to overfeed and under exercise your Pekingese \u2013 even if they gain only a pound, it can be a lot for this pooch. Similar to many other toy dogs, the Pekingese can have a rambunctious and friendly personality, although it can also tend toward independence, similar to cats. It\u2019s important to remember that this is still a dog and should be disciplined like one. As we remarked earlier, making sure he has been properly socialized and understands its role in the pecking order will be crucial if raising this dog from a young age. Like many toy dogs, heart failure is a fear with Pekingese dogs. You can watch for these kinds of symptoms by also watching for heart murmur. It will be important to take your dog to a local veterinarian on a fairly regular basis to make sure your dog is living a healthy lifestyle. Ten to 15 years is a normal life span for a toy dog of this size, although this assumes a typically healthy Pekingese dog. Toy dogs don\u2019t require a lot of exercise, but they do require regular exercise \u2013 as do you! Make sure you take your dog on a regular walk and you shouldn\u2019t have any problems with over or under-exercising. Pekingese can have a rambunctious and friendly personality, although it can also tend toward independence. The American Kennel Club recognizes the Pekingese\u2019s strong stature but notes that they\u2019re not a particularly \u201cdainty\u201d breed, as you might expect from a toy dog with this kind of physical appearance. A double coat can mean a good amount of maintenance. If a Pekingese is being shown, the type of coat you want to maintain for your dog should be considered. Pekingese puppies should be raised to understand their role as a good companion dog. Don\u2019t over-exercise puppies \u2013 let them grow naturally and exercise them with what they can handle.

Outgoing, playful, loving, and companionable dogs, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi makes a great family pet, as it plays wonderfully with children. Introduced to Wales in the ninth century, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi made its way to Pembrokeshire in the 12 century. It is believed that is said that Vikings and Flemish weavers brought the dogs with them when they decided to settle in Wales. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi was used for herding sheep, geese, ducks, horses and cattle, and is considered to be one of the oldest herding breed of dogs. Found to be excellent companions as well, this breed is a favorite of Queen Elizabeth II, who owned 16 Pembroke Welsh Corgis at one point. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi originated from the Swedish Valhund. It was cross bred with Schipperke, Pomeranian, and other Spitz-type dogs.

As with most dog breeds, you shouldn\u2019t use harsh or negative training methods on your Pembroke Welsh Corgi \u2013 it just won\u2019t work and you\u2019ll end up frustrated. Another thing to keep in mind is that Corgis don\u2019t respond to repetitive training because it gets bored easily. Part of the training should include not to bark at strangers \u2013 socialization and obedience training can help this problem. And although the Pembroke Welsh Corgi probably will not respond to commands from strangers, it will respond commands from all family members. Once properly trained, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi makes good obedience and show dogs once they have been properly trained.

You\u2019ll find that Pembroke Welsh Corgis have a happy personality, are loyal to its masters, and quite tough. It plays well with children, as long as it\u2019s not pestered and can even handle some rough play. Because this breed was made to herd livestock, it can be a little domineering at times, but proper training can take care of this problem. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are good problems solvers, but your dog may also have a stubborn and independent streak. Corgis are natural watchdogs and will bark at strangers and distrust people they do not know. If you want to correct this, start training and socializing is important.

To wear your dog out, kids make excellent playmates \u2013 get them to play tug of war, hide and seek, and chase games. For outdoor activities to do with your Pembroke Welsh Corgi, go for a walk, jog or hike, or take your pooch to the dog park to play with other dogs. You\u2019ll find that Pembroke Welsh Corgis have a happy personality, are loyal to its masters, and quite tough. The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cLow-set, strong and sturdily built, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi gives an impression of substance in a small space. He is one of the most agreeable small house dogs, as well as an avid competitor in many dog sports, including conformation, herding and obedience.\u201d Sporting a thick coat of medium length hair, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi\u2019s outer coat of its double coat is coarse, while the inner coat is fine and thick. Oils from its skin make its fur water resistant. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi\u2019s coat can be black, tan, sable, red, or fawn. Some have coats with white markings. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi medium length coat is easy to maintain. Shedding seasons take place in the spring and summer, so weekly brushing with a wire brush will help.

Many people believe that the Pitbull is a wonderful family companion while others believe that this hybrid needs to be banned from their communities. The truth is that most Pitbulls, like all other dog breeds, are absolutely reliable pets that are great with kids and love people. Most of their bad reputation can be attributed to bad owners and irresponsible tabloid journalists. It\u2019s certainly not the fault of any Pitbulls out there, who are absolutely wonderful pets as long as they are bred and trained responsibly.  Those who want to have a Pitbull as a member of their families must do their research. Buying a Pitbull on the corner or through the local classifieds ads is a risky situation. It is essential that the buyer talk to the breeder extensively about his experiences and hopes for this hybrid breed. They should ask about health clearances as well as meet both of the parents and any other relatives on the premises. Because of the bad breeders of \u201cPitbulls\u201d, it is important that the potential buyer be knows everything about the breed before bringing a Pitbull into his household. Is a Pitbull the right dog to bring into your home? Possibly, but there are many factors to consider. Fortunately, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Keep your eyeballs glued to this page and scroll away  to find out if these dogs are the right choice for you! Pitbulls are reliable pets that are great with kids and love people. Nobody really knows the exact origin of the Pitbull began. According to most sources, it seems that this dog breed was a result of breeding bulldogs with terriers to create a new hybrid. The goal of the breeders was to produce a dog that would feature the strength of the bully breeds complemented by the perseverance and agility of the terrier. The reason why these particular traits were desirable was that the new hybrid was supposed to excel in bull baiting and bear baiting, two gruesome \u201csports\u201d that were particularly popular in the 16th century. By the 18th and 19th centuries, a distinct breed of dog was popular in England \u2013 the bull-and-terrier. Sadly, the breed was mostly \u2013 if not exclusively \u2013 used for rat baiting and dog fighting. It is now commonly believed that the bull-and-terrier was the breed of origin for the Pitbull, which later evolved from mixing in the United States.  These origins are sad and unfortunate, but they do explain where the Pitbull\u2019s bad reputation comes from. These dogs shouldn\u2019t be judged by the sad things that humans have trained them to do. They are so much more than that. While these two aggressive main traits certainly can be seen in Pitbulls today, it doesn\u2019t mean that these dogs are inherently violent. The strength and the tenacity can be wonderful traits if directed towards a productive activity, rather than exploited for violence. This is yet another reason why Pitbulls deserve revaluation from dog lovers everywhere. Luckily, time showed its prettier side, and the practice of dog fighting and similar bloodsports were banned in most places around the world. With that, pitbulls got a long-deserved chance to show their true face and a kinder, protective side \u2013 one that we can see and enjoy today. It would be wonderful if we could report that the Pitbull was developed as a result of breeding breed X to breed Y. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The only information about the breed origin is the two types of dogs that were used to develop it, the bulldog and the terrier, but no specific breeds. We know that the Cockapoo was developed by breeding a Cocker Spaniel to a Poodle but with Pitbulls, the mixes are unclear. There simply wasn\u2019t much documentation kept by the breeders who created the Pitbull and given the unfortunate reason why this breed was created, that\u2019s probably for the best. In fact, the very term Pitbull doesn\u2019t signify a singular breed. Rather, it\u2019s a term used to describe a whole type of breeds that share similar traits and characteristics. Bull Terrier, the Miniature Bull Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier can all be called Pitbull dogs. For that reason, there is no official recognition from the American Kennel Club for the name Pitbull. Even so, there are certain features that these dogs show, and they can be a part of an ideal Pitbull look. Of course, one of the first things to notice is the lean build and a powerful, athletic frame. Pits have a great deal of energy and strength, and it always shows on their body. What is more, these dogs have an iconic \u201cpoised\u201d stance that signifies their athleticism and readiness, and it is surely one of the defining features of their powerful looks.  Because of his athleticism and size, the Pitbull will require a lot of food. However, it\u2019s not enough to focus simply on the quantity of the foods and opt for a cheap, off-brand kibble  (or even worse, table scraps). Failing to provide a well-balanced diet for your new pet can lead to a variety of health issues in the long run. Everything from obesity to diabetes can be linked back to poor dietary choices, so make sure to offer only the best to your Pitbull pet.  For these dogs, the best choice is a high-quality dry dog food specifically formulated for their needs. There are plenty of premium brands that cater to dogs of this type, but make sure to get kibble that suits your pet\u2019s age (puppy, adult, or senior), size (large) and activity level (active). This type of food will be nutritionally dense and you won\u2019t have to go through bags of kibble in a few days to make sure your pet is getting everything they need. In fact, make sure to stick to feeding guide- don\u2019t overdo it just because a Pitbull is a big dog. A healthy and balanced meat and veggies diet can also be great for Pitbulls. These strong and muscular dogs will require good quality, lean food to maintain their athletic build and good health. An occasional meal of tasty greens and lean red meat can bring a lot of benefits for your pet. Just make sure that the rations are balanced and measured, and that all important nutrients are included in a meal.  If you are in any way concerned about establishing or altering your Pitbull\u2019s diet, then it\u2019s always wise to consult with a veterinarian first. While pet food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, these are still guidelines and should never be treated as gospel. All dogs are different and each has their own specific needs. Only your vet is qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pup. So always seek out the advice of a veterinarian before making any radical changes to what goes into your pup\u2019s food dish and their belly. Pitbulls require assertive owners who are adamant of being the leaders in their households. Pitbulls require assertive owners who are adamant of being the leaders in their households. Laid back owners who can\u2019t be bothered to work with the dog in obedience training, should rethink their decisions to getting a Pitbull. Pitbulls want to be the dominant entity in the home and without a strong leader; the family and home will be in chaos and under the control of the dog. It\u2019s vital that any Pitbull owner establish themselves as the alpha early and often to avoid any potential problems. For this reason, the Pitbull is not recommended for first time dog owners. It takes an experience, patient, and special owner to train this dog properly. As a breed, the Pitbull can be a bit stubborn or willful when the owner starts slacking. A Pitbull owner that fails to set boundaries or help his pet by asserting necessary command, will soon find himself overloaded with work \u2013 and in that situation, things can get out of hand. Control is important when you have a Pitbull for a pet \u2013 and contrary to popular opinion, that control and dominance will not have a negative effect on a loving and friendly relationship between pet and owner.  All training should be done in a positive way. Harsh and physically abusive techniques will only cause the Pitbull to balk or protect himself. Indeed, dogs do have the same fight or flight instinct that humans have. Positive training techniques using praise and treats work best for Pitbulls. Balancing that treatment with the firm hand necessary to remain the alpha is quite tricky. It takes a special type of person to train a Pitbull right, but they will have a perfect companion for life. There is a major dispute as to the proper weight for Pitbulls. The vast majority of breeders believe that Pitbulls should weigh between 35 and 60 pounds. As for their height, they should stand from 18 to 24 inches tall at the withers. However, it is crucial to remember here that weight is directly proportional to your pet\u2019s musculature and build. Pitbulls are naturally strong and lean, and the stronger among them can easily reach 60 pounds without having any extra fat. As long as you pay attention to their diet and offer plenty of exercise, you can ensure a good balance without having your pet become skinny or fat.  Every dog has their own quirks and traits, and each of them has a personality that can be considered unique. Pitbull dogs can vary from headstrong, willful dogs to sweet, gentle giants. There\u2019s no rule set in stone as to how these dogs behave, but one thing\u2019s for sure: socialization and training play the crucial role in their temperament. Of course, plenty about their character depends on the owner and how the dog is treated from an early age. When shown care and compassion, as well as some dominant guidance, a Pitbull can grow up into a caring and friendly protector.  If a Pitbull has been treated unkindly and been taught that aggression is a desirable trait, it will take a lot to rehabilitate them. However, if you take a Pitbull and start with positive reinforcement training and socialization early in their life, there\u2019s no reason why they would become violent or moody. In fact, a lot of these dogs are therapy or service dogs and can learn to become the sweetest companions to humans in need. It all comes down to environment, making it clear that the so called \u201cdangerous\u201d Pitbulls that earned such horrible reputations were the result of abusive homes.  As a blank canvas, Pitbulls defy the stigma that surrounds them. Not only that they\u2019re not naturally aggressive, but they\u2019re affectionate, smart, and quite goofy. Their lovable temperament really shines through when they have the right person by their side. And if they are a part of a loving family, pitbulls can easily become those caring gentle giants that will be there to protect and safeguard their family. After all, it\u2019s all about what you offer to them. In a doggo\u2019s world \u2013 love is returned with love. Because the Pitbull has a high tolerance for pain, he can be ill or hurt and the owner will never know about it, until it is too late. There are a number of issues within this hybrid breed. These include hip and elbow dysplasia, subaortic stenosis, cranial crutiate ligament rupture, cataracts,  hypothyroidism, cutaneous histocytoma, allergies, Von Willebrand\u2019s Disease and various cancers. It\u2019s important to maintain regular checkups with a vet (especially as a Pitbull ages into their senior years) so that that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. The average Pitbull lives to be between 10 and 12 years old. Pitbulls are bundles of energy. They need loads of exercise to keep them healthy and happy. This hybrid dog will gladly go hiking in the mountains, running through the neighborhood, or tearing through the yard chasing varmints. He is active and must have loads of exercise. This requires active owners who are able to keep up with their Pitbulls. Without the proper exercise routine, these pups will be filled with unburned energy that can be focused in unfortunate areas. Not the best option for apartment dwellers, as Pitbulls need to have a place to burn off their energy. Without proper exercise and timely obedience training, the Pitbull can become destructive. Owners can come home from work to find furniture torn apart, holes chewed in walls and doors demolished. These are strong dogs and can really cause thousands of dollars in damage without proper exercise and stimulation. So consider exercising your Pitbull to be a vital responsibility and take it seriously. Of course, while it\u2019s undeniable that these dogs need a lot of physical activity to stay happy and healthy, you shouldn\u2019t neglect their need for mental stimulation. Pitbulls are smart and will need to challenge their bright mind to stay occupied when alone. Puzzle toys are a great way to this- try Kong or similar treat-filled toys that will give your pooch a few hours of tasty fun. Pitbulls are bundles of energy. The American Kennel Club does not recognize the Pitbull as a breed. The registries that do recognize them are the American Pitbull Registry, Sporting Dog Registry, American Bully Registry, Worldwide Dog Registry, American Dog Breeders Association, American National Dog Registry and the Worldwide Dog Registry. Pitbulls should have a shiny and glossy coat that lies flat against the body. The coat should be single and smooth, never fluffy or tufted. All colors are possible but most reputable breeders frown upon merles. Blue eyes are also unacceptable to those breeders who truly want to develop a stable and healthy breed. Pitbull puppies are cute, but need training right from the start. Don\u2019t give into their adorable puppy eyes and let those early and impressionable days go to waste. Proper training is vital to a Pitbull\u2019s success in life and should  It\u2019s best to crate train this hybrid as he will chew on anything he can sink his teeth into. A puppy can chew the leg off of a table or chair, so Pitbull puppies need constant supervision. Keep your eyes on them at all times or you will regret it. Early socialization with people and other animals is essential for this hybrid. The puppy should also begin Puppy Kindergarten classes immediately after vaccinations. If you want to make sure that having a Pitbull as a pet doesn\u2019t lead to any problems, assert yourself as a pack leader early on.

Being an athlete, he needs tons of exercise. Whether he is hunting in the mountains or jogging in the suburbs, the Plott loves to be outside interacting with his owner. He is a high-energy dog and needs an active family to keep him happy. This breed is quite social and accepts friendly guests readily. Although he is protective, the Plott senses if his family is in danger and if not, the guest is usually welcomed with a wagging tail. Any threat to the Plott\u2019s family will result in melee. This breed loves his family and will do all that he can to protect them. To learn more about the Plott, read on. The Plott is a brave and courageous hunter as well as a devoted and loyal family companion. Originating from the mountains of North Carolina in the United States, the Plott gained his name from the man who developed them, Johannes Plott. These dogs were bred to take out wild boar as well as track and tree bears. Today, the Plott still hunts and can primarily be found in rural and mountainous areas hunting with and protecting their families. The Plott is a descendant of the five Hanoverian Hounds brought to the U.S. from Germany by Johannes Plott in 1750. Plott was rather secretive about developing his breed. Johannes\u2019 children and grandchildren continued to develop the breed after his death. Plotts were distributed in the Smokey Mountains and proved themselves to be incredible hunting dogs. In the 1900s, a gentleman by the name of Bevins bred some of his Plotts to Black and Tan Hounds. This created dogs with incredible scenting abilities as well as introduced the brindle and black saddle markings to the breed. From this cross, Boss and Tige resulted. These are the main dogs behind the breed we now know as the Plott. All hunting dogs require a high-quality food specifically created for their activity levels. Considering the Plott is an avid hunter, he needs specialized food. It is best to feed dry kibble as this can cut down on veterinary bills associated with tooth decay and gum disease.  It is essential that the Plott\u2019s meals be separated into two smaller meals as opposed to one large meal. Exercise should be prohibited after meals. This breed is predisposed to gastric torsion, also known as bloat. This life threatening condition can be prevented with smaller meals and limited exercise after eating. Because of his keen intelligence and eagerness to please his family, the Plott is a wonderful student.

It is important that the owner ensure that the Plott understands his role in the pack as Plotts tend to try to become the dominant one in the pack. This can never be allowed. The dog must be taught his place from an early age. Treats and praise will work better than harsh words and manhandling with this breed. Those who plan to use their Plotts for hunting will be pleasantly surprised. It takes almost no training at all for this breed to hunt. They go on pure instinct and do rather well. Learning the dog\u2019s signals and voice will be better than all the training in the world to the owner. On the average, the Plott weighs between 40 and 75 pounds and stands between 20 and 27 inches tall at the withers. Plotts attach to their families quickly. They are protective of their people and make excellent watchdogs. Because they were bred to be hunting dogs and hunt in packs, the Plott can have some dominance issues. This can be a problem for passive owners or families with small children. Plotts love living with several dogs. This is representative of how they lived centuries ago. They form strong bonds with their canine companions however; there will be occasional squabbles. This is a normal part of pack life. It is merely a competition to see which dog is going to be Alpha within the pack. So long as the humans are seen as being higher up on the Totem Pole than the dogs, this bickering should not be a problem. A vocal breed, the Plott can drive his family and the neighbors crazy with his barking. This noise can lead to trouble within the neighborhood as well as problems with the Division of Animal Control. The Plott must be taught to quiet on command at an early age or he can be problematic to have in your household. The Plott is an incredibly healthy dog. Gastric torsion is the main issue within the breed that can be devastating. Plotts do tend to experience a high incidence of ear infections. This is due to the warmth inside of the ears because they are drooping. Weekly ear cleaning can help avoid infections. Generally, Plotts can live to be between 12-14 years of age. For centuries, Plotts were bred to hunt wild and vicious animals. They were and still are very active dogs. The Plott craves exercise and needs it to be healthy as well as a well-adjusted member of the family. This breed would make a great companion for the avid jogger or runner. Better yet, he would be thrilled to be your hunting buddy and sleep lightly beside you while camping, keeping his sensitive ears open for any dangers. Plotts also love to play fetch and with training, make great Frisbee partners. Without proper exercise, the Plott can become extremely disrupted and even aggressive. Exercise is essential to this breed. Plotts can excel in obedience and agility courses, with proper training. The activities involved with agility training will work all of their muscles and show off their athleticism as well. They make great companions for active families with older kids. Plotts attach to their families quickly. They are protective of their people and make excellent watchdogs. The American Kennel Club writes: \u201cPlotts are eager to please, loyal, intelligent and alert in the home, but are aggressive, bold and fearless while hunting. Owners should be prepared to hear the Plott\u2019s \u201cvoice\u201d in the home at times. An athletic breed, they require daily exercise, but their short coats are low maintenance.\u201d The Plott was recognized by the AKC in 2006.  The Plott\u2019s coat is rather coarse and short in length. It is double coated considering the breed has been bred for hunting and needs protection from the elements and briars and brambles. The Plott sheds minimally. Brindle is the preferred coloration of the Plott however; other colors are acceptable. Black, brindle with a black saddle marking and black with brindle markings are permissible. A minimal amount of white on the feet and chest is considered to be acceptable by the AKC however; white is not the desired color. All puppies are adorable and this is true of the Plott puppy too. Because Plotts were bred to hunt in packs, it is very important that they start obedience training as soon as possible. This will help the owner to establish his Alpha role in the family and let the dog know that he is not and will never be, the top dog in the household.

The Pocket Pitbull might sound like an exotic breed that just got its start, but there have probably been many Patterdale Terrier and Pitbull mixes throughout history. The only difference is that those crosses weren\u2019t intentional- but rather a product of accidental mating between the two purebreds. No breeder claims that he or she were the ones to first breed the Pocket Pitbull, so there is no clear data about the breed\u2019s origin. The best guess anyone can have is that these crossbreeds had a start similar to many other designer dogs- they were bred in the last 20 years somewhere in the United States. Pocket Pitbull is not a purebred dog. It is a hybrid of the American Pitbull Terrier and the Patterdale Terrier. Owing to the difference in size, the mom is always the Pitbull, and the dad is the smaller Patterdale Terrier. The Pocket Pitbull is a 50/50 cross of these two breeds, though it is possible to have a greater percentage of one breed if a first-generation breed is bred to either an American Pitbull Terrier or a Patterdale Terrier.

Though there is some evidence to suggest that the breed has existed for more than seven thousand years, it only appeared in the Canary Islands 500 years ago. Early ancestors of the Podenco Canario lived in the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula and are thought to have been imported to the Canary Islands by Mediterranean merchants.

The PON is a medium sized dog and has a square shaped and well-muscled body. Its body is covered in a wavy overcoat and a soft undercoat. The coat can come in a wide array of colors but white, brown and grey are the most common, and often appear with black, grey or brown markings.

The Polski Owczarek Nizinny or Polish Lowland Sheepdog is the shaggy herder of Poland. The history of the PON in Poland dates back to the early thirteenth century. It is believed that the breed originated primarily from the coated working dogs that arrived in Europe from Central Asia. In 1514, a Polish merchant is said to have traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland and brought six PONs to help herd his livestock. The story goes that a certain Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the dog\u2019s temperament and herding abilities that he traded a ram and two ewes for three PONS. These dogs were then bred with local breeds to produce Scottish herding dogs like the Bearded Collie. The breed was almost driven to extinction in the aftermath of World War II, but was revived mainly thanks to the efforts of the Polish breeder Dr. Danuta Hryniewicz and her PON Smok. Smok was considered by Dr. Hryniewicz as the epitome of the breed in terms of physique and temperament and sired the first ten litters of PONS. He is often revered as the father of the modern Polish Lowland Sheepdog. It is believed that the PON\u2019s pedigree consists of bloodlines from various Central Asian herding dogs like the Tibetan Terrier and Lhasa Apso.

However, if this dog senses that its owner is not in control of its \u201cpack\u201d it can often try to assume leadership which can in turn result in various behavioral issues. Therefore it is important that PON owners establish early on that they are the leader of the pack and remain consistent in their leadership. Bred to be herding dogs, PONs have strong protective instincts and can be extremely vary of strangers. They will often alert its owners to the presence of strangers with loud barking. They are also a brave breed and will not back down when challenged. These qualities make the PON an excellent guard dog. The PONs herding instincts can sometimes become a problem if not kept in check as they sometimes develop tendencies to nip at their owners\u2019 feet.

Read on to find out more about the Pomeranian. The Pomeranian is a wonderful addition to the family, thanks to its docile temperament, intelligence and devotion. The history of this attractive dog breed can be traced back to the Prussian region of Pomerania, where the Pomeranian breed gradually emerged from the ancient Spitz dogs that were originally used as sled dogs. The breed\u2019s name originally came from the historical region of Pomerania (now present day Germany and Poland). Originally weighing nearly 30 pounds, the dog served as an able herder of sheep in its larger form. However, where the original Spitz was a true dog with a role, the much smaller Pomeranian really isn\u2019t. These were bred to be small and thus cuter, and were basically bred as  lap and show dogs. These dogs, which weighed in at a hefty four to five pounds, became an instant hit among the nobility of the day. Its natural skills at showmanship not only made them popular dogs for showing in competitions, but also popular in the circus for its outgoing and winning personalities as well as their agility and ability to learn fairly complicated tricks. Having an exotic pupper to proudly display in their arms was a hit with the nobles of the day \u2013 and easily displayed their wealth and aristocratic position. The Pomeranian spread all over Europe from that moment on.  There have been some rather famous owners of Pomeranians throughout history. Among them are Marie Antoinette, Mozart, Thomas Edison, and Michelangelo in addition to Queen Victoria who owned quite a few of these amazing little dogs. Queen Victoria\u2019s pet was particularly small and tiny, and served as a staple for all other Pomeranian\u2019s that followed. A true trend-setter, the Queen can be credited for launching the stellar \u201ccareer\u201d of this breed and increasing its popularity.  Pedigree Tracing back to the ancient Spitz dogs Tracing back to the ancient Spitz dogs that were used to pull sleds, the Pomeranian is a much smaller dog than its ancestors. Its small size is a result of Queen Victoria, who during the 1800s requested a smaller breed that became the dog we know today. When established looks are considered, the Pomeranians need to follow a few staple characteristics. With a height between 8 and 14 inches (20 to 36 cm), these puppers stand straight and perky. Their symmetrical and shaggy coat is their iconic feature of course, and is accentuated with a top coat ruff that rings their neck. It comes in many different colors, with red, black, brown, and white, being the most popular ones.  The Pomeranian was recognized by the AKC in 1888. That is the same year when Queen Victoria adopted her dear Pomeranian. In the following decades, the rise of this breed was always impressive, and Pomeranian became a balanced, rounded, and well-developed dog breed.  Pomeranians are known to be picky eaters, and since this breed needs to be fed dry dog food in order to prevent tooth loss, feeding them can be a problem. Try to stay away from table scraps \u2013 your Pomeranian will develop a taste for it and may ignore its dry food altogether. A balanced source of nutrients needs to be provided, even if it takes some trial and error before you discover your Pom\u2019s favorite brand of kibble. An occasional meal of light meat and veggies can be helpful to, in order to maintain a healthy immune system. Of course, your vet can provide you with the best possible information in regards to the diet, and can recommend something especially for your Pomeranian. When in doubt, ask the vet.   A favorite among those who show dogs, Pomeranians\u2019 easygoing personalities make them a great forever companion as well. Pomeranians can be a handful at times \u2013 although they are intelligent, they can also be willful. Also, they can sometimes be a true spark around the house: when that extra energy kicks in, they can be all over the place, running and goofing off. To get things under control, it is good to start training them as soon as possible and to be consistent with it. Since the breed is smart, your dog can be taught some amazing tricks. Like most dogs, crate training your Pomeranian is important, as it needs a den of its own. An immense help during this process can be positive reinforcement and a dominant, strict attitude.  Both male and female Pomeranians can weigh anywhere from three to seven pounds. While this really isn\u2019t much, it is directly in proportion with the breeds looks and height. And it also contributes to their high energy! And what\u2019s best \u2013 they really feel light as a feather when you carry them around in your arms! As we mentioned before, the Pomeranian is outgoing and intelligent. They will soak up all the attention they can get from your family. And because they are so small, they travel well, so your Pomeranian can make friends wherever it travels. Because of its small size, which makes it more prone to injury, the Pomeranian is best suited for homes with older children. In addition, smaller children may get your Pomeranian overly excited. Households with older children are ideal, as Pomeranians will be more likely to be showered with the attention they desire. It\u2019s also a good idea to get your kids involved with training \u2013 it\u2019s a wonderful way to set boundaries and build strong bonds. It may be a bit of a dog stereotype, but the small Pomeranians can be a bit yippy. But if you start training young, you can nip the yip in the bud! The Pomeranian suffers from small dog syndrome, which means it doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a small dog. That\u2019s why it will pick a fight with a much bigger dog. And because the Pomeranian loves attention, ensure that it\u2019s not left alone for long periods of time. As long as your Pomeranian gets the exercise it needs and lots of love, it will make an excellent pet. You should be aware of a few health conditions that are fairly common with Pomeranians. One of the most frequent is early tooth loss. You can help prevent this by feeding your Pomeranian a healthy diet of dry dog food that helps condition its teeth and gums. You can also brush your Pomeranian\u2019s teeth daily.  Always check with the breeder in order to identify any potential problems in the parental lines of a Pomeranian and make sure your dog gets regular check-ups so issues can be identified early on. Pomeranians have a life expectancy of 12 to 16 years. Easy to bond with and friendly, they are ideal as a companion pet. The Pomeranian needs regular exercise though it is possible for them to get a fair amount by simply running around the house. We recommend taking them for a daily walk \u2013 besides, the Pomeranian will love the attention it gets along the way. Because it is so small, this breed travels well, so your Pomeranian can make friends wherever it travels. The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cThe Pomeranian is a cocky, animated companion with an extroverted personality. This compact little dog is an active toy breed with an alert character and fox-like expression.\u201d Pomeranians have a soft and fluffy undercoat and a long and straight overcoat. The Pomeranian\u2019s coat comes in a variety of colors, so don\u2019t be surprised to see a range of varieties. The Pomeranian\u2019s coat sheds constantly and it needs daily brushing in order to prevent tangling and matting. This grooming habit will help prevent dandruff as well. You should also clean its ears and eyes prevent potential problems and infections. Your adorable Pomeranian puppy will need lots of attention and love, so do it right from the start. The first four to six months are important when it comes to forming your dog\u2019s personality and responsiveness. Be consistent with house training and discipline, and stick to a routine \u2013 you\u2019ll be rewarded with years of ease and pleasure.", "facts": " AKC Toy Families with older children, singles, seniors, apartments, houses with/without yards Bold, curious, playful, adventurous", "tags": "apartments, condo, lap dog, picky eaters, Pomeranian, royalty, Spitz, tooth loss, toy breed, willful, yippy, "}, "pont-audemer spaniel": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/pont-audemer-spaniel/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/pont-audemer-spaniel.jpg", "name": "Pont-Audemer Spaniel", "type": "dog", "text": "Though he may not do well as a family pet (especially for inexperienced dog owners), the Pont-Audemer Spaniel is an excellent hunting breed. With multiple spaniel breeds in his genetics, the breed excels in the field as a water spaniel. In addition to his strong hunting skills, the Pont-Audemer Spaniel is also known for growing a long topknot of curly hair on top of his head that, combined with the curly hair on his ears, makes him look like he\u2019s wearing a long, curly wig. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is an excellent hunting breed. The exact origins of the Pont-Audemer Spaniel are unknown but it is thought to have been developed during the nineteenth century in the Pont-Audemer region of France. It is commonly thought that it was bred from the English Water Spaniel and the Irish Water Spaniel, though they were more commonly used as setters than for doing spaniel-type work in the field. In the early years, breed numbers were high but by the end of World War II, numbers had sharply declined. As a result, the president of the Pont-Audemer breed club allowed for other breeds to be crossed with the existing gene pool to prevent inbreeding. Numbers remained low until, in 1980, the breed club was merged with the Picardy Spaniel breed club and is now recognized by the FCI as the Pont-Audemer Spaniel. The exact origins of the Pont-Audemer Spaniel are unknown, but it is likely the result of a cross between the English Water Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniel. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is a medium- to large-sized breed, weighing up to 60 pounds at maturity. This being the case, he should be fed a high-quality dry food formulated for adult dogs. If you plan to use the dog for hunting, a higher-calorie working breed formula might be a good choice. Otherwise, you might want to consider a large-breed dog food to provide your dog with the protein he needs to maintain lean muscle mass without so much fat that he gains an unhealthy amount of weight. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is an intelligent breed that generally responds well to training. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is an intelligent breed that generally responds well to training. As a dog of the spaniel type, these dogs are eager to learn and they are also adaptable. This breed loves to have fun and they can be clownish at times, so as long as you keep your training sessions short and enjoyable, it should go well. This breed is primarily kept as a working gun dog, so think twice before choosing this breed as a family pet. They are smart and easy to train, but it is a lifelong commitment to make and you\u2019ll need to start early with training and socialization. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel walks the line between a medium and large-sized bred that stands 20 to 23 inches tall and weighs 44 to 60 pounds at maturity. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is a hardy and hard-working breed which makes him an excellent working dog. These dogs are intelligent and easy to train while also being gentle and affectionate with family. They are also known for their fun-loving and clownish personalities which make them a joy to keep. In fact, they are sometimes called \u201cle petit clown des marais\u201d, or the little clown of the marshes. Because these dogs are rarely kept as family pets, however, little is known about their temperament in the home. Because of their high energy and difficult training, however, they are generally not recommended as family pets. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is still a fairly uncommon breed, so there is not a great deal of information available about their health status. Generally considered to be a healthy breed, the Pont-Audemer Spaniel is still prone to certain health problems. Due to their long, floppy ears, the breed may have a higher risk for ear infections and they are also prone to alopecia (or hair loss). The breed may also be prone to injury in the field. The average lifespan for the Pont-Audemer Spaniel is thought to be about 12 to 14 years which is about average for a breed of its size.

The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is not currently recognized by the AKC but he is recognized by the FCI and the UKC. The FCI classifies him in Group 7 as a Spaniel type for the Continental Pointing Dogs and the UKC as a Gun Dog. The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is unique in appearance because he has a curly or wave coat with a long topknot of curly hair on the head. The coat on the body is medium length and curly or wavy, though it is shorter and smoother on the face. Common coat colors include brown and white roan, though solid brown coats are acceptable as well. Any black or tan markings are considered a fault and most dogs have docked tails. The average litter size for the Pont-Audemer Spaniel is 4 to 8 puppies. Because these dogs grow to an adult size over 50 pounds, in many cases, they are best fed a large-breed puppy formula to prevent them from growing too quickly. Once they reach about 80% of their adult expected size, you can switch to a large-breed adult recipe.

Many of us immediately imagine the Toy Poodle. However, that is only one of the many types of Poodle out there. Sure, the Toy Poodle is iconic, but as a breed, the Poodle has a surprising amount of variety and versatility. Poodles can be athletic, rambunctious, energetic \u2013 just about anything under the sun. At least relative to the expectations of Poodles that many people bring to the table. People are far too willing to put the Poodle in a box of limited expectations. The Poodle deserve more respect than that. They are such a rich and exciting dog breed filled with possibilities. Hopefully over time, The Poodle will finally get the respect that they deserve as one of the most exciting, versatile, and intelligent dog breeds around.\n\nThe Poodle is an extremely smart dog, ranking second only below the Border Collie as the most intelligent dog breed. They are highly-trainable and make excellent service and therapy dogs. As family pets and companions, these popular dogs are loving, playful and even a bit mischievous. You\u2019ll never be bored with a Poodle by your side. In fact, you\u2019ll have to keep an eye on your Poodle companion to make sure that they don\u2019t use those big and powerful brains to get up to trouble.  While a lot of people might think of Poodles as the epitome of a lapdog with an elaborate hairstyle, these dogs come in all sizes- from toy to standard Poodles that weigh up to 70 pounds. If you want to find out which type of Poodle is the right one for you- or if the breed is a good match for your family in the first place- read on. As you may have gathered by now, there are so many different types of Poodles out there that almost impossible that that there won\u2019t be one that can fit into your lifestyle.  As a breed, this dog has a surprising amount of variety and versatility. The Poodle might seem like a posh show dog, but these dogs actually started out as working dogs (generally as water retrievers, or \u201cgun dogs\u201d). Their original role was to assist hunters in retrieving waterfowl (such as ducks) from the water. Their curly coat, which is now primped up for dog shows, was valued for its moisture-resistant qualities. The German word \u201cpudel,\u201d in fact, actually refers to all the splashing these pips would get up to during any hunt. The English word \u201cPoodle\u201d was derived from it. Even though the breed originated in 19th century Germany, the standard was perfected in France, which considers Poodle to be a national dog breed. These dogs are now known primarily as show dogs and pets. Selective breeding had a great deal to do with this change in perception. There are three varieties of Poodle, and according to the American Kennel Club, the oldest of these varieties is the large or \u2018Standard\u2019 variety. The Poodle was bred to have a water-resistant coat \u2013 which helps explain the quality of the current dog\u2019s coat \u2013 that was eventually groomed and patterned according to taste and style rather than worrying simply about functionality. Other types of Poodle today include Toy and Miniature. Although they retain the main traits of their full-sized relatives, their compact size makes them a perfect fit for condo and apartment dwellers. They are generally quite well behaved pooches who can get on well within a small space and can be left alone for extended periods of time without causing too much trouble.  Other types of Poodle today include Toy and Miniature. Since there are three varieties of Poodle, two of those varieties \u2013 the Toy and Miniature \u2013 actually take its pedigree from the oldest of these varieties, the large or Standard Poodle. If you plan on showing your dog, a quality pedigree will be an absolute must. Otherwise, a health guarantee is all you need from a reputable Poodle breeder. It\u2019s important to always request proper papers or guarantees from any breeder. If a breeder is not willing to offer this sort of documentation, then they should not be trusted or patronized. Sadly there are many disreputable breeders indulging in unsafe practices out there. They should be avoided and discouraged; Poodles have been around for centuries and have ancestors across countries in Europe like Germany, England, and Spain. The Poodle does not widely differ from other dogs when it comes to their nutritional needs. Like most other dogs, these posh pooches will also thrive on a diet based on high-quality dry food for dogs. Of course, not all types of kibble will do. You\u2019ll have to pick out those that are suitable for your Poodle\u2019s age (puppy, adult, senior), size and activity levels. Kibble appropriate for toy breeds, small breeds, or large breeds will usually be a good fit. If you are in any way concerned about either establishing or altering your Poodle\u2019s diet, then it is always wise to consult with a veterinarian first. All dogs are different, each with their own needs. While pet food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still simply guidelines and might not necessarily apply to you dog. The only person qualified to determine the specific nutritional needs of your personal pooch is a vet. So always rely on their expertise before making any changes to what you pour into your pup\u2019s food dish. When it comes to exceptionally smart dogs, this breed ranks at the very top of the list. The impressive smarts are not reserved for only one type of Poodle either. All of them are considered to be second only to Border Collie in terms of intelligence. If you have the right training approach, this dog is going to be highly trainable. They won\u2019t have a problem learning commands or even elaborate tricks and routines- as long as they have the proper motivation. It\u2019s important to focus on positive reinforcement and rewards based training. Anything less is closer to abuse and will never get the results you desire. It will only harm the dog and your relationship.  Toy and Miniature Poodles might be prone to small dog syndrome and have a stubborn streak, so combine positive reinforcement training with a confident, firm attitude for best results. You must establish yourself as the alpha the relationship with a firm, yet gentle approach. Otherwise, your poodle will develop dreaded small dog syndrome and nobody wants that. It will lead to your Poodle becoming a tiny terror instead of a loving companion.  The Poodle\u2019s temperament is often about energy. Weight for Poodles will vary depending on the type. Toy can weigh as little as 6 pounds, Miniature version is usually at 15 pounds, while the Standard size can get up to around 40 to 70 pounds.  The Poodle\u2019s temperament is often about energy. From the Standard to the Miniature, you can expect your dog to be playful and lively- contrary to the popular image of a perfectly groomed lazy lap dog. They are also very sweet and affectionate. Combine that with their human-like intelligence and you have a dog that forms an inseparable bond to his family. Your Poodle will feel more like a fury relative than a family pet.  Curious, goofy, and smart, Poodle will love to play and can be a great companion to children. However, Toy and Miniature variants are also very fragile so they shouldn\u2019t be left alone with young children, as they could inadvertently hurt them. These are fragile animals who need to be handled with a gentle touch at all times.  Poodles can run into a few nasty health problems including Addison\u2019s Disease, thyroid issues, and cancer. Like almost all dogs, this breed can run into problems with the joints such as hip dysplasia. It\u2019s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a vet to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. A standard Poodle should have a life expectancy of around 12-15 years. The same approximate life expectancy goes for Miniature Poodles, which gives them plenty of time to grow up along with your children if you\u2019re considering getting this breed as a family pet. Being energetic as they are, this breed will meed a good deal of exercise. A lot of them will also enjoy living up to their hunting and pointing instincts. As former retrievers, Poodles should be able to enjoy chasing balls and Frisbees, as well. The American Kennel Club lists this dog as an \u201cactive\u201d breed. They will require at least 30 to 60 minutes daily exercise, depending on their size and overall activity level. If you are unable to meet these exercise requirements, your Poodle will run the risk of developing obesity or burning off all of their excess energy doing mischievous activities that your might not appreciate.  The Poodle, though often equated to the beauty with no brains, is exceptionally smart, active and excels in obedience training. The American Kennel Club\u2019s description of the Poodle reads as follows: \u201cThe Poodle, though often equated to the beauty with no brains, is exceptionally smart, active and excels in obedience training.\u201d The coat of the Poodle is, of course, one of its defining characteristics. Their curly, hypoallergenic hair comes in many different colors. There are the usual white, black, cream coats to blues, apricot, chocolate, and bi-colored poodles. Many people will groom their dog stylishly and in extravagant ways, especially for dog shows. If you\u2019re just taking in this dog as a pet, however, basic grooming is all they really need. Routine brushing to prevent matting and tangling to regular visits to a professional for a trim are all it takes to keep those curls perfect. Grooming your Poodle in an extravagant manner and creating cartoonish fluffy and puffy hairstyles is encouraged, but not required.  As this is an energetic breed, you can imagine how mischievous and active a puppy can be as it grows up. Make sure to get them through basic obedience and socialization early on. These dogs can be troublingly strong-willed if you let them.

They are multi-sensory hounds that hunt using both their sight and scent and come in three distinct sizes: The smallest Pequeno, the medium sized M\u00e9dio and the large Grande. These three sizes are generally not cross-bred and each has their own purpose. Podengos also comes in two coat variants \u2013 wiry haired and soft haired. The smallest of the three Podengos, the Pequeno has a distinctive wedge-shaped head, pointy erect ears and expressive almond-shaped head. The dog\u2019s back is fairly elongated and muscular. The tail tapers off into a point and is curved like sickle. Pequenos, like all Podengos, are hardy, active and extremely intelligent. As it\u2019s a highly intelligent breed with an agreeable personality, they are often easy to train. They are also extremely faithful to their owners and make excellent companions. The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is an ancient, no-nonsense hunting hound from Portugal. The Portuguese Podengo is an ancient breed that is believed to have derived from the hounds brought into the Iberian Peninsula by Phoenician traders from Asia Minor. The Pequeno was bred specifically to flush out and hunt small game such as rabbits in the harsh terrains of Portugal. The tiny Pequenos are also said to have accompanied Portuguese explorers on their ships as ratters. The first Podengo Pequenos arrived in America during the late 1990s. The Podengo is thought to be bred from several hounds in order to catch rats on ships. Pequenos have extremely high energy levels and should be fed 2 to 3 high-quality meals a day. Podengo Pequenos are extremely intelligent and lively. Podengo Pequenos are extremely intelligent and lively. They are however significantly less \u201crefined\u201d in their behaviors than other modern breeds and require an owner that is familiar with a more primal style of training. This includes setting rules, boundaries and limitations early on and making it clear what you expect from the dog. Pequenos can also be extremely willful at times and considering their small size and agility, it is advisable to keep them on a leash during training. Podengo Pequeno males weigh in at around 9 to 13 pounds. Podengo Pequeno Pequenos are lively and companionable and make excellent pets for the right dog owner. The ideal Podengo Pequeno owner should be able to display a calm and assertive style of leadership consistently. When placed in the hands of a weak leader, Pequenos can often become stubborn and willful and develop undesirable behaviors. Pequenos are also extremely brave for their size and are alert for any intrusions into their territory. This makes them a good choice as a guard dog for a small home or apartment. Pequenos also get along well with children and other animals, provided that they are socialized early. Setting rules and boundaries in terms of what constitutes as \u201cprey\u201d is extremely important when it comes to this breed as they have extremely strong hunting instincts. When walking them it is also advisable to do so on a leash as their attention can be easily captured by small animals that activate their hunting and chasing instincts. The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is a breed that has had little to no human intervention over the years and as a result does not suffer from any known hereditary health conditions. When well cared for, a Podengo Pequeno can enjoy a lifespan of up to 15 years. Podengo Pequenos were bred to have enough stamina and endurance to hunt throughout the day, for consecutive days. As such, they have seemingly limitless amounts of energy and require a great deal of exercise. Although their small size makes them suitable for small homes or apartments, they should only be housed in small living quarters if their owners are able to cater to their exercise needs each day. They often do best in houses with large gardens or rural farm yards where they can frolic about at will. Podengo Pequeno Pequenos are lively and companionable and make excellent pets for the right dog owner. The Podengo Pequeno Pequeno was first recognized by the American Kennel Club in January, 2013. The club has this to say about the breed: \u201cThe Portuguese Podengo Pequeno, a primitive breed, is known for its small size, erect ears, wedge shaped head, and two coat types, smooth and wire. It hunts by sight, scent and hearing, and is related to the Pharaoh Hound, Ibizan Hound, Cirneco dell\u2019Etna and Basenji.

The Pudelpointer is a fairly new breed, having only been developed in the late 1800s. German breeder Baron von Zedlitz is credited for developing the breed, using the German hunting poodle (Pudel) and English Pointers to create what he believed to be the ideal pointing, tracking, and retrieving gun dog that was suitable for work on both water and land. Using 7 specific pudels and over 100 different pointers, Baron von Zedlitz achieved his goal over the course of 30 years of selective breeding. The Pudelpointer was first introduced in America in 1956 and while it has yet to be recognized by the AKC, it was admitted into the Foundation Stock Service in 2016.

Some people think that Pugs are related to Bulldogs, and given the physical similarities between the two, it\u2019s hard to debate that theory. But this dog breed is generally of a disposition that is quite different than that of Bulldogs. They can generally be quiet and friendly, or sometimes rather rambunctious and outgoing. If you\u2019ve read this far, you\u2019ll probably agree that there\u2019s no breed quite like the Pug. Even its puppies have a cute name \u2013 Puglets!

If you\u2019re a Pug-lover, you\u2019ll probably find that no breed in the dog world quite pulls on your heart strings like this tiny creature. Pugs have Chinese origins, dating back to ancient China, making the breed an ancient and historic breed. These dogs were actually bred back in ancient China to be perfect complements to the Emperor\u2019s lap, which partially explains the form-fitting and lap-lounging shape that Pugs retain to this day today. There is even reference to a \u201cshort-mouthed dog\u201d in the works of Confucius. Pugs have become popular in the Western world as well. The Dutch East India Company imported these dogs to the Western world in the 16th century, giving Pugs as strong a history in Europe as many breeds. Pugs even became the official dog of the House of Orange in 1572. The breed can also be found in a number of historic European paintings and portraits. Pugs became popular in France in ensuing centuries. Josephine, before her marriage to Napoleon, had her dog carry messages for her. That dog was a Pug and one of many thriving in France at the time. Today, Pugs are known as mild-mannered dogs perfect for modern and city life \u2013 an odd thing considering how these dogs have enjoyed lavish surroundings even in the ancient World. However, Pugs are quite adaptable and amenable dogs who do well in practically every environment, no matter how big or small. Because Pugs can be traced so far back to ancient times, there\u2019s little to read about the pedigree. There are, however, some theories about what breeds this dog might be linked to. For example, many people believe that the Bulldog arose out of a three-dog mix that included the Pug. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have much more specific historical info available about the pedigree of these little bundles of joy. Pugs don\u2019t have a highly specific diet as far as dogs go \u2013 meats, vegetables and unprocessed foods generally work the best. Be sure to watch your dog\u2019s weight, however, as its short legs can lead to joint problems down the line. A Pug should have a slightly odd torso-to-leg ratio, but it\u2019s best not to exceed this to the point that your Pug is overweight. If you are in any way concerned about establishing or altering your dog\u2019s diet, it\u2019s always wise to consult with your veterinarian. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs may provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still only guidelines and should not be treated as gospel. All dogs are different after all, each with their own needs. The only person qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is a vet. So always consult with your Pug\u2019s good doctor before making any significant changes to the food that you pour into their bowl. Even its puppies have a cute name \u2013 Puglets! Pugs are generally considered a companion dog; they were often bred for royalty as \u201clap\u201d dogs and can be seen in painting as living out that exact role. For that reason, they are well-suited for city and apartment life. Pugs are great around children but can be strong-willed and thus difficult to train if you don\u2019t have a lot of experience in handling dogs. Should you choose to train them yourself, it\u2019s vital to focus on positive reinforcement and rewards. Overly negative training is closer to abuse and should be avoided at all costs. However, it\u2019s probably best to enrol your pug in some sort of training program. Not only will that take the pressure off, but it will help with the pup\u2019s socialization. Pugs can be heavy for their small frame considering that a lot of weight is in its torso and its disproportionately sized head. Generally a weight of around 18 pounds is where you want your dog to be at \u2013 but just try to keep your Pug looking healthy. As mentioned, Pugs are not quite the \u201cpack\u201d dogs that others might be, and as such, can be surprisingly stubborn rather than simply following orders. Pugs enjoy lounging around and can be relatively quiet compared to a lot of breeds of similar size. If you have children, you\u2019ll find that Pugs and children often get along famously. Since Pugs don\u2019t grow very large, the breed also seems to be in a permanent state of puppiness, which is enjoyable for children of all ages. Pugs can make good guard dogs capable of making noise and can occasionally bark at visitors. However, the won\u2019t offer must protection beyond some parks, so keep that in mind before making them a permanent guard fixture in your home. Unfortunately, the source of much of the Pug\u2019s cuteness can also be its downfall when it comes to health. The predominant features you notice on a Pug\u2019s face often make it susceptible to eye and face problems. Pugs are also not very good at handling heat, so it\u2019s best to make sure that you don\u2019t take them out on especially hot days or leave them out too long in the sun. Because Pugs live a generally slow daily life, frequent exercise as well as a healthy diet can be critical to making sure that your Pug lives a long and healthy life. It\u2019s also important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with your vet (especially as your pooch enters into its senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as soon as possible. This breed typically lives to around 12-14 years. Pugs aren\u2019t big exercisers by instinct, but they\u2019ll be perfectly capable of handling much of what you throw at it \u2013 just keep in mind that their short legs and heavier torso can make things a little less easier for them. Since these dogs are prone to obesity, much like Bulldogs, it\u2019s important to make sure that you exercise your Pug regularly. The Pug\u2019s general friendliness makes for a good city dog, which means that walking your dog in a busy city is a treat. You\u2019ll want to take these dogs out just to see people visibly react to the cuteness. It is quite a sight to behold. Pugs enjoy lounging around and can be relatively quiet compared to a lot of breeds of similar size. The American Kennel Club says: \u201cThe Pug is well described by the phrase \u2018multum in parvo\u2019 which means \u2018a lot of dog in a small space.\u2019 They are recognized for their even-tempers, playful personalities, and their outgoing, loving dispositions.\u201d The short coat of the Pug makes for easy maintenance, and as such, require little grooming. This breed can be everything from a light beige color to black. Pug puppies, known as \u201cpuglets,\u201d certainly have the best name for puppies in the entire dog breeding world. As expected, puglets are adorable, fragile, and easy to love. They need to be handled gently because their tiny little puppy forms are so fragile. Training and socialization should begin as soon as possible. Don\u2019t let those early and impressionable puppy days go to waste.

The dreadlocks that Puli usually sport give them a Rastafarian look however; they are from Hungary. Bred for herding, the Puli is also a good watchdog but quite safe around his human family. He is energetic and fun-loving, making the Puli a good choice as a companion for an active family. He is full of pep and can keep the kids in his family occupied for hours playing ball or Frisbee. The versatility of the Puli has caused him to be a favorite dog in Hungary for centuries. He could drive and protect herds during the day and stand watch over his family at night. This loving and loyal dog is smaller than other Hungarian herding dogs but not less needed or valued. Bred for herding, the Puli is also a good watchdog but quite safe around his human family. The true origin of the Hungarian Puli is rather unclear. It is accepted that Pulik traveled with invaders from India and Siberia however; there are some authorities who believe that this breed was developed in China. The Puli was always a herder and guard of livestock. Considering this breed bears a remarkable resemblance to Tibetan Terriers, it is widely accepted that they share some of the same ancestry. In the 1500s, the Turks nearly irradiated the breed. Fortunately, various breeding between the remaining Pulik, French herding dogs, and German herding dogs led to the creation of the Pumi and Mudi. The Hungarian dog breeds were not classified as breeds of their own until the early 1900s. Since then, each breed\u2019s own standard was created and the Puli became a recognized breed of its own. The Puli is an active and energetic dog so he needs to have a high-quality diet specifically formulated for his performance levels. Dogs that are out herding all day or doing agility courses will have different nutritional needs than one that merely romps in the yard playing fetch. Your veterinarian will be able to assist you in deciding which dry dog food formula is best for your Puli. Puli were bred to be independent as well as for their ability to make certain decisions while herding and protecting livestock.

These traits can make it difficult to train a Puli unless training begins from the time he is a pup. Highly intelligent and headstrong, the Puli requires an experienced trainer who can prove to be a leader without being aggressive. The use of tasty treats tends to make a Puli more interested in training sessions so have plenty on hand. If training continues throughout the life of the dog, a Puli can excel in obedience and herding trials, agility courses and the breed ring. Many have even gone on with their training and became certified as therapy dogs or water rescue dogs. With training, Pulik can do almost anything. Typically, Pulik weight between 25 to 40 pounds and stand from 16 to 17 inches tall at the withers. The Puli is meant to work herding livestock. He needs to feel that he has a job to do within the home. Sure, he is a terrific watchdog and that is an important job but he needs to do more. There have been Pulik known to happily perform household chores. One owner reports that her Puli is in charge of rounding up the stray laundry that her family haphazardly leaves lying around the house. Another owner states that he taught his dog to keep birds and rabbits out of his vegetable garden. It seems that this intelligent dog can learn to do nearly anything with proper training. Pulik are not friendly toward animals other than dogs. Introductions could well be recipe for disaster. The Puli does best in a canine- and human-only home with older children. Smaller kids that can be \u201cherded\u201d might fall or get hurt when the Puli tries herding them by nipping at their heels. For the most part, the Puli is a really healthy dog. The most common issues that tend to run within the breed are elbow and hip dysplasia, which could also be triggered by the dog\u2019s environment. Great caution should be taken to prevent your dog from slipping on tile floors, jumping on furniture or overexerting itself as a puppy. These things can and will exacerbate even the most minor hip and elbow problems. Other common concerns are progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, von Willebrand disease and diabetes mellitus. The Puli has the average life expectancy of 12 to 14 years. Pulik are athletes so they do require a fair amount of exercise. For an active family, this breed would be thrilled with romps in the yard, a bit of fetch and maybe a hike in the woods. Without proper exercise, the dog will become anxious and destructive. You never want to meet a bored Puli because there won\u2019t be a whole lot left of your belongings. When he\u2019s left alone, mentally stimulating toys should be provided to keep him out of trouble. After a hard day of work or play, the Puli will want to chill out with the family on the couch. Although active, he still needs time to relax with the family and get the attention that he loves so much. If training continues throughout the life of the dog, a Puli can excel in obedience and herding trials, agility courses and the breed ring. The American Kennel Club writes: \u201cIntelligent and possessing an excellent sense of humor, Pulik retain their \u201cpuppy\u201d attitude nearly their entire lives. The breed loves their family and home, and as such, is naturally protective and suspicious of strangers. Although they love the farm, Pulik can thrive in a variety of living situations due to their medium size, but owners must provide daily opportunities for exercise.\u201d The Puli was recognized by the AKC in 1936. Puli puppies are not born with a corded coat. It can take around four years to achieve a fully corded coat. In the first year, the coat should be bathed and brushed as with other dogs. After that, the coat should develop cords on its own. Occasionally, it will need some human intervention. Once fully corded, no brushing is needed. The Puli will not shed either. Baths should only be given when absolutely necessary because it can take two full days to dry thoroughly. Commercial dryers can do harm to the coat and skin so they should be avoided. The Puli\u2019s coat can come in a variety of colors. Most commonly, they dogs are black however; white and gray and reddish black are also found. There have been known to be light brown Pulik in Hungary but this color does not adhere to AKC standards. Puli puppies should immediately be enrolled in puppy kindergarten classes to get some basic training as well as socialize with other people and pets.

Throughout history, they have been used as guardians, but that\u2019s only owing to their imposing stature- these gentle giants don\u2019t have a strong prey drive and will protect their fellow furry roommates. A knight in furry armor, in a way! Even though this breed traces its origin to ancient Molosser dogs, until recently it was fairly rare outside its place of origin, so the Pyrenean Mastiff doesn\u2019t suffer from heavy inbreeding common for some purebred lines. As a result, you can count on these dogs to be quite healthy as a breed- especially considering their massive size.

Additionally, you should pay attention that their kibble is age appropriate- puppies, seniors, and adult dogs have very different dietary needs. It is especially important that you feed him a large-breed puppy formula until he is 18 to 24 months old to prevent him from growing too quickly. Otherwise, they could develop serious issues with joints and bones. To prevent bloating and overeating, split their daily dose of kibble into two or more meals.

The Foxhound was bred with dogs to produce the reddish quality of the Redbone Coonhound\u2019s coat, and since the turn of the century, the Redbone Coonhound has seen a relatively stable pedigree, aided by the aforementioned recognition of the American Kennel Club.

Throughout this breed description, you\u2019ll find out all that goes into making a Rottweiler tick and what separates it from other breeds of similar size. Rottweilers can make loyal and trustworthy pets that are worthy of the distinction of guard dog. The Rottweiler might seem like a recent breed given its German heritage, but the origins of the Rottweiler go back to the Roman Empire \u2013 ancient times. The ancestors of the breed would help Roman armies by functioning as a working dog, and one of the towns that ancient Roman armies would trek through is the town of Rottweil. As the breed developed, its role shifted from that of a working dog to become a more guard dog. Many Rottweilers were used during the Middle Ages by merchants who wanted to protect their pouches of money. These merchants would tie the pouch around a Rottweiler\u2019s neck \u2013 for many people, it was better than using a bank account! Rottweilers declined as the technology to protect items improved, but in the 1900s a new demand for police dogs rose and interest in the Rottweiler was revived. Today we know all about the aggressive but loyal Rottweiler and it has become a household name. Descending from those ancient Roman working dogs, the pedigree of the Rottweiler goes back to antiquity. For this reason it\u2019s hard to precisely track down the pedigree of this dog unless you\u2019re familiar with the types and breeds that Romans used to help herd cattle. Rottweilers descend from its own breed ancestors as far back as the Middle Ages.

Rottweilers are more versatile than many people give them credit for \u2013 this is, again, thanks to their general obedience and responsiveness to working with humans. Quality training is important in Rottweilers and if you haven\u2019t worked with dogs before, a Rottweiler is not always a good breed to start developing your skills with. Friendlier dogs like Labrador Retrievers are better large breeds for people without a lot of dog experience.\n\n Coming in at an average of over 100 pounds (many far over a hundred pounds in many cases), the Rottweiler\u2019s weight strongly depends on its height. Some males might weigh a very hefty amount \u2013 say, in the 140 pounds range \u2013 while females will also frequently weigh over 100 pounds. Rottweiler\u2019s outweigh many dogs that might look similar in size, so be sure that you give your Rottweiler a proper and healthy diet. Many people can be scared of Rottweilers because of the negative press many have received. The truth is, while this breed does relish a role of guarding and herding, they are not always aggressive. Many times, episodes of aggressiveness can be a result of bad ownership and training and not necessarily a problem that the breed has. The Rottweiler, like many dogs, will respond to perceived threats as well as fear. Since Rottweilers are such large, heavy dogs and have a reputation as being aggressive, this does not always make them friendly to new faces.

The Laika is an ancient landrace of dogs and the Russian-European Laika is the result of a breeding program that began in 1944. Early Laikas were not well suited to the agricultural lifestyle and uncontrolled breeding led to problems with the native population. By the early 1930s, few specimens remained which prompted the development of the breeding program by the All-Union Research Institute for the Hunting Industry in Kalinin. The breed was officially recognized by the FCI in 1980 and by the United Kennel Club in 1996 but is yet unrecognized by the AKC. The Russian-European Laika was developed from the landrace Laika dogs of the ancient Spitz type as part of a breeding program begun in 1944.

The Saarloos Wolfhound is unique in that it exhibits more natural wolf-like behaviors, as it was developed from crossing a German Shepherd with a wolf. The Saarloos Wolfhound was developed in 1935 by a Dutch breeder named Leendert Saarloos. Saarloos was particularly passionate about the German Shepherd breed but believed that most specimens of the breed were too domesticated \u2013 he wanted to breed some of the natural qualities back into the breed to improve its working ability. Thus, he crossed the German Shepherd with a female wolf that he got from the Rotterdam Zoo. The result was not quite what Saarloos was hoping for but subsequent crossings were more successful. Unfortunately, Saarloos died in 1969 but others took up the task. In 1975 the Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed and named it the Saarloos Wolfdog in honor of its creator. The Saarloos Wolfhound was developed from a crossing of a German Shepherd with a wild wolf. As a large-breed dog, the Saarloos Wolfhound should be fed a high-quality dry food formulated for large breeds. The Saarloos Wolfhound is also an active breed, so he may respond well to an active or working breed formula. You still need to be careful about overfeeding, however, to prevent obesity.

The Saarloos Wolfhound is a large dog, standing 24 to 30 inches tall and weighing anywhere from 70 to 90 pounds at maturity. Although the Saarloos Wolfhound has a wild appearance, this breed is loyal and devoted to family. These dogs can be somewhat reserved at times, particularly around strangers, and they are not inclined toward confrontation or aggression. This breed is a high-maintenance breed because they are very powerful, both physically and in terms of their strong will, so they are not the best choice for inexperienced dog owners. These dogs do well when given firm boundaries \u2013 they like having a strong leader and they like knowing their place. This breed can be socialized to other dogs and pets, and early training is recommended to prevent the development of behavioral problems and dominant tendencies. The Saarloos Wolfhound has a life expectancy between 10 and 12 years which is on par for dogs of this size. Though the Saarloos Wolfhound is generally healthy, there are some health problems to keep an eye out for. Some of these conditions include hip dysplasia, pituitary dwarfism, degenerative myelopathy, and various eye problems. The average lifespan for the Saarloos Wolfhound is between 10 and 12 years. As a cross between the German Shepherd and a wild wolf, you can expect the Saarloos Wolfhound to have fairly high energy levels and high needs for exercise. This breed needs a long daily walk or a brisk jog and will also benefit from having a fenced yard in which to run.

When it comes to this article, we\u2019re going to talk about one of the most instantly recognizable breeds of dog out there today, if only because it blocks so much sunlight simply by standing around: the Saint Bernard. The Saint Bernard originally made a name for itself as a Swiss rescue dog, and indeed tales of Saint Bernard rescues survive and abound to this very day. This perhaps partially explains the popularity and reputation of Saint Bernards as friendly, unassuming dogs that are only looking to do good things. In many cases, this is exactly what having a Saint Bernard will tell you about the powerful breed. But there\u2019s more to this breed than simply being a powerful rescuer: as you\u2019re about to find out, it can make an excellent family pet that gets along with many of the range of characters you encounter each day. Let\u2019s dig a little deeper and find out what makes the Saint Bernard tick. Is there any animal that can get away with being so big and so friendly as the Saint Bernard? Many of us associate the Swiss with watches, bank accounts, and army knives, but throughout history they have been very admirable pet breeders who have given us very unique and powerful breeds. One of these breeds is the Saint Bernard, whose most defining characteristic is its size. With a large head and overall body, the largest St. Bernard on record supposedly weighed some 367 pounds. It\u2019s a good think these Saint Bernards are so powerful, because they\u2019ve done a lot of heavy lifting as rescue dogs. The Swiss bred these dogs \u2013 relatives of Sennenhunds \u2013 hundreds of years ago, considering there are paintings depicting large, Saint Bernard-like dogs as early as 1707. Even in this painting the dogs were portrayed as a calm, obedient breed. The Saint Bernard takes its name not directly from the Saint, but from the Saint Bernard pass in the Western Alps where many of the dogs would frequent in its early days. Related to the classically Swiss Sennenhund or mountain dog, the Saint Bernard\u2019s history is closely intertwined with the history of Switzerland and the Alps. Because they were bred to be rescuers, this is how they got their name, especially fitting considering the treacherous conditions the Alps range can provide. This gives every Saint Bernard a particular pedigree that many people enjoy. Its instinct to protect and to rescue is one of its defining traits and it makes them especially appealing as great friends and companions for people who live near treacherous conditions. Given that Saint Bernards are so large, they require a similarly large diet in order to maintain a healthy body weight. It\u2019s important to remember that this doesn\u2019t mean they should be overfed, however. Plenty of meat and poultry will provide a good caloric intake while vegetables should be mixed in for nutrition. The Saint Bernard originally made a name for itself as a Swiss rescue dog. Saint Bernards should be raised to socialize with people and animals in order to prevent them from becoming wary of strangers and other dogs. When a Saint Bernard realizes that other people and dogs are simply a part of their life, it will grow up to be rather unassuming and will not be overtly territorial. This requires diligent training from a pet owner especially if you\u2019re raising a Saint Bernard from a puppy stage or acquiring an adult Saint Bernard without a lot of training. The Saint Bernard can be anywhere from 100 to 200 pounds and even heavier. The breed itself is typically husky and heavy, so try to avoid the temptation to over exercise them, which could lead to an underweight dog. Proper training is essential for Saint Bernards because of how large they grow: it\u2019s easy to handle toy dogs that are unruly as opposed to a St. Bernard that outweighs you. You want to make sure that your Saint Bernard is properly socialized and understands the typical boundaries it has. Some Saint Bernards will not know its own size, so be sure to give them plenty of room in areas they frequent the most. As you would expect from a large dog of the Saint Bernard\u2019s stature, joint problems, especially as the dog grows and ages, can present issues such as hip dysplasia. These dogs can also be prone to epilepsy, seizures, and heart problems. With the bigger size comes a shorter life, around 8-10 years in life expectancy, which is, to Saint Bernard enthusiasts, one of the true negatives to owning a St. Bernard. It\u2019s also important to remember that Saint Bernards can grow fast, so you\u2019d better be prepared for that if you\u2019re raising a Saint Bernard from a puppy. Saint Bernards are large and have plenty of calories to burn but should not be over exercised because of potential joint problems, particularly if you have a heavier Saint Bernard under your supervision. Regular exercise is a must to prevent boredom and over-excitement. Saint Bernards should be raised to socialize with people and animals in order to prevent them from becoming wary of strangers and other dogs. The St. Bernard is described by the American Kennel Club as \u201cpowerful and muscular in build, Saints possess a gentle and dignified temperament.\u201d The white-brown coat of the Saint Bernard is a defining characteristic. Saint Bernards will shed and as such require regular grooming. Given the small size and cuteness of puppy Saint Bernards, it can be difficult to remind oneself that these dogs will need to be raised and trained with its ultimate weight and frame in mind. Be sure to expose your young Saint Bernards to other dogs and people so they don\u2019t become wary of them, and be sure to set boundaries for them from a young age.", "facts": " AKC Working Families with children, active singles and seniors, experienced handlers, houses with yards Gentle, dependable, friendly, patient", "tags": "Epilepsy, Extra-Large Breeds, joint problems, Saint Bernard, seizures, St. Bernard, Switzerland, working, "}, "saluki": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/saluki/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/saluki1.jpg", "name": "Saluki", "type": "dog", "text": "With the moniker of \u201cThe Royal Dog of Egypt,\u201d it\u2019s quite apparent that the Saluki is an elegant and graceful breed of dog.

The Saluki\u2019s good looks are often confused with a trimmed Afghan Hound. Although they are both sighthounds, they are two distinctly different breeds. Salukis are wonderful companions and get along quite well with older children. They are not tolerant of younger kids who might pull their hair, ears or tails or climb on top of them. They are best suited for adult and teenaged companions. You can continue reading to learn more about the Saluki. The Saluki is an amazing athlete, a formidable hunter and a loyal companion. It is believed that the Saluki is one of, if not the oldest breed of dog. Its history predates any history records found. They were prized by many, including the ancient Pharaohs of Egypt. The Saluki was so favored by the Pharaohs that the mummified remains of Salukis have been found entombed with royal Egyptians. These beautiful dogs were used not only for companionship but for hunting gazelle and other game. In 1840, the Saluki was first brought to England. This mysterious breed was first recognized by the AKC in 1929. Because of the antiquity of the breed, there isn\u2019t even speculation as to how it was developed. It is essential that the Saluki be fed a high-quality diet of dry food. Although many people feed their dogs only once per day, quite a few Saluki enthusiasts free feed their dogs. This means that they leave dry kibble available for the dog all day. Few Salukis will overeat and become overweight therefore; free feeding should not be a problem. Free feeding can also help to prevent bloat, which has occasionally been a problem in the breed. Although the Saluki is an intelligent dog, training can prove to be problematic. Although the Saluki is an intelligent dog, training can prove to be problematic. Salukis are extremely sensitive so positive training methods are indicated. Raising your voice, yelling or harsh reprimands will ruin any training session with a Saluki. Kind, gentle instruction and plenty of yummy rewards will work wonders while training this breed. It is wise to have all training sessions in an area free from distractions. Once a fuzzy bunny or quick moving squirrel passes by, the Saluki will not be able to resist chasing it down. This doesn\u2019t mean the dog is stupid; it simply has an inherent drive to chase down prey. The Saluki can weigh between 35 and 70 pounds and be somewhere from 23 to 28 inches tall at the withers. Males are generally larger than females. Salukis are reserved and sensitive dogs by nature and quite gentle with the adults and older children in their families. However, they are not the right breed for those with small children. They have an even temper but will not tolerate young kids well. The Saluki is quite intelligent but headstrong as well which can make training problematic. The Saluki\u2019s elegant appearance and exotic good looks often fool people into thinking that they are simply sweet couch potatoes. They can be really mischievous and wreak havoc on a home and garden when unattended. Although a wonderful breed, the Saluki is not the best choice for every family. The major health issues that Saluki owners face are heart problems, cancers, autoimmune issues and allergic reactions. Heart problems found within the breed include various grades of heart murmurs, congenital heart defects, Cardiomyopathy, heart valve problems, Congestive Heart Failure and irregular heartbeat. Leukemia, Lymphoma, Hemangiosarcoma and various masses are just some of the cancers that have been diagnosed in Salukis. Salukis are highly sensitive to medications and anesthesia so veterinarians should use caution when treating this breed of dog. The average Saluki lives to be 12 to 14 years old. Because the Saluki is an athletic sighthound, it requires a fair amount of exercise. The best form of exercise for a Saluki is free running in a securely fenced yard. It will need to have at least 400 feet of straight run for the dog to be able to get to full stride. Owners should be aware that Salukis can jump into the air in order to catch prey so the fence should be at least six feet high. This dog should never be left off leash outside of a fenced enclosure. His keen hunting instincts will kick in once he sees something that he considers to be prey, often the neighbor\u2019s cat. Once he catches it, he will kill it. This is what he was bred to do. Unfortunately, once the Saluki takes off, he is very hard to catch and potentially could be killed by a car. Of course, Salukis love their creature comforts. After a good play session, they can usually be found napping on the couch or snoozing the afternoon away in bed. Salukis are reserved and sensitive dogs by nature and quite gentle with the adults and older children in their families. The American Kennel Club states: \u201cAlthough the breed appears graceful and fragile, don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 the Saluki is an avid hunter and possesses the strength and endurance to chase quarry over long distances and difficult terrain.\u201d The Saluki was first recognized by the AKC in 1929. The smooth and silky coat of the Saluki is so soft that is feels like a young kitten\u2019s. The tail, legs and ears have long feathering that accentuates the long, tall silhouette. Salukis can be found in a variety of striking colors including white, gold, red, fawn, tricolor, black and tan as well as grizzle and tan. The most common coat colors are fawn and gold. Grooming isn\u2019t a big chore for the Saluki owner. Simple brushing to ensure that the feathering doesn\u2019t mat and coat is free from debris is enough. Frequent baths are necessary to keep the skin healthy. Saluki puppies are absolutely gorgeous but they need socialization from the time the puppy goes to his new home. Puppy obedience classes are also a good idea as training should always begin early as possible. It\u2019s best to crate train the puppy because Salukis are inquisitive and mischievous and can not only damage your home but can also do harm to himself by chewing power cords or eating other objects.", "facts": " AKC Hound Families with older children, active singles, houses with yards, hunters Calm, quiet, sensitive, reserved", "tags": "bloat, Egypt, gazelle, heart problems, Hunting Dogs, Saluki, sensitive, shy, sighthound, "}, "samoyed": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/samoyed/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/samoyed1.jpg", "name": "Samoyed", "type": "dog", "text": "Originally intended to be a working dog, the Samoyed has all the qualities you\u2019d expect in this type of dog.

Wonderful companions for a variety of households, Samoyeds possess great watchdog abilities and are amazing with children. An ancient Russian breed that originated in Siberia (one of the harshest environments in the world), Samoyeds were used for sledding, herding, guarding and keeping their owners warm. These dogs were kept by a native tribe to ancient Siberia known as the Samoyeds. The Samoyeds were used to pull sleds, herd reindeer, and hunt animals \u2013 including the polar bear.  Even though it is largely used as a companion dog today, it still retains many of the traits that made it a staple in Siberia. Recent DNA analysis of the Samoyed has proved that this breed is one of the 14 most ancient dog breeds. The Samoyed was recognized by the AKC in 1906. Samoyeds do well on a raw diet, which is no surprise, as its ancestors were used for hunting. Even if you go the dry dog food route, feel free to throw your dog some extra meat and even a real bone to chew on. As well, your Samoyed may enjoy raw fruits and vegetables. An excellent companion dog, the Samoyed loves being around people. Be warned: undertaking the training of a Samoyed is not for the faint of heart. You\u2019ll need more than skill to train this intelligent and independent dog. Don\u2019t get us wrong \u2013 of course it is possible, but it will take a lot of time, patience and consistency in order to be successful. You do have something going in your favor \u2013 the Samoyeds are eager to please. It will take a firm hand to train them and this breed does need consequences of its actions, so use positive reinforcement and praise as part of the training process. It\u2019s important to make it fun and energetic for your dog, since it can be somewhat resistant to obedience training. You must always make sure you keep the upper hand at all times during the training process. That way, your position as alpha is understood and unchallenged. Since it is a pack dog, the Samoyed will be happiest once it knows its position in the pack. Start training your Samoyed early and your life with this dog will run a lot smoother. It\u2019s also a great way to stop bad habits such as barking, chewing, jumping up, nipping, and grabbing onto objects. Male Samoyeds weigh 45 to 65 pounds, while females weigh 35 to 50 pounds. An excellent companion dog, the Samoyed loves being around people. This breed is great with children and needs lots of attention and affection. The Samoyed will not do well if it is left alone for long periods of time. The breed suffers from separation anxiety and is known to act out as a result of being away from its family (this includes destructive chewing and incessant barking). So if you work full time outside of the home, this is not the breed for you. Since this is a herding dog, you\u2019ll have to watch for instincts such as nipping at your children\u2019s heels. Your Samoyed will also chase cats, deer, and livestock if given the opportunity to do so. It\u2019s a natural instinct to them and a very difficult to break. Even though it is an intelligent dog, the Samoyed can be difficult to train. You should use consistent training methods and make sure the whole family is onboard in order to provide a unified front. As well as using treats for good behavior, make sure that there are consequences for bad behavior. The most common health problems known to affect the Samoyeds include hip dysplasia, cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetes. Hip dysplasia affects the hips and can range in severity from moderate to severe pain. If left untreated, cataracts may lead to blindness, as will glaucoma, and diabetes is often known to reduce the lifespan of the Samoyed. Samoyeds have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years. A working dog by nature and ancestry the Samoyed needs to be kept busy. Be sure that your Samoyed gets plenty of exercise, as it helps it stay healthy and happy and it helps relieve some of the pent up energy. The more energy it uses up, the less of the impact of separation anxiety and destructive habits. The Samoyed is quite strong, as it used to pull sleds and hunt polar bears, so be careful when playing with this breed. Even though it is an intelligent dog, the Samoyed can be difficult to train. The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cA hardy and eager worker, the Samoyed is known for black lips that curl slightly at the corners into the \u201cSamoyed smile.\u201d Bright and alert, he likes to stay busy and enjoys participating in agility, herding, weight pulling, sledding, pack hiking, conformation shows and more! His heavy, weather resistant coat is suitable for very cold climates and should be pure white, white and biscuit, cream or biscuit.\u201d The beautiful white coat that Samoyeds are known for is a double coat. The long course outer coat is made up of hairs that protect the undercoat and keep it clean. The short, dense undercoat offers warmth. Weather resistant, the Samoyed typically blows a coat or sheds twice a year. The Samoyed\u2019s coat coloring is either white or biscuit, or a mixture of the two. Proper grooming is a high maintenance ritual, but necessary. When grooming your Samoyed, divide the hair into sections, combing first, and then brushing in order to achieve the best results. You can\u2019t resist these adorable balls of white fur, but even though they are cute, be warned that it is going to grow into a powerful adult.

The Sapsali (also known as the Sapsaree), is native Korean dog. The exact origins of the Sapsali breed are unknown but early documentation suggests that the breed was present in Korea as early as the Three Kingdom period which lasted from 37BC to 668AD. The Sapsali was a cherished companion among royal Korean families for many years, believed to be an instrument of good fortune. In fact, the meaning of Sapsaree is \u201cOne that roots out evil spirits.\u201d That explains their nickname of \u201cGhost Dog.\u201d A popular saying states that the Sapsarees drive away ghosts because ghosts are deathly afraid of it. After the Silla Unification period in Korea the popularity of the breed spread to the upper class. During the Koryo and Chosun Dynasties, the breed became more common among average Korean citizens but the breed nearly went extinct around the time of the first World War and the Korean War that followed. A group of professors from the Kyungpook National University sought to revive the breed during the 1960s, though the Sapsali wasn\u2019t truly out of the woods until the 1980s.

Early socialization is required, however, to prevent the development of problem behaviors and aggressive tendencies. This breed is rarely aggressive toward people but may not get along with other dogs. The Sapsali is generally regarded to be a healthy breed though little is known about its pedigree.

The breed is recognized by the Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI) as well as the Korean Kennel Club. The distinguishing characteristic of the Sapsali breed is its long shaggy coat. These dogs come in all colors and patterns including various combinations of black, gold, red, brown, and gray. The Sapsaree typically has long hair that falls over its eyes, much like the Old English Sheepdog. Because this breed has such a long coat, regular brushing and grooming is required to keep shedding to a minimum and to preserve the health of the coat. Some dogs exhibit curly or wavy coats while others have straight hair \u2013 it is largely a matter of breeding. The average litter size for the Sapsali is 4 to 7 puppies.

These dogs were developed to exhibit a lively temperament, strong scenting ability, and versatility in the field. Though primarily used as a hunting dog, the Schillerstovare has the potential to get along with other household pets and can do well with children as long as they receive plenty of training and socialization. For the most part, however, this dog is a one-person breed. The Schillerstovare\u2019s name translates to the Schiller Hound in English, though it is a Swedish breed. The Schillerstovare was developed during the 1800s by Dr. Adolf Patrick Hamilton and Per Schiller. At the time, both were trying to develop a better Stovare-type hound and they worked together to achieve their goal. Using the English Foxhound as the foundation for the breed, they eventually came up with two distinct breeds \u2013 the Hamilton-Stovare and the Schillerst\u00f6vare. These two breeds were similar in appearance but the Hamilton-Stovare was taller \u2013 they also differed in color with the Schillerst\u00f6vare being brown and black, the Hamilton-Stovare tricolor. The exact origins of the Schillerstovare breed are unknown but it is thought that his predecessors hunted the forests of Sweden as far back as the Middle Ages. These dogs became the early ancestors of the majority of Sweden\u2019s hound breeds and Per Schiller used them heavily in his development of the Schillerst\u00f6vare. In addition to using the English Foxhound, he also used English Harriers to add size. The first Schillerst\u00f6vare was exhibited in 1886 but the breed wasn\u2019t officially named until 1907. The Schillerstovare was developed in Sweden from the English Foxhound and English Harrier as well as other Swedish hound breeds. As a medium- to large-sized dog, the Schillerstovare should be fed a high-quality dry food formulated for adult dogs. Because this breed was developed specifically for hunting, however, he may do well on an active or working breed formula. Schillerstovare were developed to exhibit a lively temperament, strong scenting ability, and versatility in the field. The Schillerstovare is a highly intelligent breed and generally easy to train. He does, however, have a dominant nature which may be challenging for inexperienced dog owners. This breed requires plenty of early training and socialization as well as consistent training throughout his life. Because they devote themselves to one person, the Schillerst\u00f6vare may not respond to commands from other family members, though that may not always be the case. The Schillerstovare is a medium- to large-sized dog, standing between 19.5 and 24 inches tall and weighing 35 to 55 pounds at maturity. Bred as much for their lively temperament as their strong hunting ability, the Schillerstovare is a friendly and active breed. These dogs can be somewhat wary around strangers but they form close bonds with their owner and they tend to be one-person dogs. The Schillerst\u00f6vare can make a good family pet, however, due to their fierce loyalty and strong affection, but they need early socialization and training if they are going to be kept with non-canine pets and children. Keep in mind as well that this breed was not developed to hunt in a pack and he may not do well around other dogs. The Schillerstovare is naturally suspicious of strangers but not inherently aggressive. They have a loud howl that makes them good watch dogs, but they are too gentle in nature to do well as a guard dog. The Schillerst\u00f6vare can be somewhat dominant by nature so they may not be the best choice for inexperienced dog owners and they may try to dominate other household pets. Making sure that this breed is well trained and thoroughly exercised can reduce the risk for problem behaviors. The Schillerstovare is generally a healthy bred, evidenced by his long lifespan. Like all dogs, however, he may be prone to certain health problems as well as field injuries. Some of the health problems that may affect this breed include hip dysplasia, kidney infections, glaucoma, allergies, cherry eye, and bloat.

To maximize your dog\u2019s lifespan, be sure to feed him a healthy, high-quality diet formulated for dogs of his size and activity level. As a hunting breed, the Schillerstovare has high exercise requirements. These dogs need at least an hour of vigorous exercise each day and they will appreciate having a fenced yard in which to run. Training your dog for hunting or various dog sports can provide extra exercise as well. The Schillerst\u00f6vare is not currently recognized by the AKC but he is recognized by the FCI and the UKC. The FCI classifies him in Group 6 as a Scenthound and the UKC as a Scenthound as well.

In terms of color, this breed is typically some shade of tan, fawn, or ginger with a distinct black mantle. This breed sheds moderately, so you should plan to brush your dog two to three times per week. The average litter size for the Schillerstovare is 3 to 7 puppies. Because the breed only reaches a maximum weight around 55 pounds, puppies may reach their full size before they turn 1 year old.

Well-suited for closed environments (it is even considered a quality breed to have with you on a boat), the Schipperke is energetic and playful, and has a confidence that means it will not get lost in the shuffle of your daily life. And since it is considered one of the better breeds for getting along with children, you will be more comfortable letting your children learn to raise and interact with dogs around a Schipperke. So with all of that in mind, are there any weaknesses to this smaller, fox-like breed that really make it a bad choice for any particular type of owner? Most breeds have their shortfalls and weaknesses, as well as their strengths. Like with many breeds, you\u2019ll find that the advantages of having a Schipperke, such as its energy, can be weaknesses for particular types of owners. Even so, the Schipperke is highly versatile and can make an excellent addition to your household. Well-suited for closed environments, the Schipperke is energetic and playful, and has a confidence that means it will not get lost in the shuffle of your daily life. As we mentioned the Schipperke\u2019s affinity for boats, it should be noted that the word \u201cSchip,\u201d in Flemish means ship! The Schipperke actually descends from boat dogs, having originally been bred by a captain in Flanders. It also descended from a sheepdog known as the Leauvenaar, and the dog was bred down in size until it reached its currently small stature. It is related to the Black Sheepdog but was breed far enough away that it became known as its own breed with its own defining characteristics. In the 19th century, the dog became very popular in Belgian households \u2013 probably because of the qualities we\u2019ve already described \u2013 and started appearing in dog shows before the end of the century. Great on fishing trips and boat trips in general, this sea-faring dog has also made a name for itself guarding boats, which gives them an extra punch as a guard dog in your own home. Having been bred as a boat dog, there\u2019s no doubt the pedigree of the Schipperke makes it especially sea-faring and pleasant to be around when on boats. As a descendant of a sheepdog, it still carries some sheepdog-like qualities, and is even related to the Black Sheepdog, which also has the same ancestors but was bred into a different type of dog. This makes the Schipperke and the Black Sheepdog a bit like cousins, though this sheepdog should not be considered part of the Schipperke\u2019s overall pedigree. Like so many other breeds, this dog enjoys a good cut of meat, and you can get wholesome, nutritional food like vegetables into its diet by mixing this meat in with those ingredients. Because they\u2019re so small, they can be a bit prone to weight gain, so be sure not to over-feed them. Gaining a pound as a Schipperke is not the same as gaining a pound as a St. Bernard. The Schipperke is highly versatile and can make an excellent addition to your household. Difficult to housebreak sometimes, this dog is energetic and friendly, but shouldn\u2019t test your patience too much in its actual training. Instead, it can be surprisingly responsive, which isn\u2019t always the case in smaller dogs with a lot of energy. Making sure that you train this dog to be highly understanding of its role in the household is important, though they will sometimes take to this role somewhat naturally. As with any breed, you\u2019ll want to be sure that you can exercise effective leadership with patience and discipline. Just weighing 12-18 pounds, these tiny dogs can be light like foxes and just as quick. Its thicker coat can sometimes hide a weight gain, so try to keep tabs on your Schipperke\u2019s weight on a regular basis. It is energetic, as noted, and generally friendly and playful, sometimes even mischievous. This breed gets along well with children and often relate to children on their level, making them very fun and \u201cfunny\u201d house pets. Because they get along with children and other pets, they can fill a much-needed void in a household by being the lone dog to pair with your cats, if your cats have had troubles with other dogs. Schipperkes are generally receptive to good training and not always as rambunctious as you might think. They are well-suited for apartment life, and can be difficult to keep tabs on if you don\u2019t have a yard that\u2019s fenced in. Overfeeding should be avoided. The breed is susceptible to a number of health problems including hip dysplasia, cataracts, and Progressive Retinal Atrophy. Despite their health problems, this breed can often live from 15-18 years. Sometimes known to be \u201ctireless,\u201d they should get plenty of both play and exercise. This will make them tougher to tire out, despite their small size, and you\u2019ll be surprised what a little bundle of energy these dogs can be. If you want a small dog with a high tolerance to exercise, this might be the right breed for you. The Schipperke is energetic and generally friendly and playful, sometimes even mischievous. The American Kennel Club describes the Schipperke as: \u201cThe small, foxlike Schipperke is known for its mischievous expression and distinctive black coat, which stands off from the body and is harsh to the touch. This enthusiastic, joyful, and sometimes willful dog has a thickset and cobby body, and lacks a tail.\u201d Considered a generally self-grooming animal, you\u2019ll still want to make sure your Schipperke is regularly brushed to maintain an overall coat quality. Typically having a dark coat with a medium length, it\u2019s not hard to see when a Schipperke is coming your way\u2026 except maybe at night. Schipperke puppies can be mischievous, energetic, and rambunctious, but let them play as long as you set boundaries for them and you raise them to socialize well with people and other pets.

It was used to take down Scottish Roe Deer but today\u2019s dog is happy to go for a trot around the block and then, curl up on the sofa. It is believed that the Scottish Deerhound was bred down from the Irish Wolfhound, with the addition of Greyhounds to decrease the immense size. Through the 1700s, this breed was exclusively owned by royalty; only earls and those higher in the hierarchy were permitted to have this regal breed. During the World Wars, the number of Scottish Deerhounds plummeted. Fortunately, some breeders maintained their stock and continued promoting the breed. Today, the population of this elegant dog is quite stable. The Scottish Deerhound is a large dog and requires a lot of food. He should be fed a high-quality, dry food.

The American Kennel Club states: \u201cWhile he possesses a quiet and dignified personality in the home, the Scottish Deerhound may try to chase any furry animals that run past him.

Well, depending where you are, you might have a different answer. But perhaps no terrier is as unique or easy to recognize as the Scottish Terrier. Take one look at the pictures presented in this article and you may find that you recognize the breed right away. That\u2019s because three former Presidents, including George W. Bush, have had Scottish Terriers at the White House. But whatever your political leanings, the Scottish Terrier doesn\u2019t have to be a breed reserved only for U.S. presidents \u2013 it can make a great pet for you and yours. So what makes a Scottish Terrier special? As you\u2019re about to find out, there\u2019s a great deal of information about the Scottish Terrier that inspires a cult following of this playful, easy-to-get-along-with breed. Like many breeds of dog, you\u2019ll find that the relatively peaceful personality makes for a perfect pet. Just make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise, affection and discipline and you\u2019ll rarely go wrong. You\u2019ll find that the Scottish Terrier\u2019s relatively peaceful personality makes for a perfect pet. Scottish Terriers, of course, trace their roots back to Scotland, where its time in the highlands was shared with other breeds. Technically, experts don\u2019t really know the origins of the Scottish Terrier in terms of its ancestral heritage or pedigree, which we\u2019ll get to in a moment. The Scottish Terrier does have a rich history, dating back to perhaps the 15th or 16th centuries, but really only made its own as a formal breed during the 19th century. This makes the Scottish Terrier similar to a great deal of other breeds that didn\u2019t gain official recognition until a relatively recent time in human history. As mentioned, the Scottish Terrier\u2019s ancestral roots are a little iffy. Like the legend of William Wallace, people just aren\u2019t totally sure about what exactly went on in Scotland. Early records of Scottish Terriers, or at least Scottish Terrier-like creatures, go back to around the year 1500 when a man named Don Leslie described them in a book. There\u2019s information out there that states that Scottish Terriers are closely related to old breeds like the Aberdeen Terrier. The Aberdeen Terrier was just another name for the Scottish Terrier. Actually, Scottish Terriers come from a larger family of dogs known as Syke Terriers. This group was eventually split up into a number of breeds including the Scottish Terrier we all know and love today. Scottish Terriers actually have a high propensity for a number of illnesses \u2013 which we\u2019ll discuss later \u2013 and making sure that your terrier gets a steady and healthy diet with plenty of exercise is even more important than with many dogs. Scottish Terriers will enjoy a range of foods as do most dogs, particularly meat and meat-flavored kibble. Mixing in vegetables with this kind of diet can be a good idea, but it\u2019s best to speak to a veterinarian before you make any food decisions regarding the Scottish Terrier. Scottish Terriers can be terrifically playful and energetic. Scottish Terriers can be a bit of a handful to train due to a breed-wide general stubbornness and a behavior that many people would describe as aloof. Scottish Terriers can be terrifically playful and energetic, but this can be a cause for frustration if you don\u2019t have a lot of experience in working with dogs. A relatively small breed, both male and female Scottish Terriers will grow to about 20 pounds or so in weight, usually without a lot of variation. If your Scottish Terrier matures well above this weight, it\u2019s important to remember that you should think in percentages. Five pounds overweight doesn\u2019t sound like a lot to you, but for a dog, it can represent a fifth of its total weight. As mentioned in the section on training, the Scottish Terrier can be a love-\u2018em-or-leave-\u2018em breed. They\u2019re playful and energetic but also stubborn and independent. They might be considered to behave a little more like energetic cats, but if you have worked with smaller dogs before there\u2019s probably little about the Scottish Terrier that you can\u2019t handle. With a higher propensity to developing cancers than other dogs, it\u2019s important to monitor your Scottish Terrier\u2019s health with a close eye. Frequent trips to the veterinarian will be required particularly as your dog advances in age. Other issues like Scottie Cramp and von Willebrand\u2019s disease might have interesting names but you don\u2019t really want to see your terrier develop them.

They make excellent play dogs \u2013 have your kids play in the yard with your Scottish Terrier, as it\u2019s a great way to wear them both out. If you don\u2019t exercise your Scottish Terrier on a regular basis, expect them to become antsy and even irritable. Scottish Terriers are playful and energetic but also stubborn and independent. The American Kennel Club notes that the Scottish Terrier \u201cwere introduced to America in the 1890\u2019s and continue to remain a common fixture in American households.\u201d Perhaps the distinguishing feature of Scottish Terriers, its thick and unique dark coats often makes it a favorite with children.

His funny antics will melt even the hardest of hearts. Although this breed loves his family tremendously, he is quite content to be left alone while the humans are gone for the day. Sealyham Terriers are confident and sure of themselves. Although not technically watchdogs, this breed will surely alert you when anyone or anything is around. Known to those who love them as Sealies, they do require consistency or they will overtake the home. Training and socialization started at an early age will help keep this feisty pup in line. Fun-loving and typically the clown of the family, Sealyham Terriers are playful and comedic. Originating in Wales, the Sealyham Terrier was named for the estate of the gentlemen acclaimed for its development in the 1800s. The breed was used to hunt fox, badger and otters on and in the ground. His size and tenacious nature made him perfect for the job as well as a wonderful household companion. It is believed that the Sealyham Terrier was developed by Captain John Edwardes. The combination of Dandie Dinmont Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, Wirehair Fox Terriers, Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Welsh Corgis and the now extinct Cheshire Terriers resulted in the breed we know today. Because the Sealy is small but active, he needs a diet of high-quality, dry food. Feeding dry kibble can help to prevent oral hygiene problems such as bad breath, tooth decay and gum disease. Be sure to feed the Sealyham Terrier the proper amount of food as indicated on the bag as Sealies have a tendency to overeat and become overweight. Sealyham Terriers are feisty and strong-willed dogs. Sealyham Terriers are feisty and strong-willed dogs. They require an assertive but kind family that won\u2019t let the dog walk all over them. The Sealy needs regular training sessions to keep him from misbehaving. Consistency, along with loads of praise and treats, is best when working with a Sealy. Training should begin from the time you get the new puppy. This should go on throughout the dog\u2019s life to ensure that he never forgets his place within the family. Sealies were bred to hunt small animals so they do remarkably well at Earthdog competitions. Being the mellowest of the terriers, this breed can be wonderful therapy dogs as well as family companions. Of course, with a lot of hard work, the Sealy can do well in obedience trials as well as in the breed ring. The Sealyham Terrier should ideally weigh between 20 and 25 pounds and stand 10 \u00bd tall at the withers. An independent dog, the Sealy is perfectly fine with being left alone while his humans work but he is also thrilled to snuggle up on their laps when they get home. This breed does tend to be relentless barkers however; they are not quite as bad as other terrier breeds. Their personalities and clown-like antics will keep the family laughing for hours. The Sealy might be small but he doesn\u2019t understand the concept of this. Because he can be food and toy aggressive, this breed is not appropriate for families with young children. Considering his strong instinct to chase, he should not live with cats or other small animals. If raised with another dog in the home, the Sealy will get along famously with it, but can be aggressive toward strange dogs. Sealies are pretty healthy dogs however; they do have some health issues that are common within the breed. Progressive retinal apathy, lens luxation, cataracts, glaucoma and lacrimal punctual aplasia seem to be problematic for this breed. Sealyham Terriers are also prone to having back problems which can be very debilitating. Sealyham Terriers usually live to be 12 to 15 years of age. Although Sealies need daily exercise, they don\u2019t need a lot of it. A vigorous walk around the block each day or tossing a ball in the yard is certainly enough exercise for this playful dog. Sealyham Terriers can live happily in a small apartment or on a sprawling ranch; they aren\u2019t picky about their outdoor options because they prefer being inside. He only requires a minimal amount of exercise therefore; he will be happiest with a family that predominantly hangs out indoors and chills out on the sofa. An independent dog, the Sealy is perfectly fine with being left alone while his humans work but he is also thrilled to snuggle up on their laps when they get home. The American Kennel Club states: \u201cThis proud, compact, sturdy little dog makes an ideal companion. Charming and inquisitive, he loves his family, but as a spirited terrier breed, needs something to keep his active mind occupied. The breed may enjoy hunting on the farm, but can thrive anywhere if they are allowed to enjoy a brisk daily walk. Brushing and combing is necessary at least twice a week to remove mats and trimming is necessary every month.\u201d The Sealyham Terriers was first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1911. Sealies have medium-length, double coats that are weather resistant. The coat was established to keep him protected while hunting badger, otters and foxes. The outer coat is quite wiry while the undercoat is very soft to the touch. This breed should be completely white however; lemon or tan markings can often be found on the ears and head. The markings are called points. The coat actually needs to be hand stripped seasonally, if being shown but the average pet can have the coat intact. Hand stripping is very time-consuming. If the coat is clipped, it will feel a lot softer but the dog will shed more often. Bathing should be done seasonally unless the dog becomes filthy or smelly. The average Sealyham Terrier should be brushed thoroughly several times each week. This will help to prevent the coat from getting tangled and matted. Sealy puppies are bundles of energy and tend to be nippy and jumpy. For this reason puppy kindergarten classes should begin immediately after vaccinations.

Although the Border collie has replaced the Shetland Sheepdog in the Shetland Islands when it comes to herding responsibilities, Shetland Sheepdogs are still popular all over the world as show dogs, pets, and herding dogs on farms.

Courageous, generally friendly and responsive to training, the Shiba Inu can be a determined and happy companion that enjoys a good variety of terrain and can handle plenty of exercise. If you\u2019re considering the Shiba Inu as a pet for your family, you\u2019ll be encouraged to know that it gets along with children, other pets, and is not an overtly aggressive dog. There\u2019s a lot that goes into developing a breed like this, and the Shiba Inu\u2019s history tells us all about its modern form. Although a bit stubborn at times, like many confident dogs, the Shiba Inu will be happy to enjoy your company and can be considered a dog that is versatile in terms of play, exercise, and social skills. And considering it is a relatively small dog, the Shiba Inu also has the advantage of not scaring off any neighbors! Here is an overall profile of this Japanese breed. Courageous, generally friendly and responsive to training, the Shiba Inu can be a determined and happy companion. As already stated, the Shiba Inu is native to Japan, which is a rare quality, and is actually the smallest of the breeds that can say so. Shiba Inus were used over the years to explore and hunt through the terrain and thick brush that marks so much of the Japanese island, giving it a ready-made confidence when it enters this kind of brush anywhere you take it. In fact, the word Shiba in Japanese refers to brushwood, and since Inu means dog, you get the idea where the Shiba Inu got its name. Throughout its history, the Shiba Inu has made a good companion dog for hunting, which is interesting considering the typical hunting dogs most westerners are accustomed to, the breed is actually relatively small. But because of its instincts, its confidence, and its willingness to explore difficult terrain, the Shiba Inu has earned a reputation amongst the Japanese as an excellent hunting dog indeed. While the Shiba Inu was devastated by the effects of World War II, it has since rebounded and been developed into the breed we now know today. We know that the Shiba Inu was bred, despite its small stature, to be able to hunt a variety of animals, including bear and boar, as unlikely as the prospect might seem. Because this dog is smaller, it is able to navigate the brushwood from which it takes its name, and it\u2019s only assumed that the breed comes from similarly small ancestors who were also ideal for this type of terrain. Today\u2019s Shiba Inu have a strong pedigree because of the re-ascension of the breed in Japan as well as across the world. It is one of the most popular breeds in all of Japan and is growing in numbers across the western world as well. The Shiba Inu\u2019s diet is not uncommon, despite its hailing from a country known for its unique cuisine. Like many dogs, he will be especially attracted to meats and it loves good, whole ingredients. Feeding the Shiba Inu scraps can be a bad idea as it is relatively small and can be a little prone to putting on extra weight. The Shiba Inu will be happy to enjoy your company and can be considered a dog that is versatile in terms of play, exercise, and social skills. Considered highly trainable and easier to housebreak, you won\u2019t find many troubles with the Shiba Inu. It can be stubborn at times, because of its confidence and strong instincts, but if you demonstrate that you\u2019re the pack leader, there should be no problems keeping your dog on a strict discipline program. Weighing around 17-23 pounds, the Shiba Inu is the smallest native breed in Japan, and will use its small stature for extra navigation skills around your house. He\u2019ll will be good at getting around obstacles even when you think it\u2019s too big for them. A strong and confident personality sometimes makes for stubbornness, but a genuine openness to discipline and a friendly disposition easily override those qualities in the Shiba Inu. You\u2019ll find it makes an ideal house pet as it is friendly with children and other pets, giving it a flexibility that even some other friendly dogs don\u2019t quite possess. The most common health problems of the Shiba Inu relate to joint problems, which is not rare for dogs but a little unusual for dogs of its size. You might even notice kneecap problems in this dog, not a common problem in other dogs. A solid, long life can be expected at around 12-15 years, depending on a number of factors. Though small, the Shiba Inu has a surprising thirst for some forms of exercise and will be able to catch up with you easily if you take it out often. Regular walking should be considered a normal habit, and certainly something you\u2019ll want to get into with any dog. The breed might also want to get away from you at times to explore natural landscapes. Considered highly trainable and easier to housebreak, you won\u2019t find many troubles with the Shiba Inu. The American Kennel Club says of this breed: \u201cThe Shiba has an independent nature and can be reserved toward strangers but is loyal and affectionate to those who earn his respect.\u201d A winter-ready coat for the Shiba Inu is one of its distinguishing characteristics. As a double-coated dog, it has plenty of fur. If showing your Shiba Inu, you can be penalized for \u201cmessing\u201d too much with the coat, such as keeping it too trim.

Upon their introduction into the Western society, the Shih Tzus became the foremost dog grooming breed and a sensation across dog beauty events and competitions.   Owned by Chinese royals as prized house pets for over a thousand years because of its association with Buddha, the Shih Tzu is thought to have been bred by crossing the Lhasa Apso or Tibetan mountain dog and Pekingese. Taking the guardian and companion traits from the Lhasa Apso, and the loveable personality from the Pekingese, the Shih Tzu emerged as a distinct and balanced breed.The Ming Dynasty kept Shih Tzus as its favored canine companion before the breed was discovered by the rest of the world and introduced to England. The Shih Tzu was recognized by the AKC in 1969. It\u2019s hard to find a culture that doesn\u2019t respect these adorable balls of fluff. Needless to say, one of the foremost aspects of their pedigree and their looks is their coat. An ideal Shih Tzu will have long, flowing hair that is silky and smooth to the touch. Such a coat can be easily formed into intricate arrangements, which is a show stealer at any gathering. Furthermore, features that define them even more are a small, stubby snout, a fluffy tail curled over the back, and a very prominent underbite. Virtually every Shih Tzu pupper boasts these features, but the coat will require attention to truly shine and come to the forefront. For any dog, it\u2019s crucial to get their diet just right. Meeting your pet\u2019s nutritional needs should be one of your primary objectives as a pet owner. That\u2019s because a well-balanced diet will promote good health and improve your dog\u2019s quality of life. The Shih Tzu does best on a diet based on high-quality dry dog food. Feeding kibble the most convenient way to get all the essential vitamins and minerals into your pet\u2019s bowl, and most vets will recommend this route. Just make sure to pick a kibble from a premium brand that will suit your pet\u2019s size (small), age (puppy, adult, or senior) and activity level (low to moderate). Since the Shih Tzu is primarily an indoor dog and prefers to spend its time on your lap, you should take care not to overfeed this breed. They are at risk for quick weight gain and can become obese if you indulge their voracious appetite (Seriously, they will eat just about anything that you put in front of them. It\u2019s your job to moderate because Shih Tzu\u2019s will never even consider it). Naturally, their small frame doesn\u2019t handle that extra fluff very well, and it can put a lot of stress on their bodies. From joint issues to diabetes, obesity can lead to a host of health issues for your Shih Tzu pet.  Be sure to follow the feeding guide recommendations on the kibble bag and don\u2019t free feed these dogs. It\u2019s best to divide the recommended serving size into two separate meals. It will keep your pooch full throughout the day but won\u2019t mean you\u2019re overfeeding. In some cases, a raw diet or nutrition based on home-cooked meals are a better option for a dog. However, you should consult with a professional before making a switch. Canine nutrition is not a thing to play with- make sure to act only if you get a nutritional plan vetted by a veterinarian. It is so important to consult with your vet before making any change to your dog\u2019s diet. While blogs and dog food packages offer useful feeding guidelines, all dogs are different and these guidelines are not gospel. Only your vet will have the expertise and familiarity necessary to identify the specific dietary needs of your personal pup. So always check with your vet first.  Of course, with their long and flowing coat being their pride and joy, it too will require a balanced diet to keep its lustre. Without sufficient nutrients and vitamins, the keratin in their hair won\u2019t get the \u201cfuel\u201d it needs. Without that, there won\u2019t be that iconic sheen, the flow, and a silky smooth feel to their fur, and Shih Tzu won\u2019t be able to reach their potential. If you are a proud show dog owner, pay attention to the diet to ensure good looks.   The Shih Tzu is a great go-to family pet, but because of its small size and its need for companionship, he\u2019ll need to be an inside dog. As soon as the Shih Tzu has been weaned and settled in its new home, obedience training should begin. It\u2019s important to note that this breed has a short attention span, you\u2019ll get the best results if you train in small increments of time. They won\u2019t be able to focus on training for long and certainly won\u2019t retain any training once their little minds have wandered elsewhere. Shih Tzus are smart and curious, so make these lessons fun. Patience is key. If you take your time and regularly schedule short training sessions, your dog will learn quickly. It never hurts to use incentives either, such as a positive kudos and treats for a job well done. Positive reinforcement training methods are very efficient and will get you the best results while deepening the bond that you have with your pet. On the other hand, being harsh or relying on aversive training techniques will only be counterproductive and damage the relationship you\u2019re building with your Shih Tzu. That\u2019s closer to abuse than training and should be avoided at all costs.  Start with the basics such as teaching your puppy to walk on a leash or where to go potty. Early socialization is very important as well. It will ensure your Shih Tzu puppy grows up to be a friendly and sweet little pet. Once you move on from the housebreaking and obedience training, you can see if your pooch has a talent for agility or learning fun tricks. With the right training approach and a lot of patience, it\u2019s amazing what a Shih Tzu can learn to do.  Both male and female Shih Tzus can weight anywhere from nine to 16 pounds. Because it is smaller dog, make sure your dog doesn\u2019t become overweight. Still, due to their small size, these doggos are nimble and full of energy. If given plenty of chance for exercise, the risk of those extra pounds coming on will be minimal.  One of the most famous lap dogs around, the Shih Tzu is a forever faithful companion. On top of that, this dog is delightful, gentle, and sweet natured. The Shih Tzu is a fun-loving and spirited pup with a cheery disposition.

Since Shih Tzus have short snouts, the breed is prone to snoring and wheezing as well as other respiratory health issues. With its short legs and long backside, spinal disc conditions can also occur.  Still, such health problems are more common and probable to appear with seniority. Eye problems are not uncommon, as its long hair gets in its eyes and causes eye infections from constant irritation. This can be prevented by keeping your Shih Tzu\u2019s hair neatly trimmed. Actually, hair care will be one of the major responsibilities for every Shih Tzu owner. Failing to do so results in matted and tangled hair and plenty of other side issues.

Roughly 30 to 60 minutes of daily walks will keep your Shih Tzu happy and healthy. It\u2019s a great way to make sure they don\u2019t put on any extra weight. You can also let your pet play in a securely fenced yard if you have one.

One of the most famous lap dogs around, the Shih Tzu is a forever faithful companion. The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cA compact and solid dog, the Shih Tzu\u2019s long, flowing double coat is its most distinctive feature. The word Shih Tzu means \u201clion\u201d and although this dog is sweet and playful, he is not afraid to stand up for himself!\u201d The Shih Tzu\u2019s beautiful long coat comes in several different colors. Some coats are tri-colored with white, black, and shades of tan. While others may be black and white, tan and white, or brown and black.

Those numbers are pretty incredible for dogs of this size, who generally have small litters. As for the price of Shih Tzu puppies, it will all depend on the power of their pedigree. A Shih Tzu puppy that\u2019s meant to be a pet can cost anywhere from $500 to $1500, but show-quality dogs cost much more. Sources indicate that the price of show-quality Shih Tzu puppies ranges between $2,000 to a whopping $10,000. These dogs are coveted and that type of popularity comes with a big price tag.  Once you get your Shih Tzu puppy home, it will need to be trained as soon as possible. Timely training and socializations make for a happy and well-behaved dog.

This breed hails from Japan where it is a primitive breed similar to the Shiba Inu. The Shikoku has been named a natural monument of Japan where it is the ideal companion for active outdoor enthusiasts. If you\u2019re looking for an intelligent and active breed that likes the cold, this breed might be a good fit. Good luck finding one! An ancient Japanese breed, the Shikoku is one of six breeds native to China. In between the smaller Shiba Inu and the larger Akita Inu in size, these dogs were originally used for hunting boar in the mountainous regions of the Kochi Prefecture. Also known as the Kochi-ken, there were once three varieties of this breed \u2013 Awa, Hongawa, and Hata. All three were named for the area in which they were bred and all were tough, agile, and intelligent dogs. Though the exact origins of the breed are unknown, it is known that that Shikoku was developed by Matagi hunters. First known as the Tosa Ken, he was later renamed to prevent confusion with the Tosa Fighting Dog. Efforts to protect the breed began in the 1920s and the breed was declared a natural monument in 1937. The breed is not yet recognized by the AKC but is part of the Foundation Stock Service and has been recognized by the FCI and UKC. The Shikoku is one of six native Japanese breeds and an ancient breed at that. The exact origins of this breed are unknown, but it is thought to have been developed for hunting boar in the Kochi Prefecture. As a medium-sized breed, the Shikoku would do well on a high-quality adult dog food diet. They need plenty of protein to maintain lean muscle mass with healthy fats for energy. Because these dogs are very active, they may do better on an active or working breed formula. These recipes have higher fat levels to increase the calorie content and therefore the energy. The Shikoku is very intelligent and can respond well to training when there is a firm and consistent authority figure. Training should be started at a young age and early socialization is equally important. These dogs learn very quickly, and they are generally not as stubborn or independent as other Japanese breeds, though they do get bored easily. Keep your training sessions short and fun to ensure that your Shikoku stays engaged. The Shikoku is a medium-sized breed, standing 17 to 22 inches tall and weighing between 35 and 55 pounds at maturity. The Shikoku is a very intelligent breed that bonds closely with family. Socialization is important because he can be somewhat aloof around strangers and may be suspicious of unfamiliar dogs. These dogs do get along well with children if they are raised together and the children treat the dog with respect.

This breed needs plenty of human interaction and mental stimulation to keep him from getting bored and developing problem behaviors. As an ancient breed the Shikoku is very healthy with no known inherited health problems specific to the breed. Even so, these dogs may be prone to certain health problems including elbow dysphasia, hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, epilepsy, and allergies. The average lifespan for the Shikoku is 12 to 15 years. As an active hunting breed, the Shikoku has very high needs for exercise. These dogs require at least an hour of exercise per day as well as mental stimulation to prevent boredom. They will also appreciate having an outdoor fenced area in which to run and play. The Shikoku is not currently recognized by the AKC but is a member of the Foundation Stock Service. He has been recognized by the FCI as an Asian breed and the UKC as a Northern Breed. As a dog of the spitz-type, the Shikoku has the typical double coat. The topcoat is straight and harsh to the touch with a softer, dense undercoat. The top coat is longer on the chest and neck with some feathering on the back of the legs. The primary color for this breed is black or red, typically with variations in sesame and tan. These dogs have black noses and brown eyes. The average litter size for the Shikoku breed is 3 to 5 puppies. Because these dogs are highly intelligent and active, they should be started with training and socialization as early as possible. This breed is loyal and protective with family, so he will form strong bonds with children when raised with them.

The Shiloh Shepherd is a cross between a purebred German Shepherd and Alaskan Malamute. The Shiloh Shepherd is a designer dog breed from the United States. In the 1970s, Tina M. Barber, who was a German Shepherd breeder, sought to create a Shepherd that reminded her of the dogs that she grew up with in Germany. She wanted the dogs to be large, intelligent, and great with families. It was not until 1990 that she separated her new breed from the AKC and began maintaining registry records for Shiloh Shepherds. The Shiloh Shepherd is a cross between a purebred German Shepherd and Alaskan Malamute. The Shiloh Shepherd is a big breed that needs to eat quite a bit in order to maintain its energy and strength. Many breeders and owners are advocates of a raw diet for the breed, as they find it provides exceptional results with respect to their health. Your dog is an individual, so he may need more or less food, depending upon his age and activity level. Always talk to your vet about the best food to nourish your pet, and to discuss raw and homemade options. The key is to provide your pet with the highest quality food that has natural ingredients for health and vitality. The Shiloh Shepherd is protective, loyal, and loving.

They are protective and want to keep you safe, and they are also friendly and loyal. Before you bring one of these dogs home, though, make sure that you have the time to dedicate to his needs. These canines enjoy being close to their human family and thrive on experiencing fun activities with you. Like other hybrid canine breeds, the Shiloh Shepherd could be prone to the health problems that commonly affect its parent breeds. However, hybrid dogs can be hardy and healthy, and there\u2019s no way to predict an individual dog\u2019s long-term health, as every animal is different. Shiloh Shepherds might be prone to developing tumors, panosteitis, and hip dysplasia or other skeletal disorders, as well as bloat, small intestine bacterial overgrowth syndrome, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The Shiloh Shepherd has an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years. Shiloh Shepherds need to participate in physical activities every day. These dogs like being challenged and trained, and they will do well with daily walks that are brisk and long. You can also take your dog on a hike or for a jog, and you can let him run off-leash at the dog park with other canines. It is best if you have an enclosed, safe backyard space where your pooch can run and play as well. Give your pet some toys to play with while indoors, as they can help keep your dog mentally stimulated. However, if you do not lead an active lifestyle, this breed, which can become destructive as a result of boredom, isn\u2019t the right choice for you. Shiloh Shepherds are revered for their courage, confidence, and intelligence. The Shiloh Shepherd is recognized by the American Canine Association (ACA), the American Pet Registry, Inc. (APRI), the American Rare Breed Association (ARBA), the Dog Registry of America, Inc. (DRA), the International Shiloh Shepherd Registry (ISSR), the National Kennel Club (NKC), the National Shiloh Breed\u2019s Registry (NSBR), the Shiloh Shepherd Breeders Association (SSBA), and The Shiloh Shepherd Registry (TSSR). A Shiloh Shepherd could feature a coat that\u2019s plush or a coat that\u2019s smooth. If the coat is plush, it will be medium in length and it will have a dense undercoat, along with a mane that runs from the chest to the neck. On the other hand, if the coat is smooth, it will be medium in length and thick, but the outer hair will be rougher to the touch. If your Shiloh Shepherd features the plush coat, you\u2019ll need to brush him regularly in order to keep the fur free of tangles, smooth, and clean. However, if the coat is smooth, minimal grooming will be required, so brushing will be necessary less often. These dogs do shed constantly, and they will also shed more heavily on a seasonal basis. Expect to clean up fur around your house, but daily brushing should help minimize this problem. Even though the Shiloh Shepherd grows up to be a hefty adult, these pooches are small when they are puppies, and they need to be handled with care. If you can start socializing and training your puppy from a young age, he will grow comfortable and confident around a variety of people and animals. It\u2019s also important to be aware that Shiloh Shepherds experience slow bone growth that could make them susceptible to injuries, so puppies shouldn\u2019t be allowed to perform strenuous activities until they are mature.

Some are looking for a dog to laze around their home like their home with their humans. Not all dogs are up for this sort of lifestyle though. Some pooches are lazy. Others, not so much! No one would ever accuse the Siberian Husky of being a lazy doggo. Boasting a working class background, the Siberian belongs to a class of dogs called a Spitz. These dogs work hard. With its strong and muscular, yet deceptively compact body, this breed does more than pull its weight when it comes to dog sleds. At the same time, these pups aren\u2019t exclusively loved for their ability to work. They are also absolutely gorgeous creatures. Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the Siberian Husky is its eyes. These peepers grab your attention, especially when both of them are an icy blue. They can have brown eyes, as well as one brown eye and one blue (heterochromia). Regardless of the colour, they are eyes that are all too easy to get lost in. Before bringing a Siberian Husky into your home, you should be aware that it is a pack animal, so it needs companionship and to feel like it is part of the family. This is a dog that requires a great deal of responsibility, so it\u2019s important to understand what you are getting yourself into before bringing one home. Read on to find out more about Siberian Huskies. With its strong, muscular yet compact body, this breed does more than pull its weight when it comes to dog sleds. Known as an Eskimo sled dog, the Siberian Husky got its start in Siberia- hence the name. As we all know that is a place famous for its extremely low temperatures and this breed is built to survive under tough conditions. The Chukchi tribe in Siberia used Siberian Huskies for herding animals and pulling sleds. This breed is powerful and capable of withstanding extremely cold temperatures. It also likes to work and be useful. Making its way to Alaska in the early 20th century, fur traders also used the Siberian Husky in races. The breed\u2019s big break came during an outbreak of the disease diphtheria. Due to the cold weather conditions, the Siberian Huskies were used to transport the valuable medicine in Alaska. That\u2019s when these pups became valuable members of the Alaskan community. Admiral Peary was also known to use Siberian Huskies for his Antarctic expeditions to pull sleds of equipment. A true working class breed, the Siberian Husky was used during World War II rescue missions in the Arctic regions. These days, the Siberian Husky makes itself useful by participating in a variety of sled races (like the Iditarod in Alaska) and by making wonderful pets for families. That\u2019s likely where you\u2019ll come in. As one of the oldest breeds of dog, As one of the oldest breeds of dog, the Siberian Husky descends from the original Inuit sled dog or Qimmiq. It\u2019s interesting to note that Husky is a take on the nickname \u201cEsky\u201d, which was once applied to Inuit communities and their dogs. The American Kennel Club recognized this stunning breed in 1930 and the United Kennel Club followed suit in 1938, recognizing it under the name Arctic Husky. Siberian Huskies have been a popular show dog in the United States ever since. As for the rest of the world, though, this recognition came sometime later in history. FCI recognized the breed in the 1960s but created a definitive standard some 30 years after that. The breed is also recognized by The Kennel Club from the United Kingdom and all other major canine organizations around the world. Diet is extremely important for your pet\u2019s overall wellbeing. Without balanced, healthy meals to give your dog fuel for everyday activities, they can quickly develop a myriad of issues and conditions, so it is crucial  to make sure that their nutritional needs are met to a T. Of course, while there are some general guidelines for all dogs, it\u2019s advisable to consider unique traits and history of specific breeds when creating a meal plan for your pet. After all, the needs of a tiny Chihuahua, a brachycephalic Pug, or a large and muscular working dog such as the Husky can\u2019t be the same. In fact, these important differences start all the way back when these impressive dogs were living in the cold and harsh shores of the Arctic Ocean. Fats and protein are the most important sources of energy to a Siberian Husky. Historically, hard-working Siberian Huskies in their original environment ate a lot of fish and other meats, such as locally available mink and otter. These dogs are used to surviving as pure carnivores. Naturally, this diet would be hard to replicate in most domestic environments- not to mention that the lifestyle and habits of a modern-day Husky and their ancestors are hugely different. Thankfully, this means there\u2019s no need to exclusively feed these beautiful animals raw flesh since your Husky will probably won\u2019t spend his days pulling sleds through snow and ice. Today, these dogs do well on rich and diverse diets that include lean meat, healthy fats, and fiber from dog-safe veggies. However, if you plan on going this route, it\u2019s crucial to consult with a veterinary specialist to make sure that you\u2019re not missing some essential nutrients and putting your dog\u2019s health at risk. While there are plenty of online experts out there happy to provide dietary tips for your dog, wise pet owners should be wary of relying too heavily on this sort of information. All dogs are different after all. Only your vet is qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch.  When it comes to feeding commercial pet food, the Siberian Husky will require premium quality kibble made from all-natural ingredients. Cheap dry food is full of fillers and, oftentimes, dubious ingredients and generally isn\u2019t suited to provide all the necessary nutrients, let alone in a high-quality form. Again, considering the Husky\u2019s unique history as well as their activity levels and build, it is best if the kibble is high protein- meaning that meat is the primary ingredient  on the list and makes up the most of the formula. It should also be suitable for their size and activity level, as well as their age. As a rule of thumb, a high-quality formula for large and athletic breeds usually matches a Husky\u2019s needs. Of course, even if you are planning on feeding your Husky kibble, it\u2019s wise to consult with your vet before settling into a feeding schedule.  Another important part of a Siberian Husky\u2019s diet is the portion size- it\u2019s not always as simple as bigger dogs need bigger meals and vice versa. Their origin had a forming influence on their metabolism and dietary preferences. Given that these dogs were bred to live a hard working life in the unforgiving Siberian and Alaskan climates, that dictated a need for stocking calories. As a result, this breed is very prone to becoming overweight, even with an active lifestyle. Simply put, no matter how much playtime and exercise you offer as a pet owner, it will be no match for the strenuous life of a working dog in an extreme climate. For that reason, feed them roughly 70 percent of the recommended kibble amount and make sure to adjust the servings of homemade food accordingly. Of course, needless to say, even with this reduced caloric intake, regular exercise is an absolute must. The Husky is an intuitive dog and will learn well in an obedience class, as this environment is set up for learning. Smart and highly trainable, the Siberian Husky likes to push boundaries. This breed will try to assert itself as the leader of the pack. So you must step in immediately to correct the dog if any problem behaviours start to pop up. It is important to establish dominance as the alpha leader early, so that the Husky knows what to expect and will respect your authority. However, this must be handled with a gentle touch. It\u2019s all too easy for firm discipline to turn into abuse and that must be avoided at all costs. All you have to do is make sure that you are assertive and confident when you train your pet, showing them you are the boss with the firmness of your voice and calmness of character, and not resorting yo yelling or punishment- not only that it will damage the bond you are building with your pet but it will also be counterproductive in terms of training.  The Husky is an intuitive dog and will learn well in an obedience classes, as this environment is set up for learning. When taking the lessons home, your dog may not obey you. Therefore, it\u2019s important to start obedience training as a puppy and establish consistent boundaries at home. If you allow an exception just once, the Siberian Husky will take advantage of it and continue to push the issue. Patience and persistence will be your friend during training. Training will certainly be a challenge with this breed, but it cant be overcome with a loving, yet firm hand. When it comes to socialization, the Siberian Husky integrates well with other animals and humans when socialized properly and early on. Try to keep your Siberian Husky busy with activities to keep it happy. If your Husky gets bored, the pup might find ways to stimulate himself that you won\u2019t appreciate, such as chewing on furniture or digging in the backyard. These dogs need plenty of attention, so bringing another furry companion into your home might go a long way to ensuring a healthy socialization process. Siberian Huskies thrive as part of a pack. Male Siberian Huskies weigh in at 35 to 60 pounds, while females tip the scales at 35 to 50 pounds. They can quickly gain weight, though, due to less exercise than they require or overfeeding, so be sure to pay attention that your pet is within the recommended weight limits- dog obesity can be the cause of a range of serious health issues. You\u2019ll find the Siberian Husky to be a happy dog that will become easily attached to its family. Energetic, fun and playful, the Husky is sociable and can even be quite laid back under the right circumstances. Even though this pooch is smart and amenable to training, the Siberian Husky has a mind of its own. They can get up to trouble if they are given enough attention. So make sure to keep an eye on your Husky, especially during their mischievous and impressional puppy years. Since the Siberian Husky is active, it will need a home with a large yard. If you don\u2019t have a yard, you must get your Husky out for vigorous exercise every day. Without enough exercise to burn off their surplus of energy, huskies can become destructive as a way to avoid boredom.   Training is a great way to control some of this exuberance and must be started as a puppy in terms of socialization (getting along with other pets and even housebreaking). Obviously, this is not a breed of dog that would thrive in an apartment or even in a city. They need space to thrive. Because the Siberian Husky can be laid back, it makes this breed a poor choice for a watchdog. You won\u2019t really hear the Siberian Husky bark. Instead, it chooses to communicate via a sound similar to that of a wolf, sort of like a howling noise. The Siberian Husky breed is generally a healthy one. There are still a few concerns to watch out for, including hip dysplasia, cataracts and corneal dystrophy.  The Siberian Husky also suffers from a skin condition called dermatitis, which is easily treated with zinc. Occasional bronchitis, asthma and gastric issues can also be a problem. It\u2019s important to maintain regular check ups with a veterinarian (especially as your husky ages) so that any potential health issues can be spotted and treated early. Siberian Huskies have a life expectancy of 11 to 13 years. As the Siberian is happiest working, it needs a lot of physical activities. Take your dog for walks or hikes, or if you live in a cold climate, get your dog into sled pulling and mushing opportunities. If you live in a warmer climate, be sure not to overwork your Siberian Husky in order to avoid overheating (these are dogs used to cold climates, after all). If you don\u2019t live in a snowy climate, you may want to try urban or dryland mushing with your Siberian Husky. With this activity, you run on trails using specially designed scooters, with two wheels for one or two dogs, or three-wheeled rigs for three or more dogs. Energetic, fun and playful, the Husky is sociable and can be quite laid back. The American Kennel Club recognized the Siberian Husky in 1930, and the breed has only seen a rise in popularity over the years. In fact, in the last couple of years, Huskies are becoming very sought after owing to the popularity of the TV show Game of Thrones and the direwolves it features. In 2018, Siberian Husky climbed to the number 14 on the AKC\u2019s list of most popular dog breeds in the United States. Here\u2019s what this prestigious canine organization says about the breed: \u201cThe Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses.

This breed comes in a variety of colors and patterns, although many of these dogs have white tips on the tail in addition to white legs, paws, and facial areas. Some colorations include the black and white Siberian Huskies or even a rare rusty red and white combinations. You will most likely see grey and white, totally blond, and a blending of several of the listed colors as well. Some Siberian Husky puppies will start with gorgeous mask and body coloring that changes to a slightly duller color in adulthood. The fluffy and cute Siberian Husky puppies will steal your heart in an instant. On average, a female has litters with 4 to 6 puppies. Once you bring your Siberian Husky puppy home it\u2019s important to start with basic training and socialization. Establishing yourself as the pack leader early on will help a lot. You don\u2019t want to give your cute puppy enough time to figure out they can be the boss of you. They will take advantage of that situation very quickly.  Begin with basic obedience training and potty training before moving on to more complex commands or training for dog sports when your puppy grows up a bit. Also, you should make sure to expose your new pet to people outside the family, other pets and dogs, as well as let them be around children (supervised) to make sure that they are socialized properly.

Many speculate that the breed was named so because of its speed. The Arabic word for \u201cfast as the wind\u201d is Sloughi.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is one of these dogs.  Considered an \u201cold-time\u201d breed of dog with a rich history across both American and British lineage, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a tenacious and lovable dog with heaps of courage in just about everything it does. If you\u2019re looking for an assertive dog that will make its presence known to strangers, this is the exact breed that you\u2019ve been looking for. Generally friendly to strangers and very eager and energetic, this dog can become an instant hit and become known as \u201ccharacters\u201d among your family and friends. Sadly, not every element of this dog breed is so bright and sunny. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier tragically gets this temperament from a rich and sometimes ugly history that included dog fighting. Although this checkered past might be a turn-off for some people while researching dog breeds, actually meeting a Staffordshire Bull Terrier will yield an unexpected friendly experience that can actually be quite endearing. If you\u2019re looking for a city dog that is content to live in your apartment and sit alone for hours at a time, you should probably move on. For a variety of other tastes, however, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a perfect companion. So, is The Staffordshire Bull Terrier the right dog to bring home to your family? You\u2019ve come to the right place to find out. Keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away. Everything that you could possibly want to know about this remarkable animal is about to be revealed. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a tenacious, lovable dog with heaps of courage in just about everything it does. Originating in Staffordshire, England over a hundred years ago, the dog was originally bred out of Bulldogs and smaller terriers like the Manchester Terrier \u2013 thus giving the dog its entirely appropriate name of \u201cStaffordshire Bull Terrier.\u201d As Bulldogs could not be used for dog fighting in those days, a new breed with similar tenacity was required, but after dog fighting was finally made outright illegal, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier lived on as an excellent worker and companion dog. Eventually, the breed gained recognition by the British Kennel Club in 1935, and it wasn\u2019t long before the Staffordshire Bull Terrier became a favorite at the shows, winning championships early on in its recognized history. Today it is considered a perfectly solid candidate at dog shows and can definitely win big points with an assertive personality. A well deserved happy ending for a pooch that didn\u2019t have the happiest origin story. Having been bred from terriers similar to the Manchester as well as Bulldogs, it\u2019s not hard to see where the Staffordshire Bull Terrier gets its pedigree from. A simple look at the Staffordshire Bull Terrier will yield you perfectly reasonable estimations as to its immediate ancestry. Because the pedigree is so easy to discern, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier can be considered a strong breed in and of itself, even though it plays a bit of a \u201chybrid\u201d role. The pedigree of hailing from working-class and fighting dogs has not especially made the Staffordshire Bull Terrier a violent dog. It has been many generations since those unfortunate origins and these dogs tend to be quite docile and friendly now. With a voracious thirst for exercise and activity comes an equally voracious appetite, but as always it\u2019s important to remember the size of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and feed it accordingly. It\u2019s easy for a 150-pound human to overestimate just how much food a dog needs, even if many dogs intimate that they can eat whatever you throw at them. If you are ever concerned about either establishing or altering your dog\u2019s diet, then it is always wise to consult with a veterinarian first. While pet blogs and dog food manufacturers provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still guidelines and should not be treated as gospel. All dogs are different after all, each with their own needs. Only your vet is qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch. So always rely on them for advice on what to put in your pup\u2019s bowl. Generally friendly to strangers and very eager and energetic, this dog can become an instant hit and become known as \u201ccharacters\u201d amongst your family and friends. Strong training from an early age is important with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. It should be properly socialized to other dogs and to people, and it should certainly learn the boundaries of acceptable behavior in a home setting. For example, too much growling, showing of teeth, and even playful biting should not be considered acceptable despite how often it seems your Staffordshire Bull Terrier is acting on instinct. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a dog that will get a lot of use out of chew toys, so be sure to find a few that it likes. As always, it\u2019s important to rely on positive reinforcement and reward-based training when raising your Staffordshire Bull Terrier. These aren\u2019t just the most successful training techniques, they are the only acceptable ones. Negative and punishment-based training is closer to abuse and should be avoided. Not only is it a horrible way to treat your dog, but it will never deliver  the results that you seek. Although strong and confident, the dog is only medium-sized and will weigh up to about 40 pounds in males and up to around 35 in females. Going any higher than these maximum weights should be considered overweight. As noted, the temperament of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a main attraction if you like a dog that is assertive, friendly, and confident. Many people can be afraid of confident dogs, but the Staffordshire Bull Terrier isn\u2019t a terribly aggressive dog unless raised improperly or not giving proper training from its time as a puppy. If you are the type of owner who likes to view a dog as an equal, you will probably not have an entirely successful relationship with your Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Early training and socialization are of course vital to ensuring that your Staffordshire Bull Terrier develops the friendliest possible disposition, but that independent streak will always remain. It\u2019s huge part of this particular breed\u2019s charm. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is prone to cataracts (which is not unusual in terriers), as well as hip dysplasia. Also, watch out for gas in this dog \u2013 it sounds like a joke, but it won\u2019t be a joke once you experience it! It\u2019s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a vet to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. A solid life expectancy of 10-16 years, barring health problems, should be expected in most dogs of this breed. Like any other dog, regular exercise is key here. But given the breed we\u2019re talking about, you\u2019ll want to make sure the Staffordshire Bull Terrier gets enough exercise that it can actually be tired out. It will make a much better companion indoors if it doesn\u2019t get antsy and instead gets its fill of mouth-related activities (think Frisbees and chew toys) as well as running around and generally being a dog. These pups have a great deal of energy, so if you don\u2019t help them burn off that energy, they will burn through that energy in more mischievous ways that you won\u2019t appreciate. The temperament of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a main attraction if you like a dog that is assertive, friendly, and confident. The American Kennel Club calls this breed \u201ca smooth-coated dog with great strength for his size. He is active and agile and comes in six color varieties: solid red, fawn, white, black, blue, or brindle. Today, he serves primarily as a family companion and is seen in the show, obedience and agility rings.\u201d With short coat that comes in a variety of colors, it might be hard to distinguish exactly what a Staffordshire Bull Terrier is. The coat is very easy to manage, and in fact you should avoid the temptation to manage it, as it is naturally short and the whiskers should remain as they \u201ccome with\u201d the dog. It is important to properly train a Staffordshire Bull Terrier from a young age, ensuring that it gets strict rules and boundaries placed on it while still giving it an opportunity to socialize and grow naturally. You must establish yourself as the pack leader and set boundaries as early as possible to ensure that your pup grows into the best and friendliest dog possible.

In the miniature Schnauzer, you get a dog that belongs to the toy group. In the Giant Schnauzer, you get just that \u2013 a giant. But for many people, they feel like Goldilocks when they decide that the Standard Schnauzer is just right for them. It was certainly right for the painter Rembrandt, who frequently included the Standard Schnauzer in his paintings. But what does that mean for you? Does this English terrier lookalike really bring something unique to the table, or is it simply an also-ran in its own little group of Schnauzers? After all, it might not even be your favorite breed named a \u201cSchnauzer\u201d! Upon closer examination, we\u2019re sure that you\u2019ll find plenty to enjoy about this active, sporty breed that has its roots in obedience, loyalty, athleticism, and even guardianship. For many people, the Standard has become the gold standard in Schnauzers. For many people, the Standard has become the gold standard in Schnauzers. Although the Standard Schnauzer looks like a terrier, it doesn\u2019t quite belong in that group. Its origins aren\u2019t in England, where you\u2019ll find many terriers. Instead, the Standard Schnauzer hail from Germany \u2013 hence the funky name \u2013 and have since risen to prominence. A Standard Schnauzer even won the Westminster Dog Show in 1997, taking home \u201cBest in Show.\u201d Since the Standard Schnauzer comes from Germany, it bears its origins in that landscape. Even in the Middle Ages, dogs like the Standard Schnauzer were not very difficult to find, especially if you were walking around northern Europe. That doesn\u2019t mean the Standard Schnauzer existed back then as it does today, but it\u2019s certainly not a breed that\u2019s particularly new to the world of dog breeding. In fact, the first Standard Schnauzers actually went to dog shows in the 19th century. Standard Schnauzers actually may bear some pedigree in Pinschers \u2013 the words Pinscher and Schnauzer, for example, can actually be considered synonyms in some cases, or at least have in the past. This, of course, reflects the pure German pedigree of the Standard Schnauzer, and is actually pedigree to the other Schnauzers (the Miniature and Giant Schnauzers). So when you\u2019re talking about older Schnauzers, you\u2019re talking about the Standard. As was stated, Standard Schnauzers had relatively close ancestors around Germany in the Middle Ages, when dog breeds of this type were not uncommon. Using dogs for guardianship as well as other sporty purposes, the Standard Schnauzer developed out of the need for a real working dog \u2013 hence, the Standard Schnauzer is not exactly a Miniature in temperament or demeanor. The Standard Schnauzer enjoys a good hunk of meat like any dog, but you\u2019ll want to present it with an overall balanced meal on a regular basis in order to ensure proper nutrition. Since these dogs are capable of a lot of exercise, you might be surprised at how much food they can actually eat. Make sure regular exercise is part of the overall nutrition and health regimen. The Standard Schnauzer is considered easy to raise, so you shouldn\u2019t have many problems even if you\u2019re new to dogs. Keep in mind that despite their small stature relative to other breeds in their class, Standard Schnauzers can still have strong guardian instincts which are a throwback to its guardianship duties in Germany over the years. Today, the breed can be trained to be friendly, but your dog should be raised properly and should not be given overly excessive negative reinforcement for mistakes. It should be noted that the Standard Schnauzer is considered easy to raise, so you shouldn\u2019t have many problems even if you\u2019re new to dogs. Expect a weight of around 30-40 pounds, varying depending on gender. This is relatively small for a \u201cmedium-sized\u201d dog, but the Standard Schnauzer is not a perfect \u201cmiddle ground\u201d type of dog simply because there are larger and smaller versions of it. Feed it accordingly, making sure that you also remember that the Standard Schnauzer does love a good challenge and a good amount of exercise. Standard Schnauzers are considered easy to get along with and easy to train, so they make good companions if you simply want a good family dog without a lot of trouble along the way. They do have relatively strong guardian instincts, so be sure that you are very aware of your own Standard Schnauzer\u2019s need to protect you and your family and that these behaviors are under control. Of course, if you do want a dog that will be alert to potential intruders but don\u2019t want a massive dog, a Standard Schnauzers can be a perfect fit. The Standard Schnauzer comes with a good benefit: it\u2019s considered one of the healthier breeds out there, with very few Standard Schnauzers experiencing significant health issues in its lifetime. This is good if you want to keep trips to the veterinarian to a minimum. Around 13 to 16 years for a dog of this size, though you can expect even longer if you have a healthy dog on your hands. Don\u2019t worry so much about exercise \u2013 which should be regular, of course \u2013 but about mental challenges. The Standard Schnauzer can handle plenty of tasks and needs to avoid boredom and should be good and tired after working out if you want to really give them a full day\u2019s experience. Standard Schnauzers are considered easy to get along with and easy to train. According to the American Kennel Club, the Standard Schnauzer is a sturdy breed. To show this dog, you\u2019ll want to make sure to adhere to tight coat requirements. The coat is important on the Standard because it doesn\u2019t have a lot of variance across the breed \u2013 that is, if you\u2019re looking to show your Standard Schnauzer.

In addition to its hunting abilities, this breed is also known for being one of the four breeds used in the development of the more common German Wirehaired Pointer. Widely regarded as the oldest of the German rough-haired pointing breeds, the Stichelhaar comes from a cross between German sheepdogs and various rough-haired standing dogs. The breed was first recognized by the AKC in 1959 and the FCI in 1961, though the first breed standard wasn\u2019t published until 2001. The Stichelhaar is still considered to be fairly rare outside of its homeland in Germany. The Stichelhaar is the result of a crossing between German sheepdogs and various rough-haired standing dogs in Germany.

He can get along with other dogs if properly socialized, but he has a strong prey drive so be careful around pets. The Stichelhaar is fairly healthy with no serious congenital health problems. Even so, all dogs are prone to certain health problems and those to which the Stichelhaar breed may be prone include hip dysplasia, eye problems, ear infections, skin cancer, and von Willebrand\u2019s disease. The average lifespan for the Stichelhaar is thought to be about 12 to 14 years which is about average for a breed of its size. This breed is generally healthy but feeding him a high-quality diet will help to maximize his lifespan. The Stichelhaar is an active breed that requires a great deal of exercise.

The coat is short to medium in length with longer fur on the chest and the backs of the legs, in some cases. This breed is largely brown in color with white, mixed, or chestnut coloring. The coat naturally repels dirt and water, so frequent grooming is not needed, though the feet and ears should be checked after hunting. The average litter size for the Stichelhaar is fairly large, between 6 and 9 puppies. Because the breed grows to over 50 pounds at maturity, it technically classifies as a large-breed dog, so puppies should be given a large-breed puppy formula to prevent them from growing too quickly.

These dogs have survived throughout the ages, despite a difficult past, and are making a comeback as a loyal, family-friendly breed. Sussex Spaniels are known for their long, flowing coats and soft, furry ears as well as their loving disposition. If you are looking for a calm, friendly breed that is great with kids and has a noble appearance, look no further than the Sussex Spaniel. The development of the Sussex Spaniel began in 1795 when Mr. Fuller of Rosehill Park in East Sussex, England set out to breed gun dogs that were especially suited to the terrain near his home. The rough terrain and dense undergrowth of the East Sussex area required a short, stocky dog that could navigate the undergrowth and signal to the hunter to alert him on his quarry. The Sussex Spaniel was born from a crossing of various spaniel breeds including the now-extinct Norfolk Spaniel, the Field Spaniel, and English Springer Spaniel. What set the Sussex Spaniel apart from all of these breeds was its ability to bark when he cornered his prey. In 1884, the Sussex Spaniel became one of the first 10 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club. By the 1940s, however, it had lost most of its popularity and, during World War II, breeding was discouraged in favor of larger, working dogs. English breeder Joy Freer ignored this, however, and began breeding the Sussex Spaniel to save the breed from extinction. By 1947 only 10 Sussex Spaniels were registered with the UKC and as recently as 2004 the breed was still considered a Vulnerable Native Breed. Today, the breed continues to be fairly rare but it is more popular in the U.S. than in any other country, even its home in Britain. The Sussex Spaniel is descendant from various spaniel breeds including the now-extinct Norfolk Spaniel, the Field Spaniel, and English Springer Spaniel. Given that the Sussex Spaniel is a medium-sized hunting breed, it is best to use a dog food formula that is specialized for active dogs.

The Sussex Spaniel is a fast learner, but you do need to be calm and consistent in training this breed. These dogs respond to a firm pack leader and should be started with training and socialization early. Because the Sussex Spaniel is able to bark, you will need to focus on training him to respond to a \u201cHush\u201d command or teach him that one bark is sufficient. The Sussex Spaniel is considered a medium-sized breed, weighing between 35 and 45 lbs. at maturity. It is often compared to the Clumber Spaniel, a larger breed, which weighs between 55 and 85 lbs. The Sussex Spaniel is known for being a calm, easy going breed. These dogs love to spend time with people and they can be quite protective of their families. Even though the Sussex Spaniel is calm and docile by nature, he still has a clownish side to him \u2013 he has been known to play with great energy and enthusiasm. Because these dogs are so calm and friendly, they make wonderful family pets, especially for families with children. Sussex Spaniels are a social breed. In addition to enjoying time with people, they also tend to get along well with other dogs and even cats. These dogs do tend to bark at the doorbell or when strangers enter their property, but they are not aggressive toward people. Proper training and socialization will ensure that the dog gets along well with people and other pets. The Sussex Spaniel is generally fairly healthy but, due to its limited gene pool, the breed is prone to certain health problems. For example, hip dysplasia is a fairly common congenital condition in this breed but because of the breed\u2019s compact body, it is generally not debilitating. Perhaps the most common health condition seen in this breed is otitis externa, or outer ear infections. This is due to the floppy nature of the dog\u2019s ears which trap moisture. Some other conditions to which this breed is prone include pulmonary valve stenosis, patent ductus arteriosis, hypertrophy, intervertable disc disease, and various eye problems. The average life expectancy for the Sussex Spaniel is about 12 to 15 years. Because the Sussex Spaniel is a hunting breed, it requires a fair amount of daily exercise. Sussex Spaniels should be given a daily walk as well as plenty of outdoor play time. Lack of exercise for this breed can lead to the development of behavioral problems.

The Sussex Spaniel has a medium-long, flowing coat of soft reddish brown fur. The coat is thick and flat with some individuals exhibiting waves, though never curls. The ears and tail are covered in a thick, soft fur and the fur on the hindquarters and forequarters is slightly feathered. Due to the length and thickness of the Sussex Spaniel\u2019s coat, these dogs require regularly brushing and combing to prevent matting. The fur between the toes should also be trimmed along with the hair beneath the ears if ear infections are a problem.

The J\u00e4mthund shares some of its history with the Swedish Lapphund, Finnish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder and the Norwegian Elkhound.

The Swedish Elkhound is a medium-sized breed that stands between 20.5 and 25.5 inches and weighs between 50 and 65 pounds. Because the Swedish Elkhound was bred to hunt elk and other large game it can be somewhat independent and a little bit stubborn by nature. These dogs also tend to be dominant toward other dogs and they have a fairly high prey drive so they should be supervised around cats and other household pets. In the home, however, the Swedish Elkhound is calm and affectionate with family and they can do well with children due to their natural protective tendencies. This breed is eager to please but they do need a strong authority figure to create a \u201cpack\u201d mentality at home. The Moosehound also needs plenty of mental stimulation in addition to physical exercise to curb problem behaviors. As an ancient breed, the Swedish Elkhound is fairly health and hardy. Still, all dogs are prone to developing certain health conditions. Some of the conditions known to affect the Swedish Elkhound include hip dysplasia, skin allergies, elbow dysplasia, liver disease, and hearing problems.

This breed is able to achieve speeds up to 60 km/h and its hunting abilities are much more versatile than the average sighthound. The Taigan Dog is a type of sighthound that can achieve speeds up to 60 km/h. The origins of the Taigan Dog can be traced back to the indigenous people of Krgyzstan who used them for their hunting and guarding skills. Legend has it that the Taigan is descended from the mythical bird dog, hatching from an egg that was stolen from the next of the highland vulture known as Kumai. The puppy grew to become the savior of the indigenous people, rescuing them from the terror of the local wolves. The Taigan was thus declared a national treasure. The exact origins of the Taigan Dog are unknown but it may share some of its heritage with other sighthound breeds like the Azawakh, Saluki, Afghan Hound, and the Sloughi.

Other people want something more from their dog. They\u2019re seeking a pet that looks like a tamed wolf. Different strokes, as they say! For those dog owners on the hunt for a big boy who looks like he could star in a White Fang remake, may we humbly recommend the Tamaskan. The Tamaskan may look like a wolf, but this breed is all dog. In fact, this pooch was selectively bred by dog breeders in order to create this wolf-like of appearance and they are truly stunning. Tamaskan dogs are both a new and rare breed but they are extremely intelligent and highly versatile in terms of dog sports and working ability. This breed is best for experienced dog owners who have the time and the ability to provide plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. This isn\u2019t a pet for first time dog owners. These pups require work, attention, and care. Yet, the results are clearly worth it for veteran dog owners. So, is the Tamaskan the right doggo to bring into your home? Fortunately, you\u2019ve come to the right place to find out. Keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away. Everything that needs to be known about owning a Tamaskan will be revealed below. The Tamaskan may look like a wolf, but this breed is all dog. The Tamaskan dog is a fairly new breed, having only been developed in the 1980s. The origins of the breed can be traced back to a group of five Husky-type dogs that were imported into the United States during the 1980s. These dogs were crossed with Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and German Shepherds to create new breed that would resemble wolf in its appearance, while displaying the obedience and intelligence that are characteristic of domesticated dogs. The breed was then exported to Finland for additional development. The first result was the Utonagan dog, but some believe that further crossing of this breed with the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is what made the Tamaskan dog as we know it today. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t be certain of this pup\u2019s specific history because like all designer dogs, there simply wasn\u2019t much documented.  The purpose for creating this dog breed was to develop a domestic dog that had a wild appearance and strong working ability. It\u2019s safe to say that the breeders achieved this goal with the Tamaskan. This dog delivers as advertised. The first litter of Tamaskan puppies came to the United States in 2005 and there are now several Tamaskan breeders across the U.S. The Tamaskan dog was selectively bred from Husky-type dogs that were imported into the USA during the 1980s. The breed was developed with influence from Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes ,German Shepherd and even a little bit of Czechoslovakian Wolfdog. While most of these breeds were selected primarily for their wolf-like appearance, the lupine look is not the only goal breeders wanted to achieve with the Tamaskan. Owing to its parents, these hybrids are intelligent, capable, brave, and loyal to their owners. This particular combination of traits (and breeds in their family tree) makes the Tamaskan ideally suited as a companion, working dog, or a family pet. It takes a special animal that can do everything the Tamaskan offers and this pup qualifies as a special achievement in designer dog breeding.  Because the Tamaskan dog is such a high-energy working breed, these dogs need a commercial dog food diet that is dense in both nutrients and calories. So, choose a high-quality commercial dog food diet for the Tamaskan and consider an active or working breed formula for the best results. Additionally, you should choose kibble that\u2019s suitable for your pet\u2019s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Your pup\u2019s needs will change as he ages just like you, so it\u2019s important to find a food that is well suited to your dog\u2019s specific stage of life. If you are ever concerned about establishing or altering your dog\u2019s diet, it\u2019s always wise to consult with your veterinarian. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guides, they are still guidelines and not gospel. All dogs are different and only your vet is qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch. So always check in with your vet before making any changes to what you put in your dog\u2019s bowl at feeding time. Because Tamaskans are a highly intelligent breed, they generally respond well to training. Because the Tamaskan dog is a highly intelligent breed these dogs generally respond well to training. Early socialization and training is essential for this breed to help keep its energy under control. These dogs sometimes develop a stubborn streak so you will need to maintain a firm and consistent hand in training, providing the dog with strong leadership. Newbie dog owners or first-time dog owners might find these impressive dogs too much work, so it\u2019s best not to consider this breed if you don\u2019t have previous training and ownership experience. Patience and persistence will be vital to successfully training a Tamaskan and not all dog owners are up to the task. It isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s worth it.  With a smart and energetic dog like the Tamaskan, it\u2019s best to have a confident approach and rely on positive reinforcement methods. Be consistent and assert yourself as the pack leader, but still use treats and praise as a form of motivation, rather than being harsh or cruel to your new pet. Not only that aversive training is inhumane, but it is also completely ineffective. You\u2019ll never get the results you seek by being overly negative while training your pup. It takes a gentle, yet firm hand to properly train a Tamaskan and that\u2019s why so few dog owners are truly up to the task.  In addition to basic obedience, housebreaking, and early socialization, you can work with the Tamaskan on more complex learning tasks. This breed does well as a working breed and he excels in various dog sports including obedience, agility, and field trials.

You won\u2019t ever be surprised when one of these dogs walks into a room. They have quite an imposing presence.  It\u2019s part of the appeal. Despite its wild appearance, the Tamaskan dog is actually quite a gentle breed. Sweet and affectionate, they will do well as family pets or companions to singles. They get very attached to their owner and form a very strong bond to their family. Tamaskans won\u2019t tolerate being left alone for long periods of time. They are prone to developing separation anxiety. In addition to being very devoted to their closest humans, these dogs are also very friendly and generally have an extroverted personality. All things considered, it\u2019s safe to say that this breed likes to be around people and they tend to get along well with children. Don\u2019t forget that these dogs are intelligent and active. As a result, they do require a good deal of exercise as well as mental stimulation to prevent boredom (which can lead to the development of problem behaviors). They need owners who can keep up with their physical and mental needs to thrive. As a working dog breed, they tend to be at their best when they have a task, so consider training them for one of the popular dog sports as an alternative. Something like agility, canine freestyle, pulling, mushing, or flyball. There are plenty of fun activities your Tamaskan could excel at! It\u2019s all up to you. Because the Tamaskan is a fairly new breed there is limited information regarding congenital health problems. However, this hybrid was developed from several breeds that are known for good health. So you can expect the Tamaskan dog to be fairly healthy as well. There are, however, a few conditions to which this breed may be prone including cryptorchidism, epilepsy, hip dysplasia, and degenerative myelopathy. As always, it\u2019s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a vet (especially as the dog ages) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. Tamaskan dogs have a fairly long lifespan compared to other dogs this size. The average life expectancy for the breed is 14 to 15 years.

The coat is what gives the breed its wolf-like appearance. These dogs resemble grey Timber Wolves, having a multicolored coat made up of various shades of gray and brown as well as black and white. The Tamaskan dog\u2019s coat is double and thick, the tail bushy and straight. This breed exhibits three main colorations: Red Grey, Wolf Grey, and Black Grey. When it comes to grooming, the Tamaskan is not high-maintenance. A weekly brush will be all it takes to keep their lupine-like fur looking its best. However, these dogs will go through moulting season twice a year and will shed more during this period. To make it more manageable for you and your pet, you\u2019ll have to brush them every day during this period. Trust us, the extra effort is worth it.

Early specimens of the breed were known as Miniature Fox Terriers and they were brought to Australia via ship during the 19th century, accompanying the first European settlers. These small terriers were given the name Tenterfield Terrier in reference to Tenterfield, a town in New South Wales were a man name George Woolnough became known for his love for the breed.

Everyone has their favorite type. Some like toy dogs, others like show dogs, a few seek working dogs, etc. But there are some folks out there for whom only a herder dog will do.  Smart, highly trainable and protective, the Texas Heeler is a herder through and through. This designer dog will impress you with his wit and personality, both of which have made him a popular choice for many in Texas and even outside his native state. The lovely appearance is just an added bonus. It\u2019s tough to feel indifferent to those wiggly butts and one of a kind looks. These pups are absolutely adorable. That\u2019s just a fact.  Also known as the Queensland Heeler or the Blue Heeler, the Texas Heeler is a hybrid breed resulting from the crossing of an Australian Cattle Dog and an Australian Shepherd Dog (In other words, the Texas Heeler combines two of the finest herders into one!). The Texas Heeler is an active and intelligent breed that exhibits a combination of the characteristics of both parent breeds. Because the Heeler is a hybrid, different litters may produce dogs with different physical and temperamental characteristics. Yet, for the most part, the Texas Heeler is a friendly dog and an excellent herder. You can\u2019t always predict what to expect from a hybrid dog, but those two qualities are practically guaranteed to be in this pup\u2019s personality.  Texas Heeler is a perfect pet for families with older children, active owners, or people who live on a farm and want a reliable companion and working dog in one breed. However, while the unique ancestry of this hybrid makes him an ideal choice for many prospective pet owners, there are many other options who would also be a quality match. Is this hybrid truly the right dog for you? Fortunately, you\u2019ve come to the right place to find out. Keep your eyes glued to this page a scroll on to learn everything that there is to know about the Texas Heeler and whether or not the pooch will fit into your lifestyle. An excellent watch and herding dog, the Texas Heeler is a hybrid breed resulting from the crossing an Australian Cattle Dog and Australian Shepherd Dog. Crossbreeding dogs is a process that has been practiced for hundreds (if not thousands) of years Yet, despite that long history, it is difficult to tell when the Texas Heeler breed actually originated. Sadly, there just isn\u2019t much documented history available about this or any other hybrid pooch. Most people count the moment when the breed transitioned from unplanned crossbreeding to intentional development of a new hybrid breed as the beginning of any hybrid dog\u2019s history. However, there\u2019s no information about when this happened for the Australian Cattle Dog and an Australian Shepherd Dog mix. It is known that the Texas Heeler is most commonly found in Texas (obviously), but no one breeder or kennel has been officially credited with the creation or development of the breed. Sadly, this is one of the great canine mysteries. However, it is believed that Lucy Guynes may have been responsible for registering the first Texas Heeler in 1970. Unfortunately, that guess is the closest thing that we have to a history of this beloved pooch.  After decades of crossbreeding, this intelligent and active designer dog is one of the more popular mixes. While predominantly in demand in his home state, the Texas Heeler is quickly stealing hearts all across the country. And with good reason too! The unique mix of those two purebreds results in a dog that\u2019s suited for the role of pet and of working dog. Beyond that, this pup tends to excel at doggie sports, too. These are active dogs who love to show off their physical prowess.   As you\u2019ve hopefully gathered by now, the Texas Heeler is not a purebred dog. It is a hybrid of the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd Dog. He is a 50/50 cross of these two breeds. This is also known as a first generation hybrid or F1 mix. First generation crossbreeds such as the Texas Heeler are the most common ones, but they can significantly vary in looks and behavior. With both of their parents being a different breed, the puppies can end up favoring either one of them. They will often look and behave more like one of their parent breeds than the other. However, which one of the parents will be favoured in each puppy and how that will manifest is impossible to predict. Each F1 puppy is a surprise.  There are also Texas Heelers with a greater percentage of one breed in the mix. This is a result of multigenerational breeding, a fairly common practice with designer dogs that have been around for decades. Breeders cross a Texas Heeler with an unrelated Australian Cattle Dog or an Australian Shepherd Dog, depending on whose traits they want to make more prominent. Also, some breeders are developing second generation Texas Heelers (F2) which are the result of crossing two Texas Heelers. So, if you would like a more predictable Texas Heeler puppy, there are options beyond rolling the dice with an F1 hybrid.  To thrive and stay healthy, every dog needs a well-balanced diet that meets their unique dietary needs. The Texas Heeler is a herding breed which means that it has a great deal of energy. To support all that energy, your dog will need calorie-dense, nutritious meals that will fuel them throughout the day. For most dogs, Texas Heeler included, high-quality dry food for dogs is the best match. This being the case, it is recommended that you feed your Texas Heeler a dog food formulated especially for active breeds. Usually, this will ensure that your dog\u2019s energy needs are met. To boot, their kibble should also be appropriate for their size (medium breeds), as well as their age (puppy, adult, or senior). Another important aspect of nutrition is making sure not to overfeed your dog. The Texas Heeler will need quality food, but not an excess amount of it. Stick to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations on serving sizes to avoid obesity. As a rule of thumb, these dogs usually don\u2019t need more than 3 cups of premium kibble a day. If you are ever concerned about your dog\u2019s diet, it is always a wise idea to consult with your veterinarian. While dog food manufacturers and the internet provide valuable feeding guidelines, they are still just guidelines. All dogs are different and your personal pooch may have different dietary needs than a typical Texas Heeler. Always consult with your vet before making any big changes to your dog\u2019s diet. Only they will be able to identify the specific dietary needs of your pup. Identifying these sorts of things are the reason why why you have vet, after all. Never be afraid to ask them! The Texas Heeler is an active and intelligent breed that typically responds well to training. The Texas Heeler is an active and intelligent breed that typically responds well to training. These dogs love having a job to do so they are eager to learn new tricks and commands. This breed was developed for herding so they have strong herding instincts but they can also be trained for other dog sports including agility and flyball. As always, it\u2019s important to focus on training rooted in positive reinforcement and encouragement. Anything less verges too close to abuse to qualify as training. Early socialization is also recommended with this breed to get them used to being around other dogs and pets. For the most part, these dogs are good with children, but obviously early socialization is also important here as well. The Texas Heeler is a medium sized breed that generally stands between 17 and 22 inches tall at maturity. These dogs typically weigh between 25 and 50 pounds when they are full grown. As these dogs take the best features from their two parent breeds, they tend to be powerfully built, tall, and lean. So, even though they can go to 50 lbs and up, they won\u2019t display many tendencies towards obesity or rapid weight gain \u2013 they are athletic, energetic, and muscular. Nevertheless, maintaining that balanced weight and build will require plenty of exercise and a healthy, balanced diet.  The Texas Heeler is an energetic and hard-working breed with natural herding instincts. These dogs can be affectionate toward their owners but they can also be somewhat aloof around strangers unless properly socialized from a young age.  Early socialization is always so important if you want to ensure that your pup is friendly. Texas Heelers generally get along well with children, but they may not be great with other dogs and household pets. So keep that in mind if you are considering bringing a Texas Heeler into a home that is already filled with furbabies. This breed makes a good watchdog, though they do not tend to bark unless there is an intruder or a stranger nearby. As far as their behavior is considered, you will quickly notice that Texas Heelers have ample amounts of energy. With those natural herding instincts, they will love to run around and spend all that pent up energy inside them. This means that regular walks and playtime in the park will be a must. Texas Heelers \u2013 when raised properly \u2013 can be quite playful and friendly with other dogs of the same character. Don\u2019t hesitate to let them run about in the park in friendly play with other dogs \u2013 with your supervision, of course. Not at all surprisingly, Texas Heelers can also be great as family pets. With some friendly and loving attitude from an early age, you can ensure that your four legged friend will grow up to be as affectionate and caring as a pupper can be. And this means that they will develop that iconic protective attitude that only puppers can have. They are great around kids too \u2013 always teasing for play and standing close watch over the youngest ones. All that is needed is some patience and early relationship building. The Texas Heeler is a hybrid breed and, as a result, it may be less prone to developing hereditary conditions than either of the parent breeds. For the most part, Texas Heelers are a hardy and healthy breed but they may be prone to developing certain health problems. Some of the health problems to which this breed is prone include hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), cataracts, and epilepsy. Dogs with merle coloring may also be at risk for deafness. It\u2019s important to schedule regular check ups with a vet (especially as they get older) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. The average lifespan of the Texas Heeler breed is about 12 to 15 years. This is one of those standard life spans amongst dogs that makes them good as companions for a big chunk of your life. Sadly, out of all Heeler breeds, Texas Heeler displays the most potential health problems if not cared for properly. These potential issues could affect that lifespan, but if you show good care and follow all the rules \u2013 there is no reason whatsoever why your beloved friend could not surpass that 15 year mark. The Texas Heeler is an active breed that was born to herd cattle. This being the case, they have fairly high requirements for daily exercise. In addition to a daily 30 minute walk, this breed would appreciate some time to run and play outside. Trips to the dog park or to an off leash area where your dog can run freely will help exert his energy. This is not a dog who will want to be cooped up in an apartment or spend his days lounging in your lap. Texas Heelers need plenty of activity every day in order to be their best selves.If you happen to neglect a Heeler\u2019s need for exercise, negative effects might show up sooner than expected. If not given the chance to release some steam, a Texas Heeler might invent his own way of doing it. This can result in some torn up furniture, chewed up table legs and cables, or torn up newspapers. Such behavior can be especially observed amongst puppies. What is more, if a Heeler is totally neglected and their needs are not met, obesity might occur in the long run. Mistreated, cooped up, and overfed puppers can grow overweight and moving will become a difficulty. What ensues then is apathy and lethargy, and a host of health problems. Make a daily routine early on and stick to it. Daily exercise will not benefit your Texas Heeler only \u2013 it will be good for you as well! The Texas Heeler is an energetic and hard-working breed with natural herding instincts. Because the Texas Heeler is a hybrid and not a purebred dog, it is not recognized by the American Kennel Association. It is, however, recognized by the Animal Research Foundation (ARF), Dog Registry of America (DRA) and the American Canine Hybrid Club (ACHC). As a part of these associations, this breed received a somewhat standardized set of common traits observed, such as coat colors, physical and behavioral traits, common patterns, and other similar features. The coat of a Texas Heeler may vary in appearance depending on breeding. These dogs have been shown to have either short to medium-length coats (about 1 to 3 inches long) of smooth fur in a variety of colors. The most common colors for this breed are black, blue merle, or blue ticked with either white or tan trim. The ears of this breed are generally pricked, but they may fold over in some specimens. Texas Heelers can have long tails but most are born with bobbed tails. Texas Heeler puppies should be started with training and socialization from a young age. This will help to prevent them from being aloof or nervous around strangers and it will also help you to control their energy levels. Texas Heeler puppies are often born with bobbed tails, though long tails are possible. Puppies are born with drop ears that often become pricked, though some of them will always fold over.", "facts": " not applicable Families with children, active singles, houses with yards, farms/rural areas, watchdog Active, energetic, friendly, alert", "tags": "agility, Australian Cattle Dog, Blue Heeler, bob tails, breed spot light, flyball, herding dog, hybrid dog, merle, pricked ears, Queensland Heeler, Texas Heeler, watchdog, "}, "thai ridgeback": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/thai-ridgeback/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thai-ridgeback-1.jpg", "name": "Thai Ridgeback", "type": "dog", "text": "Few people in the United States have heard of the Thai Ridgeback, let alone met one in person.

With proper socialization and training, the Thai Ridgeback can make a wonderful family pet. Originating in Thailand, the Thai Ridgeback is an ancient breed without documentation of its ancestry. They were bred to be watchdogs as well as pull carts and eradicate rats, wild boar and cobras. Today, they provide protection for active families with older children. There are no records documenting the development of the Thai Ridgeback. It is believed that this is a primitive breed that has been speculated to date back to the Middle Ages. Some believe that there is some relation to the Funan Ridgeback Dog, Hottentot Dog, Rhodesian Ridgeback and Phu Quoc Ridgeback. This is currently being investigated scientifically through studies of this breed\u2019s DNA. An athletic and high-energy dog, the Thai Ridgeback needs to be fed a high-quality diet of dry kibble. The food should be formulated for the particular dog\u2019s activity level. Dry food is essential to this breed\u2019s oral health as wet foods can cause caries, gum infections and bad breath. An independent breed, the Thai Ridgeback requires an experienced owner who can assert himself to be the leader of the family.

Manhandling and harsh discipline is counter-productive to training this breed. The Thai Ridgeback responds well to positive training methods and learns rather quickly when delectable treats are involved. Repetitive training sessions will prove to be worth the time. One of the things that the Thai Ridgeback was bred to do was to pull carts in Thailand. Nowadays, he is well-suited for draft trials, obedience and agility. Of course, this breed can be an incredible watchdog. The Thai Ridgeback usually weighs between 51 and 75 pounds and stands between 20 and 22 inches tall at the shoulders.

Thai Ridgebacks are pretty healthy dogs. The breed is seeing incidences of hip dysplasia which may or may not be environmentally caused. Thai Ridgebacks are also predisposed to having dermoid sinus. On average, the Thai Ridgeback lives to be between 10 and 12 years old. Thai Ridgebacks were bred to work and they require a lot of exercise. Long walks or jogs are great but this breed also needs room to stretch out and run. He can tolerate living in condos or apartment buildings provided there is a dog park nearby that he can use. Without enough exercise, the Thai Ridgeback can become incredibly destructive and disruptive. Although not a barker, the dog will become frustrated and try to communicate his need for activity vocally. He will also tear up furniture and chew whatever he can get his teeth on if he is bored. Exercise is essential to living peacefully with this breed. A breed that is naturally protective of his family, the Thai Ridgeback is a diligent and brave watchdog. The AKC writes: \u201cThe Thai Ridgeback is being recorded in the AKC Foundation Stock Service \u2013 The AKC provides this service to allow purebred breeds to continue to develop while providing them with the security of a reliable and reputable avenue to maintain their records. FSS breeds are not eligible for AKC registration.\u201d The Thai Ridgeback has not been recognized by the AKC at this time. Thai Ridgebacks have a smooth coat. The acceptable colors are black, gray, brindle, red, white and fawn. This breed does not require a lot of grooming. A thorough brushing each week will keep the Thai Ridgeback looking sleek. When dirty or malodorous, the dog should be bathed. Thai Ridgeback puppies require early socialization to ensure that they will be accepting to strangers and other animals.

Read on to learn more about him. A wonderful watch and guard dog, the Tibetan Mastiff loves his people, making him an all-around fantastic family dog. Originating in Tibet (hence the name), the Tibetan Mastiff came into being thousands of years ago. This breed was used to protect Tibetan monasteries, and guard villages and livestock from wolves, leopards and other predators. They lived comfortably in the Himalayan Mountains, thanks to their thick, heavy coat. This breed was kept hidden from most of the world, as Westerners weren\u2019t allowed to visit Tibet. The first English recording of the breed is from 1828, when King George IV gifted a \u201cThibet Mastiff or Watch Dog\u201d to the London Zoo. The breed\u2019s appearance in North America was thanks to the Dalai Lama, who gave a pair to President Eisenhower in the late 1950s. Sadly, the Tibetan Mastiff almost became extinct when communist Chinese claimed control of Tibet. During this time, it was ordered that dogs be beaten to death by their owners, or else their owners would be beaten to death for disobeying. As a result, almost all native Tibetan breeds were lost. Fortunately, a few survived and were bred in secret. And now, across the world, fanciers of this noble breed are working to strengthen their numbers.  The Tibetan Mastiff may have been the foundation from which most large working breeds (mastiffs and mountain dogs) included can trace their roots back to. Because this is an ancient breed, there are no records of this breed\u2019s heritage. It is believed that Tibetan Mastiff has ancestral ties to dogs that resided in the Himalayan Mountains and surrounding valley regions thousands of years ago. This is a big dog, so expect to feed your dog a lot of food \u2013 about 4 to 6 cups of a high-quality dog food a daily. Portion sizes will depend on how active your dog is. You\u2019ll want to break up his meal times into several feeding to avoid bloat, which occurs if your dog eats his food too quickly.

This large, dominant breed will assume that he is the leader of the house\u2026 until you teach him otherwise. It will take a lot of time, consistency and patience to establish your leadership, but it will all be worth it in the end. Start early to see the results and train with a firm hard. Don\u2019t use harsh training techniques, as your Tibetan Mastiff will not respect your authority. You need a lot of space to keep a Tibetan Mastiff.

You\u2019ll find that your dog will keep an eye on strangers in the home, even if they aren\u2019t a threat. To his family, you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a more devoted and loving dog.

They also don\u2019t like being tugged or poked \u2013 that could earn children a warning nip. Start the socialization process as soon as possible. The Tibetan Mastiff likes other animals, as long as they are raised alongside them. Because this is a dominant breed, male Tibetan Mastiffs will be aggressive toward other male dogs. This is why training is a must. You must teach them acceptable dog manners and how they should greet and interact with other dogs and friendly people. For such a large breed, the Tibetan Mastiff has a long lifespan and few health issues. Health concerns that can be seen in this breed include hip dysplasia, skin problems, hypertrophic neuropathy and thyroid disease.  The Tibetan Mastiff has an average lifespan of 12 to 15 years. As puppies, the Tibetan Mastiff doesn\u2019t slow down \u2013 but not to worry, they will mellow with age. He needs a few walks a day, but don\u2019t expect him to run around in the yard on his own. You\u2019d much rather lounge in a favorite shady spot. This breed needs more room than an apartment or condo can offer \u2013 he needs a yard so he can spend most his time outdoors. Not only does this give them space to move about, but it also allows them to show off their skills as watch and guard dogs. Leaving them inside could lead to destructive behavior.

They possess a solemn but kind expression, with an immense double coat it can be black, brown and blue/grey, with or without tan markings, and various shades of gold. Although seen in shows in the United States today, they may not enjoy participating in organized activities such as obedience or agility due to their highly independent natures.\u201d The AKC first recognized this breed in 2006. The Tibetan Mastiff has a lot of fur, thanks to his thick double coat made up of a soft and wooly undercoat and a long, coarse topcoat. His fur is always straight, and he boasts a thick mane at the neck and shoulder. As for coat colors, you\u2019ll find them in black, brown, gold or blue. They can have tan markings above the eyes, on the side of the muzzle, on the throat, forelegs, rear legs or breeches, while others have white markings on the chest and feet.

A great friend for seniors and those who live in smaller quarters, the Tibetan Spaniel can be aloof with strangers, but will warm up once he gets to know them. The Tibetan Spaniel is one of three breeds native to Tibet. This breed kept watch over Tibetan monasteries, were called \u201clion dogs\u201d and were regarded as a symbol of Buddha. Although the age of the breed is unknown, evidence and historical artifacts have been found that speculate the Tibbie could be over 1000 years old. This breed was valued and given to royal families and dignitaries as gifts. Because of the age of the Tibetan Spaniel, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact pedigree of this breed. However, it is speculated that it is related to the Pekingese and Japanese Chin. Tibetan Spaniels can thrive on a number of different diets, from dry kibble to raw diets. Because every dog is different, you may need to experiment with what diet works best for your dog. The Tibbie isn\u2019t an overly active dog, so be sure not to overfeed him, as it could cause obesity. If you\u2019ve got a lot of attention to give, the Tibetan Spaniel is the dog for you.

This breed loves its family but is wary of strangers. Even with its small size, the Tibbie is good with small children and will keep a watchful eye on their activities. Because of their small size, the Tibetan Spaniel can be carried around in a bag or purse. That being said, you must not over-coddle them, as it leads to the dog becoming high-strung. Give your dog enough independence and make sure he gets out of the purse and onto a leash for regular walks. This will allow him to socialize with people and dogs, so he\u2019ll learn proper doggy manners. And because of his small size, please ask people to greet him on his level, as this will make him feel most comfortable. Like we mentioned before, the Tibetan Spaniel craves attention. If left alone too long, Separation Anxiety can result. This breed does best with people who can stay at home, not those who work long hours. If left alone too long, you can expect your belongings to become chew toys and annoyed neighbors driven to distraction with constant barking. The Tibetan Spaniel is a generally healthy breed. However, this dog may suffer from the following conditions: progressive retinal atrophy, cherry eye, patellar luxation, allergies, and portosystemic shunt (a liver condition). The Tibetan Spaniel has an average lifespan of 12 to 15 years. Because of his size, Tibetan Spaniels can live pretty much anywhere. They do as well in an apartment as they would in a large estate.

They are low to the ground, with a body slightly longer than tall. Popular primarily as companion dogs in their native Tibet, \u201cTibbies\u201d are also now found in the conformation, obedience and agility rings in the United States.\u201d The AKC first recognized this breed in 1983. Sporting a silky double coat, the Tibbie\u2019s fur is long at the ears, tail, back of the forelegs and buttocks, and smooth on his face and front of the legs. You can expect long hair covering the rest of his body and a mane around the neck called a shawl. The coat comes in many colors and patterns. The Tibetan Spaniel shed lightly year round. To keep his coat free from tangles and matts, you should brush your Tibetan Spaniel two to three times per week. As with most dogs, Tibetan Spaniels need early socialization. Expose your dog to as different people, sights, sounds, and experiences as possible while he is young.

These compact canines have been selectively bred for the role of companionship for centuries, and they truly excel as family pets. Sweet, lively, and exceptionally affectionate with their owners, Tibetan Terriers will fit in most families.

In fact, these shaggy pooches are more o the mellow and easy-going side of the spectrum. They provide the adorable aesthetics of a terrier with none of the personality drawbacks.

Not sure if the Tibetan Terrier is the right dog for your own family? Read on to learn more about them before you decide. We will provide everything that you could possibly want to know about the Tibetan Terrier. All you need to do is keep your eyes glued to this page. All will be revealed!  The Tibetan Terrier is an intelligent and mischievous dog that will be dedicated to its family. Bred and raised in Tibetan monasteries by Buddhist monks (aka \u2018lamas\u2019) almost 2,000 years ago. Thatnks to these spiritual beginnings, this breed is also known as the \u201cHoly Dogs of Tibet.\u201d While the Tibetan Terrier originated in the lamaseries of this historical region, it wasn\u2019t for long that they remained companions to the monks alone. The shaggy and friendly dogs were seen as good luck charms of sorts, and were popular with nomads and herdsmen, as the alert little pups would bark to alert their owners if anything\u2019s amiss. Due to their status, Tibetan Terriers were only gifted and never sold. They were considered too special for anything less. The puppies of the breed could be given in return for services or as a sign of respect, especially to officials.  It\u2019s through this rich tradition of holy gifts that the Tibetan Terrier grew in stature to become one of the world\u2019s most popular breeds of dog. Dr. Agnes R. H. Greig, an English doctor, got a Tibetan Terrier puppy from a Tibetan nobleman whose wife she saved. This was a rare honour and the doctor was enamoured by the charming little dogs. So much so that she got a mate for her new pet and immediately started breeding them. This all happened in 1920s India, where the breed\u2019s standard was first created a decade later. From there, the rest is history. The British Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1937, and the American Kennel Club did the same in 1973. It\u2019s not often that the history of a dog breed is so widely known and fascinating. However, with a dog as legendary as the Tibetan Terrier, an incredible history and reputation proceeds them.  Recent DNA analysis has found that the Tibetan Terrier is descended from the most ancient dog breeds. As for the nitty gritty of how the breed actually came to be, the \u2018holy dog\u2019 remains a mystery, even millennia after its creation. Perhaps these were magical creatures delivered from a holy source to gift the world with a divine level of cuteness. Or perhaps they were the result of a crossbreeding of a few strays who found a home in a Buddhist Temple. We\u2019ll never know.  The Tibetan Terrier was recognized by the AKC in 1973. It has been a beloved show dog ever since. The Tibetan Terrier requires a quality diet that is going to provide the nutrition that it needs, whether it\u2019s commercial dog food or a homemade diet. The first ingredient should always be protein, not byproducts. As well, it should include vitamins and minerals, carbohydrates, and fatty acids. These standards are usually met by high-quality dry food for dogs, which offers complete nutrition in a convenient form. For a  Tibetan Terrier, choose kibble that suits their age (puppy, adult, senior) size, and activity levels.  As long as their diet is based on high-grade ingredients and offers all the nutrients they need, Tibetan Terriers won\u2019t need much food to thrive. For a dog of their size, most manufacturers recommend feeding about 2 cups of kibble, but the exact amount will vary. Stick to the feeding guide from the bag, as these dogs can become obese in no time- and that could influence their health. As always it\u2019s important to consult with a veterinarian before creating or changing any dog\u2019s diet. While pet websites and dog food manufacturers may provide useful feeding guidelines, they should always be treated as guidelines and not gospel. All dogs have different needs, after all. Only a vet who is familiar with your specific dog is qualified to access the dietary needs of your personal pup. So while you should absolutely do your research and find a healthy recommended diet like the one outlined above, make sure to check in with a vet before permanently committing to it. Gentle and loyal, the Tibetan Terrier makes a great watchdog and is willing to play around in the yard or just nap at your feet. Because it is so incredibly intelligent, Tibetan Terriers are an ideal breed for training. Just make sure you know what you\u2019re doing, as the dog may use its smarts to get the upper hand and train you instead! These pups are genuinely clever enough to pull off that switcheroo during training. There are a few things in mind when training this breed. Never use negative methods of training, as Tibetan Terriers will ignore you or rebel against the negative methods of training without modifying its behavior (and they are right to do so given that these techniques are closer to abuse than training). You should use positive methods of training, such as treats, affection and play in order to teach obedience. For training to be successful, you\u2019ll also have to be completely consistent throughout the process. Make sure that your Tibetan Terrier knows what it has to do in order to be rewarded, and don\u2019t let your dog sucker you into giving it a reward without doing the work. They will attempt that tricky behaviour. When you keep your behavior consistent and give your dog achievable objectives every day, your Tibetan Terrier will master the finer points of training. Persistence and patience are to of the most important qualities that any dog trainer can have. Putting in the work and effort will pay off in a big way given that properly trained Tibetan Terriers are amongst the most loving and adorable in the world. Both male and female Tibetan Terriers weigh 18 to 30 pounds. The Tibetan Terrier is a companion dog, which means it thrives on the presence of people. If you leave this dog alone for too long, it will become unhappy, which can lead to behavioral problems. These pups thrive on being social. They can get up to trouble when left to their own devices. The Tibetan Terrier is extremely trainable, friendly, outgoing, and adaptable to many living environments. But sometimes, this dog is too smart for its own good. Tibetan Terriers have been known to figure out how to unlock its own crates, how to find its way out of locked rooms, and any number of precocious practices. These dogs are known to outsmart their owners, so never take their intelligence for granted. It\u2019s important to note that the breed is extremely sensitive, so it\u2019s important to develop a sense of familiarity slowly and carefully. Don\u2019t expect too much from your dog during its first week or so with you. It will take time to warm up to you. Tibetan Terriers mature more slowly than other dogs, so training should continue well past its puppy stage and into adulthood. With enough care and TLC, your dog will come to trust you completely and learn how to behave appropriately. Once they make a connection with their humans, they bond for life. The Tibetan Terrier has thrived for centuries and this speaks well for its overall health. But there are a few possible hereditary problems are known to exist in the breed, which include hip dysplasia, Progressive Retinal Atrophy and lens luxation. Because of this genetic propensity for eye ailments, anyone who intends to breed a Tibetan Terrier should make sure to have the dog\u2019s eyes checked early and often for signs of potential genetic disorders. It\u2019s always important to maintain regularly scheduled check ups with your vet to ensure that any potential health issues can be identified and treated as early as possible. Tibetan Terriers have a life expectancy of 15 to 17 years. No matter where you live, your Tibetan Terrier needs to get some form of daily exercise. One walk a day isn\u2019t sufficient for this breed. It needs to get out at least twice a day. It really comes in handy if you have a large and secure yard that your dog can run around in. The important thing to remember is that your Tibetan Terrier needs to release its pent up energy, otherwise the dog may become destructive. They need to burn off all of their excess energy or that energy will be spent in ways that you won\u2019t appreciate. While walking your Tibetan Terrier, make sure it is always on a leash. Thanks to this dog\u2019s mischievous streak, it may try to escape and explore the great outdoors. And if you chase after it, it\u2019s all a big game to this pooch. They will take you on an adventure that you don\u2019t want if you aren\u2019t careful. The Tibetan Terrier is extremely trainable, friendly, outgoing, and adaptable to many living environments. The American Kennel Club says this about the breed: \u201cThe hardy Tibetan Terrier is a breed built to withstand the extreme climate and difficult terrain of its home country Tibet.

The first written records of the breed date back to the 9th century, with other mentions coming later in the 11th and 14th centuries. Unfortunately, as the practice of sheepherding diminished, so did the Tornjak breed. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s when a group of cynologists started to collect remaining specimens of the breed that the Tornjak was revived. Today it is part of the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program, the first step in becoming recognized by the AKC. The Tornjak was developed in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Croatia, likely bred from the Tibetan Mastiff, though the exact origins of the breed are unknown. As a large-breed dog, the Tornjak requires a high-quality dog food diet that has been formulated for large-breed dogs. During the breed\u2019s development it was commonly underfed.

Common colors for this breed include white, black, yellow, brown, red, gray, and any combination of these colors, though the two main types are piebald and Irish spotting.

This breed is subject to many restrictions and regulations because it may be considered a dangerous breed. In fact, it is illegal to keep the Tosa in several countries including the UK, Australia, Denmark, Iceland, New Zealand, and Turkey. If you are thinking about the breed, you should take the time to learn as much as you can about it before buying to make sure that you can handle the challenge. The Tosa is a rare Japanese breed that was developing for dog fighting. This breed was named after the Japanese province in which it was developed, the Tosa province, which is now known as the Kochi prefecture. At the time of the breed\u2019s development, Tosa was one of the two most popular areas for dog fighting \u2013 the second was the Akita prefecture. For years the Akita breed was stronger than the Tosa but, by crossbreeding the dog with various European breeds, the Tosa eventually became stronger. The Tosa was originally developed from the native Shikoku-Inu breed, an indigenous dog that closely resembled the European Spitz. This breed was then crossed with other European breeds including the Old English Bulldog, Mastiff, Saint Bernard, Great Dane, and the Bull Terrier to create a large, powerful dog designed for dog fighting. As a large breed, the Tosa should be offered a dog food diet formulated for large-breed dogs. Because this breed develops slowly you may need to keep him on a puppy diet for longer than a year to make sure he has enough fuel to foster healthy growth and development.

Positive reinforcement-based training methods are recommended for this breed but you need to maintain a firm and consistent hand in training so the dog knows who the boss is. The Tosa is a large breed (the largest out of all of breeds from Japan), though its size varies depending where it was bred. Japanese Tosas typically weigh 80 to 135 pounds, but Tosas bred outside of Japan are usually larger, between 130 to 200 lbs. This breed usually stands about 24.5 to 32 inches tall. Because the Tosa was originally bred for fighting it can be a challenging dog to keep. This breed is not recommended for inexperienced dog owners and even experienced owners may have trouble. The breed is frequently aggressive toward other dogs and he is a fearless protector and guardian, though not usually aggressive toward people. He can form strong bonds with family and may be well-mannered and peaceful around the home but he will probably always be wary around strangers. This breed can get along with children as long as he is raised with them, but rough play could trigger his fighting instinct so all interaction between the dog and children should be closely supervised.

After all, it\u2019s rare to find a toy breed so durable, sturdy, and generally outgoing. These qualities are a mark of the Toy Fox Terrier\u2019s unique pedigree, which we\u2019ll detail in this overview of the breed. Is a Toy Fox Terrier for you? That depends on what kind of dog you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s not a cold-weather dog, but it is suited for apartment life, so it can do well in a number of warmer cities and will not go crazy without a gigantic yard to dwell in. Active dogs that do require a daily walk, they will be noticeable and far from the personality of a cat, which can be a bit difficult if you also own cats.

The Toy Fox Terrier can be a bit like the Napoleon of the dog world: small in stature, but full of confidence. The Toy Fox Terrier\u2019s status as a great hybrid of toy and terrier is the result of its pedigree, which we\u2019ll get into in the next section. Having been bred from Fox Terriers originally, this is a uniquely American breed because it saw its first development in the U.S. in the 1930s, being crossed with a number of toy breeds to create what is essentially a small, rambunctious version of the Fox Terrier. With its first use as hunting rats, it\u2019s apparent that the Toy Fox Terrier was not only a show dog from its early days, but actually be of some use around the house and yard to get tasks done.

This cannot be said of all dogs that have more peculiar and mysterious histories, but the Toy Fox Terrier has a specific pedigree that can be quickly identified. And what is that pedigree? It descends mostly from Fox Terriers, of course, but was mixed with breeds like Manchester Terriers, Italian Greyhounds, Chihuahuas, and Miniature Pinschers to create what is essentially a miniature Fox Terrier. The breeding means that the Toy Fox Terrier has taken on some qualities of these other breeds. And as these other breeds are frequently suited for city life themselves, it stands that the Toy Fox Terrier is as well. An outgoing, confident personality comes as the result of this overall breeding and pedigree. A tiny dog with a tiny weight, you\u2019ll want to take special care not to overfeed this breed.

Weighing only three to seven pounds, this dog is indeed a toy breed. Even though its personality is strong, keep in mind that it can be a very delicate creature. Overfeeding is a potential concern because even one pound on a seven-pound frame is a significant weight gain. Intelligent, obedient, willing to work, this is the kind of toy dog that people who really love \u201cworking\u201d dogs can still enjoy. It\u2019s small but with the personality of a regular terrier, in many ways, and will even show these instincts by hunting small rodents and pests around the house. Given good discipline, it will be a good companion and willing to obey commands. Because it\u2019s a small dog, be sure to teach children how to handle it and not to be aggressive with it.

These dogs have high exercise requirements but, as long as those needs are met, they can be wonderful family pets. Also known as the Tyroler Bracke, the Tyrolean Hound is known for its scenting skill and ability to withstand rough conditions. The Tyrolean Hound was developed in Tryol in the late 1800s. Descended from ancient Celtic hounds, this breed was developed from the old Bracke hounds in the Tyrol region. Breeding began in 1860 and the first standard for the breed was published in 1896. These dogs were bred for their hunting ability and their stamina \u2013 they were also bred to work tirelessly in cold, harsh conditions. The modern Tyrolean Hound is an excellent hunting dog for mountains and wooded terrain, used to hunt fox, hare, and other game. They are also used to track wounded game. Though the Tyrolean Hound has yet to be recognized by the AKC, it was recognized by the UKC in 2006 and is a member of the FCI\u2019s scent hound group (Group 6). The Tyrolean Hound was developed from ancient Celtic hounds including old Bracke hounds. As a medium-sized dog, the Tyrolean Hound should be fed a high-quality dry food formulated for adult dogs. Because this breed was developed specifically for hunting, however, he may do well on an active or working breed formula. Just keep an eye on your dog\u2019s weight and body composition to ensure that he doesn\u2019t gain too much weight. Tyrolean Hounds are alert and lively, though they may be a bit wary of strangers. Because the Tyrolean Hound is highly intelligent, training is usually easy to do. These are hounds, however, so be prepared for a little stubbornness from time to time. The best thing you can do is use positive reinforcement training methods and maintain a firm and consistent hand in leadership. You do not need to use force or punishment, but be a strong leader for your dog. You should start training from a young age and keep socializing your dog throughout his life. The Tyrolean Hound is a medium- to large-sized dog, standing between 18.5 and 24 inches tall and weighing 35 to 60 pounds at maturity. Females of the breed tend to be a little smaller than males, growing 16.5 to 19 inches tall.

The Tyrolean Hound doesn\u2019t like to be restricted to small spaces or left alone for long periods of time \u2013 he enjoys spending time with family and tends to form strong bonds, even with children. If you have a lot of space and time to devote to him, the Tyrolean Hound makes a good family pet. The Tyrolean Hound is a robust breed and generally healthy. Even so, all dogs are prone to developing certain health problems. Some of the problems most commonly seen in Tyrolean Hounds include hip dysplasia, field injuries, and bloat. This breed may also be prone to ear infections because its ears hang down low. The average lifespan for the Tyrolean Hound is thought to be about 12 to 14 years which is fairly long for a breed of its size. Feeding your Tyrolean Hound a healthy, high-quality diet will help to maximize his lifespan, as are regular vet checkups. The Tyrolean Hound has high exercise requirements, though he doesn\u2019t tend to be hyperactive.

Too much bathing can dry out his skin. The average litter size for the Tyrolean Hound is 6 to 8 which is fairly large for a dog.

Often it all comes down to aesthetics. Some want a dog that looks as close to a teddy bear as possible for obvious reasons. Others seek a pup that resembles like a hot dog or large rodent due to their specific taste in cuteness. Then there are the owners who want a dog that looks less like a toy and more like a predator. They essentially want to own a pet wolf without any of the inherent danger. It\u2019s that specific type of dog owner that we\u2019re targeting today. If you fall into that category, then you are going to love the Utonagan. When you see the Utonagan dog breed for the first time, you might think that you are looking at a wolf. That\u2019s no accident. In fact, the Utonagan breed was specifically developed to look like a wolf. Originally sold as a wolf hybrid, this dog is actually a mix of three distinct breeds. Despite their wild appearance, Utonagan dogs make wonderful companions and family pets, though they may be a challenge for inexperienced dog owners. This is not exactly an ideal first dog to train, requiring an owner with a very specific set of skills. Owing to their unique parentage, largely based on working dog breeds, these hybrids require a firm hand and someone who can act as the leader of the pack. They are not aggressive dogs but they can be strong-willed and can develop behavior issues if their owners don\u2019t work with them on time. If trained and socialized on time, Utonaganas are fantastic companions for families with children or active singles and couples. They do need a fair amount of exercise, so the wolf-dog might not be the best choice for a small apartment in the city. Farms and houses with big fenced-in backyards are dream furever homes for the Utonagan.  Do you have the right temperament to raise an Utongan right? Or is this a dog destined to walk all over you? There\u2019s only one way to find out. Keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away. We are about to reveal everything that there is to know about this remarkable breed of dog. By the end, you\u2019ll either be racing out to find a Utongan breeder or researching other dogs that might be more suitable for your home. The Utonagan breed was specifically developed to look like a wolf. Originally known as the Wolf Dog, the Utonagan breed was developed during the 1980s by Edwina Harrison. Harrison created the breed by crossing five mixed-breed rescue dogs of unknown origin with Siberian Husky, German Shepherd, and Alaskan Malamutes. The goal of this crossing was to produce a dog that had a wild and wolf-like appearance combined with the sweet and gentle nature of a domesticated dog. Throughout the years, various breeders took to developing the breed, making sure to select the finest dogs for breeding through meticulous genetic screening for health issues. The Utonagan breed was first created (and later developed) in the United Kingdom, and has had a few name changes since its start including wolf-dog, and Northern Inuit. There are also British Utonagans, which are the result of Utonagan dogs bred to one of the founding breeds- Alaskan Malamute, German Shepherd, Siberian Husky- or a Northern Inuit dog. The breed has yet to gain any recognition from major breed clubs including the AKC, the UKC, and the British Kennel Club. It will still take a few more generations of development before any of those clubs will be willing to even consider recognizing the Utonagan.  The Utonagan was developed from several mixed-breed rescue dogs crossed with Siberian Husky, German Shepherd, and Alaskan Malamutes. This is a so-called hybrid breed, and throughout multigenerational breeding, breeders managed to achieve a consistent appearance and behavior. As the Utonagan dogs are not officially recognized by any of the major canine clubs or organizations, their puppies won\u2019t have pedigree papers. However, a reputable breeder will offer a health guarantee, or even certification from one of the smaller clubs focused on developing these dogs within certain standards. It\u2019s worth asking your breeder for the Utonagan\u2019s parents\u2019 papers. A reputable breeder should at least provide those. If not, then that breeder likely shouldn\u2019t be trusted, encouraged, or patronized.   The Utonagan might look like a wolf, but he\u2019s certainly not going to hunt down his meals. You\u2019ll still have to serve it for him! And don\u2019t let their \u201cwild\u201d looks fool you. Like all dogs, these hybrids will also require a well-balanced diet that includes meat, healthy fats, and fiber from plants. In most cases, pet owners opt for commercial dry food to meet their dog\u2019s dietary requirements, and you can do the same for your Utonagan dog. However, it\u2019s important to make sure you choose the right type of kibble for their unique needs. As a large-breed dog, the Utonagan should be fed a high-quality dry food formulated for large breeds. The Utonagan is also a very active breed, so he may respond well to an active or working breed formula. Additionally, you will want to pay attention that the food is age appropriate. Utonagan puppies are fast-growing and will need a different type of food than an adult or a senior.  Alternatively, you may opt for raw food or cooking meals for your dogs. While these can be valid options to meet your dog\u2019s dietary needs, it\u2019s essential to talk with a vet first. Only a professional can tell you if you\u2019re providing all the essential nutrients to your dog. In any case, though, you need to be careful about overfeeding. Stick to manufacturer\u2019s or veterinarian\u2019s recommendations on the amount of food your dog needs throughout different stages of life. Obesity can be particularly hard for the Utonagan, as he is a large dog and his joints will suffer from added weight. As always, it\u2019s worth consulting with a veterinarian before establishing or altering your dog\u2019s diet. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines, they are still just guidelines and won\u2019t necessarily apply to every dog. The only person qualified to determine the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is a vet. So always refer to expertise of your pup\u2019s doc before making any major decisions about what to pour into the food bowl. Despite their wild appearance, Utonagans make wonderful companions and family pets. The Utonagan was bred primarily to look like a wolf \u2013 it wasn\u2019t developed for any specific working ability, though these dogs can be trained for many different things. This breed is highly intelligent and people-oriented, so he responds well to training. These dogs are quick to learn, but their size and their capacity for boredom may pose a challenge for inexperienced dog owners. This breed requires clear boundaries and a firm hand in leadership, however punishment and rough treatment will not be tolerated (this is closer to abuse than training). These dogs do require a good bit of training and socialization from an early age, especially if you want them to get along with other pets because they have a high prey drive. It takes a very specific type of dog owner to train and tame a Utonagan. If you are considering a Utonagan as your first dog, it might not be the wisest choice. At the very least, it might be worth considering a professional trainer to help lighten the load during those early and impressionable puppy days. The Utonagan is a large dog, standing 23 to 30 inches tall and weighing anywhere from 55 to 110 pounds at maturity. Males of the breed tend to be larger than females. Despite its wild appearance, the Utonagan was specifically bred to be a gentle, people-loving breed. This breed has a friendly, gentle temperament and they love to spend time with family \u2013 they also have a particular love for children. These dogs are unfailingly even-tempered, though they are prone to behavioral problems if they don\u2019t get enough mental or physical exercise. These dogs can be somewhat dominant as well, so they need an experienced dog owner who will set clear boundaries and maintain a strong position of leadership. This breed loves to spend active time with family and does very well in various dog sports. The Utonagan is a healthy breed with a long lifespan compared to many breeds of its size. This breed is prone to several health problems, however, which may include hip dysplasia, epilepsy, Addison\u2019s disease, von Willebrand\u2019s disease, and various eye problems. It\u2019s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a veterinarian (especially as your pup ages into his senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible. The average lifespan for the Utonagan is between 12 to 15 years. Similar to the three breeds from which the Utonagan was developed, these dogs require a significant amount of daily exercise. This is not a hyperactive breed, but he does have a good bit of energy that needs to be released through a long daily walk and active playtime or free time to run in a fenced yard. If he doesn\u2019t get enough exercise, he is highly prone to developing behavioral problems. These dogs also need plenty of mental stimulation to prevent boredom. That means that these dogs are only suitable for owners willing to dedicate significant time everyday to keep their pup well exercised and stimulated. They won\u2019t do well as indoor dogs who are left alone for significant periods of time. They need more more attention and care than that in order to thrive. Utonagans have a particular love for children. The Utonagan is not currently recognized by the AKC. The Utonagan has a medium-long double coat that comes in various combinations of black, grey, and white. The coat is very thick with straight, smooth guard hairs in the outer coat and a soft, dense undercoat. Dogs of this breed should have a clearly defined mask and any pied or ink marked colors are not preferred. Despite the length of the Utonagan\u2019s coat, it is easy to maintain \u2013 it only requires twice weekly brushing. The breed does blow its coat during the spring or late summer, however, which may necessitate extra grooming. The average litter size for the Utonagan is 4 to 8 puppies. Because it is a large breed, you need to be careful about feeding puppies so that they don\u2019t grow too quickly. If large-breed puppies grow too fast it could put strain on the bones and joints, predisposing the dog to musculoskeletal problems as an adult. Feed your puppies a large-breed puppy formula until they reach 80% of their maximum size then switch to a large-breed adult formula or working breed formula. Do not even consider switching food before then. As puppies, they should be monitored carefully around children to ensure that there is no rough play. While Utonagans will grow into strong adult dogs, they will be quite fragile as puppies and need to be treated with gentle care.", "facts": " not applicable active singles, active families, house with a yard, experienced dog owners gentle, loyal, loving, versatile", "tags": "dog sports, double coat, even-tempered, gentle temperament, good with children, Utonagan, wolf, wolf hybrid, "}, "vizsla": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/vizsla", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/vizsla.jpg", "name": "Vizsla", "type": "dog", "text": "You\u2019ve got to have plenty of energy to keep up with the Vizsla.

The Vizsla was first depicted in the tenth century, followed by an illustration in the 14th century manuscript of the Vienna Chronicle. Back then, the Vizsla were honed for the fine arts, testing, pointing, retrieving, and sniffing. To guarantee the breed\u2019s survival after WWI, The Hungarian Kennel Club (MEOE) initiated strict implementation of breed standards, but after WWII, Vizslas were nearly extinct. A few of the breed were saved, and breeding started anew. Today, Vizslas are highly regarded for its hunting and showing abilities. Since the Vizsla is such an ancient breed, it\u2019s quite difficult to pinpoint which breed it originated from. The Vizsla was used in the development of other breeds, including the Weimaraner, Wirehaired Vizsla and German Shorthair Pointer breeds. As well, there is much conjecture about those same breeds, along with other pointer breeds, that were used to help reestablish the Vizsla breed after its decline. The Vizsla was recognized by the AKC in 1960. Since the Vizsla is such an active dog, it\u2019s important to make sure you are giving it enough nutrients. This breed does well on a raw diet, as well as on high-grade dog food that lists the first ingredient as meat. It also does well on chicken or lamb.

While trying to preserve the breed, it led to inbreeding, and thus numerous health issues surfaced. Although not all lines of the breed are affected, some of these health conditions include eye and stomach problems. The Vizsla may suffer from progressive retinal atrophy, entropion, ectropion, and corneal dystrophy. With its stomach, this dog may suffer from dysphagia-megaoesophagus, which makes it difficult for the dog to swallow. This disease is characterized by muscle wasting and constant drooling.

This breed is a natural watchdog because he will bark at anything \u2013 this also means that he needs plenty of training to control unwanted barking. This breed might do well in dog sports as a means to work off his energy and keep his mind sharp. The Volpino Italiano is a toy breed standing 9 to 12 inches tall and weighing 9 to 14 pounds. The Volpino Italiano is an active and playful breed by nature, though you need to be careful around children because of its small size. These dogs bond closely with family and will always be suspicious around strangers, though they don\u2019t tend to be aggressive or territorial. The Volpino Italiano typically doesn\u2019t have a strong prey drive but may try to dominate smaller animals. He is, however, moderately dog friendly and cat friendly. Generally speaking, the Volpino Italiano has a very long lifespan and a low risk for serious health problems. Some of the conditions to which the breed may be prone include orthopedic issues common to small and toy breeds like patellar luxation. The breed may also be prone to eye problems like primary lens luxation. The average lifespan for the Volpino Italiano is 14 to 16 years. Though the Volpino Italiano itself is a companion pet, it comes from working stock. As such its energy levels are higher than many toy breeds, but still only moderate compared to many other dogs. This breed does well with 30 to 45 minutes of exercise per day. If the breed\u2019s exercise needs aren\u2019t met, it is likely to become hyperactive and noisy. The Volpino Italiano is an active and playful breed by nature. The Volpino Italiano is not currently recognized by the AKC. In fact, the organization declined the breed in 2006 due to its similarity with the American Eskimo Dog. The breed is recognized by both the UKC and the FCI. As a descendant of Spitz-type breeds, the Volpino Italiano has a thick double coat. The undercoat is short and dense while the top coat is long, dense, and straight. White is the primary color for this breed, though some dogs are solid red or champagne in color. The coat forms a thick muff around the neck with longer hair on the tail, forming a sort of fringe. The average litter size for the Volpino Italiano is 4 to 6 puppies. Because this breed has a tendency to be very active and social, early training and socialization is required. It\u2019s a good idea to enroll these dogs in puppy classes as soon as possible to prevent the development of problem behaviors.", "facts": " not applicable active singles, active families, seniors, urban dwellers lively, playful, affectionate, alert", "tags": "Italy, Volpino Italiano, "}, "weimaraner": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/weimaraner", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/weimaraner.jpg", "name": "Weimaraner", "type": "dog", "text": "Tell someone you own a \u201cWeimaraner\u201d and there\u2019s a decent chance they might not know what you mean. But that\u2019s okay. However, show the same person your dog and they\u2019ll say \u201cOh, sure \u2013 I know that breed!\u201d It\u2019s hard to get past the Weimaraner when you\u2019re talking about friendly, confident dogs that are perfect to play with. But what is it about the greyish, monochromatic Weimaraner that attracts so many people as pet owners? Is it just a matter of the personality? As you\u2019re about to find out, many dogs have a unique personality, but it\u2019s the Weimaraner that really delivers both as a companion and as a pet, especially for a dog with a relatively large size and of such unique athletic abilities. Perhaps this is what made the \u201cGrey Ghost\u201d a favorite with nobility and royalty over the years. Known for its ability to maintain composure at great speeds, the Weimaraner is a true hunter and some have even suggested that the original Weimaraner dogs were bred to hunt lions. The Weimaraner may sound like a funny and unique breed, but really it can be one of the most versatile types of dog out there. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what makes the Weimaraner different from all of the other breeds you\u2019ve been considering for you and your family. It\u2019s hard to get past the Weimaraner when you\u2019re talking about friendly, confident dogs that are perfect to play with. The history of the Weimaraner is not well-known simply because it dates back many years ago. Some have suggested that the original Weimaraners were bred to hunt lions, but this might be a myth \u2013 there\u2019s no real verification about this fact. The American Kennel Club notes that the Weimaraner was originally the Weimer and had been bred in Germany some time ago. Possibly a descendant of bloodhounds, it was bred for hunting purposes and was developed to have an athletic, agile build with enough strength to present it as a formidable force out in the fields and forests. The pedigree of the Grey Ghost isn\u2019t totally known, but many people believe that the Weimaraner descends from blood hounds and similar breeds. Originally bred to hunt big game like wolves, deer, and even bear, we can assume that the Weimaraner came from healthy, well-sized stock and possibly was developed and bred from ancestors of a similar build in the hound category. Today\u2019s Weimaraner dogs are strong and agile and its overall build suggests similarities to hounds in a number of groups. A hunter by instinct, the Weimaraner likes a good piece of meat as much as any dog, but can also go for whole foods like vegetables. Kibble can be flavored with some fat or meat to entice these dogs, and keep in mind that it\u2019s important to meet its appetite needs and not let it feel starved throughout the day. The Weimaraner may sound like a funny and unique breed, but really it can be one of the most versatile types of dog out there. With a high propensity toward hunting activities, the Weimaraner can be strong and obedient. They should not necessarily be trained like Golden Retrievers \u2013 a hunting dog that\u2019s friendlier toward strangers \u2013 but should be properly socialized so that they know the world doesn\u2019t revolve around your piece of land or your family. Its loyalty can be tricky, so be sure to be relaxed and give your dog plenty of opportunities to socialize with other dogs as it grows up so that it can learn the proper methods of socialization. Large and strong, the Weimaraner can weigh up to around 70-80 pounds in males and between 55-70 pounds in females. Don\u2019t let it relatively high weight fool you, as it\u2019s important to realize that these pets come with a lot of speed relative to its size. This gives them an extra bit of oomph if you\u2019re ever out playing with one in an open field. As mentioned, the Weimaraner is a typical hunting dog in many respects, but isn\u2019t quite the socializer or friendly personality that the Golden Retriever might be. The Weimaraner is more aloof and territorial, especially around other dogs, so it\u2019s important to remember that Weimaraners are often more suited for a spacious country life rather than exercising at parks in the city. Weimaraners are very intelligent and more advanced trainers really appreciate this, especially given the fact that Weimaraners can be a bigger challenge. As a relatively aloof breed in some ways, discovering ways to use this dog\u2019s intelligence can unlock other positive aspects of its personality. Unlike some other larger breeds, dysplasia and joint problems are not a major concern for the Weimaraner, although such things should always be monitored nonetheless. Because of its deep chest, these dogs can have a higher propensity toward bloating or a condition known as gastric torsion, which can lead to death if left untreated. Expect a life expectancy of around 9-15, typical for a dog of this size. With a lot of speed comes a high tolerance to exercise, so be sure to give your Weimaraner plenty of space to roam around in. This is another reason this particular breed is so well-suited for the country life. The Weimaraner is more aloof and territorial, especially around other dogs. Says the American Kennel Club: \u201cLauded for his ability to work with great speed, fearlessness and endurance when on the hunt, the Weimaraner is also known for being an easily trainable, friendly and obedient member of the family.\u201d A relatively short coat means low maintenance required. The characteristic grey coat has given rise to the term \u201cGrey Ghost\u201d to describe this breed.

Another interesting fact about this breed is that, like their wild ancestors, West Siberian Laika females only go into estrus once per year, generally whelping their puppies in the spring time.

With a variety of great advantages to both outdoors men who love a good companion pet and families who want to raise an athletic dog, the Whippet is a great alternative to the Greyhound and can really make a great lifelong friend. Known as sweet and friendly, the Whippet is also recognized for having an expression that actually closely resembles a smile, which is more than a variety of dogs can say (even dogs that have a reputation for being friendly domestic companions). The Whippet also has a variety of well-bred athletic abilities, including an extremely fast speed of up to around 35 miles per hour, the fastest for a dog of its weight. If you\u2019re interested in a Whippet for athletic training or simply to find a good family friend, it will be hard to go wrong here. Let\u2019s learn more about the history and context of this interesting and cheerful animal. Known as sweet and friendly, the Whippet is also recognized for having an expression that actually closely resembles a smile. The Whippet, while lesser known than the Greyhound, is a member of the sighthound family and actually has a long and rich history that dates back to the 17th century. One Whippet makes an appearance in a centuries-old painting. Misse was a dog presented to Louis XV of France, although old French records list these dog types as the \u201clevrette\u201d (translates to female Greyhounds). Even so, this closely tied pedigree means that the Whippet\u2019s genetic ancestry goes back a few hundred years in Europe and even includes some connections to royalty, which is always an interesting fact for dog lovers. The English Kennel Club officially recognized the Whippet in 1890, making it a breed that\u2019s gained recognition before some of the most popular and well-known breeds in existence today. This rich origin story, along with an 1888 American Kennel Club recognition, makes the modern Whippet just that \u2013 a modern take on a centuries-old breed that\u2019s distinguished itself from its more famous cousin, the Greyhound. As already mentioned, the most prominent relative of the Whippet is the Greyhound. As the Whippet is a member of the sighthound group, its pedigree is easily seen in its physical features, which include a medium-sized built with a light, athletic stature. Today\u2019s Whippets can run a little larger in the United States than in some other countries, but it\u2019s clear that the overall pedigree remains the same. Whippets were used early on for racing, similar to the Greyhound, as its lightning-fast speed made for an incredible show. Racing Whippets is not quite as popular nowadays, with the emphasis on Greyhounds, but Whippets are still renowned for its athletic abilities. Breeding over the years has also made for a friendly dog with relatively lower amounts of territorial and/or aggressive instincts. The Whippet has a large frame but its overall build is still light, so feeding your Whippet too much can become a habit to avoid. Resist the temptation to overfeed and make sure your Whippet works up a good appetite with a daily workout regimen. A Whippet should remain light and maintain its speed over the majority of its lifetime in order to remain healthy. The Whippet is generally friendly to humans and other dogs, which makes the it a good addition to the family. Whippets are actually known as sensitive breeds, which mean they should not be over trained. Special care should be taken to avoid negative reinforcement. Instead, positive reinforcement will help develop a natural and healthy self-esteem, as it is easy to \u201ccross over the line\u201d with Whippets and confuse them as to why you\u2019re angry or impatient. A good trainer will be able to handle a Whippet with relative ease. Weighing just around 15-25 pounds in most cases, the Whippet is relatively light considering its impressive stature and frame. This lightness combined with a long stride helps makes for a very quick dog. If you ever notice your Whippet losing its quickness and open-field running abilities, it may be time to put it on an exercise regimen or a diet \u2013 or both! The Whippet is not a highly aggressive dog, but it does have the genes of a hunting dog which means it will seek out and attack smaller animals. It is generally friendly to humans and other dogs, which makes this dog a good addition to the family. Whippets can be considered a relatively healthy breed, often avoiding many of the skin problems of other breeds as well as digestive issues. Eye problems can develop in rare cases, but for the most part you can consider the Whippet a low-maintenance dog, health-wise. Most Whippets should live around 12-15 years. Open fields and daily walking should be considered requirements for this eager-to-run animal, and you\u2019ll want to be careful about taking it in parks without a leash as it will be prone to attacking small critters. A large backyard is ideal for this animal, and one could even consider the Whippet a good \u201ccountry\u201d dog. A very versatile breed, they can appear in a wide variety of colors and markings. The American Kennel Club\u2019s review of the Whippet: \u201cA very versatile breed, they can appear in a wide variety of colors and markings. Although keen when racing or coursing, they are quiet and dignified in their owner\u2019s living room.\u201d A short coat with a variety of colors, the Whippet requires relatively little maintenance in the area of grooming and will not be prone to coat or skin problems. This is an easy dog to groom and is considered to be an average shedder. You\u2019ll probably also find that the short coat makes for a minimal \u201cdog\u201d smell in your house, which is always a plus if you live in tight quarters.

Here is what you should know about the breed before you make it a part of your family. Often referred to fans of the breed as \u201cYorkies,\u201d this bold and fearless dog makes a great addition to a family. The Yorkshire Terrier was first bred in the 19th century in the county of Yorkshire, England to catch rats and other vermin in clothing mills. The Yorkshire Terrier was owned predominantly by the working class. In particular, they tended to live in the homes of professional weavers. An evolution of other terrier breeds, the Yorkshire Terrier can trace its heritage from the Waterside Terrier, Manchester Terrier and Paisley Terrier. So this sweet little pup has quite the pedigree. A part of the English Kennel Club since the club was started in 1873, the Yorkshire Terrier came to the U.S. in the 19th century where it has remained a popular breed. The portable pooch was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885, and has become a popular breed in North American thanks to its big personality and luxurious coat. Perpetually popular, these dogs are favourites at pet shops and dogs shows alike.  The Yorkshire Terrier is a relatively newer breed, making its appearance in the 19th century. It was bred from terriers such as the Waterside Terrier, Manchester Terrier and Paisley Terrier in order to achieve the small stature needed for chasing and catching rats. From these humble origins came an iconic lapdog that is now a fixture in countless homes. Of course, with such a substantial history and pedigree when parent breeds are considered, the yorkie has quite a lot of traits to fulfill to be considered an ideal specimen of the breed. There is the typical short \u2013 but not stubby \u2013 snout, the small pointed ears, and of course the iconic long coat. Stature is also an important feature, as well as the little curving tail. All in all, thanks to this set standard and pedigree, a Yorkie is hard to miss and easy to recognize. Since the Yorkshire Terrier is so small, it doesn\u2019t need a large amount to food for its daily sustenance. Since the Yorkie is so cute, you may be tempted to feed it scraps or treats. It\u2019s a temptation that few dog lovers can resist. However, no matter how difficult it might seem, you must fight that urge! Over feeding a Yorkie can lead to a variety of health problems, not the least of which is the creation of an overweight dog. So, the best approach is to try a premium dry dog food and make an effort to stay away from soft food as it tends to rot its teeth. Feed your Yorkshire Terrier two or three times a day if possible. Since this dog is so small, it won\u2019t eat much at one time. This will also help your Yorkie regulate digestion. Of course, it is always crucial to pay extra attention to the quality of the food your Yorkie is getting. Proper nutrition is crucial \u2013 vitamins, nutrients and proteins are important for normal functioning. You need to make sure they are getting enough of these. As always, if you are in any way concerned about your dog\u2019s diet, it\u2019s important to consult with a veterinarian. While dog food manufacturers and pet blogs provide useful feeding guidelines for dogs, they should still be treated as guidelines and not gospel. All dogs are different after all and the only personal qualified to assess the specific dietary needs of your personal pooch is your vet. Always consult with a vet before establishing or altering your dog\u2019s diet. It\u2019s the safest approach to ensuring your pup\u2019s belly stays full without an adverse effects on the little furball\u2019s health.  Well known for its beautiful coat and lively character, the Yorkshire Terrier has become popular as both a pet and a show dog. A smart little cookie, the Yorkshire Terrier has a mind of its own. This will make the training process interesting to say the least. To properly train a Yorkshire Terrier, keep it fun. These dogs should have a good time so it feels like it\u2019s not being trained at all. It\u2019s a sneaky approach to be sure, but also the one that tends to be the most successful. Keep it fun. Keep it light. Always focus on positive reinforcement and reward-based encouragement. Anything less is closer to abuse than training and simply won\u2019t yield the results that you seek. That said, you should have fun with the process as well. Yorkies can be quite responsive to training when treated with the right approach. Be sure to teach your Yorkie a few tricks. It\u2019s something the breed excels at. Use treats as a reward, as you\u2019ll find the Yorkie will pick the tricks up quickly this way. They\u2019ll do just about anything to ensure that a savoury canine treat passes through their furry little lips. But be wary \u2013 since the Yorkshire Terrier has a mind of its own, it may try to outsmart you. They are quite clever animals who may see through all of your training games a tricks. Sometimes a firm hand (with a gentle touch) will be needed in order to train successfully. Either way, you should have a few tricks of your own up your sleeve, and it also helps to be patient. Similarly, it is good if your own personality matches that of your Yorkie \u2013 they might be more acceptable to training through some form of action and an energetic approach. A Yorkie \u2013 bred as an active rat catcher \u2013 will love a good task and some high energy problem solving. The Yorkshire Terrier should only weigh six to eight pounds. These pups are tiny little muffins. Still, don\u2019t be fooled by this diminutive stature \u2013 they can be quite hardy and healthy throughout their life, a fact that is directly proportionate to their sparky behavior.

A wonderful companion dog, this breed has a great sense of hearing and will act as a watchdog \u2013 the Yorkie never lets a thing like its small size stand in the way. Sure, this little pup won\u2019t exactly intimidate any intruders to act as a guard dog, but they will at least let you know when anyone arrives at your door (for better or worse). A devoted breed that loves to be close to its family, the Yorkshire Terrier loves attention. And even though the Yorkie makes a great family dog, it should be watched when around small children and larger dogs due to its size. These little pups are fragile and need to be treated gently.

Yorkshire Terriers have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years. This is somewhat of an average lifespan and quite reasonable by all the standards. Of course, with proper, lifelong care, a Yorkie can surpass this average lifespan and hang around for a bit longer. Nevertheless, they make excellent friends and companions for a good part of your life.  This toy dog is very active, as it loves to explore. Yorkshire Terriers like to be taken for walks and need to interact with both dogs and humans. Because it is small, exercise needs are minimal, but attention is most important. Be sure to play with your Yorkie and have an adequate range of toys available. Due to their natural tendencies as rat catchers, Yorkies will love to burrow in some hole when possible, or to solve simple tasks, as for example on a dog action course. Either way, don\u2019t hesitate with fun and playtime \u2013 a Yorkie and its mood might depend on it. Feisty and bold, the Yorkie will show off and do as it pleases. The American Kennel Club says this about Yorkshire Terriers: \u201cThough members of the Toy Group, they are terriers by nature and are brave, determined, investigative and energetic. This portable pooch is one of the most popular breeds according the AKC Registration Statistics.\u201d Its most descriptive feature, the Yorkshire Terrier\u2019s straight coat is silky and flows along the body. Its coat is a blue and tan color, and the hair on its head is usually tied up. Although it does have a long coat, the Yorkshire Terrier is not a shedder. Its coat does require daily brushing, as well as regular visit to the groomers for shaping and upkeep. Of course, not all owners prefer their pets to have such a long and flowing coat. Instead, they choose to keep a Yorkie\u2019s coat trimmed and neat \u2013 which is also one of the iconic looks of the breed. However, it might be suitable to let the coat grow out a bit during the colder months of the year, and trim it when it gets hotter. Either way, a Yorkie\u2019s coat might require some extra attention, but that\u2019s nothing an occasional visit to the groomer won\u2019t fix. A cute bundle of hair, Yorkshire Terrier puppies are hard to resist. Be sure to start grooming rituals young and introduce them to other dogs as soon as possible.
