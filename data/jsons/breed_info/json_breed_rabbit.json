Max Gotha, a rabbit judge, created this breed with the help of a fellow rabbit breeder, in the hopes of mimicking the Alaskan Fox, which had been used in the fur trade of the 1900s. Their goal was to create a breed of rabbit that would showcase long white guard hairs on a black coat so that they could profit from the pelts. Despite their plans, however, the Alaska Rabbit featured a coat that was intensely black, and the guard hairs were long and glossy black in color. But because of the beauty and uniqueness of the black, dense coat, they decided to keep this new breed as it was, rather than attempt to move the breeding in a different direction. Later, the Alaska Rabbit was used to develop the Black Rex Rabbit. Alaska Rabbits were exhibited for the first time at a rabbit show in Europe in 1907. Once people saw these beautiful animals, the breed gained recognition quickly. Later, Gotha would end up taking the Alaska Rabbit into Canada and the United States, and they were recognized as a breed in the middle of the 1970s. However, the breed\u2019s recognition within the United States was short-lived because the Black Havana Rabbit, which became popular in the 1980s, caused the Alaska Rabbit to be dropped from the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) registry. Breeders are still working on helping this breed make a comeback within the US. This breed is recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRC). Alaska Rabbits are known for being good-tempered and docile animals. Alaska Rabbits have balanced and well-rounded bodies, and even though they are not compact like other breeds, they do feature good bone development. They are often described as thickset, solid, and blocky. Males will be a bit heavier, while females will have features that are more feminine, and females will also showcase a dewlap. The ears of the Alaska Rabbit should be short when compared to similar breeds. They will also be broad, rounded at the ends, and help upright. The Alaska Rabbit\u2019s short coat is one of its most distinguishing features because it is luxurious, soft, and dense. An Alaska Rabbit will be solid colored, and the only color that these rabbits feature is black. If you look at the fur that is nearest to the skin, it will typically be deep slate blue in color, but it will turn into a jet black color towards the surface of the fur. The pads of the rabbit\u2019s feet, as well as the belly and nose, will often feature a matte black hue, while the sides and the top of this rabbit are colored vibrantly. Overall, the fur is considered lustrous and silky, and there is an obvious glossy sheen. These rabbits also feature dark brown eyes and dark toenails. There might also be just a few white hairs scattered throughout the fur, but there shouldn\u2019t be a high number of stray white hairs, white patches, or white spots. An Alaska Rabbit will be solid black. You can keep your Alaska Rabbit indoors or outside, but just be sure to provide him with a secure area where he will be able to get some sunshine while feeling safe. Even though your pet should have a place to sunbathe, he also needs a shaded spot to retreat to whenever he wants to. An outdoor hutch should be weatherproof and waterproof, and you can use sawdust as a substrate that can be cleaned easily. If you are going to be keeping your rabbit indoors with other pets, introduce the animals to one another carefully, preferably while they are young. You should provide your rabbit with a place to rest undisturbed, such as a dog crate, and you should rabbit-proof your home so that he will not chew on anything that could be dangerous or important to you while he is outside of his cage. Your Alaska Rabbit\u2019s diet can consist of high quality pellets for rabbits, along with various hays and plenty of greens and vegetables. This will ensure he gets the nutrition he needs without gaining too much weight. As with all other rabbit breeds, you can vaccinate your Alaska Rabbit to protect him against VHD (viral haemorrhagic disease) and myxomatosis, as these are conditions that could potentially be fatal. You can also treat your rabbit for worms, ticks, and fleas on a regular basis, especially if you will be allowing your pet to spend time outside. Dental hygiene will also be important in order to prevent your rabbit\u2019s teeth from becoming overgrown. Provide your pet with a diet that is high in fibrous green veggies, such as kale and cabbage, along with plenty of high quality hays. You can also provide gnaw toys designed to be safe for rabbits. The fur of the Alaska Rabbit is lustrous and silky, with a glossy sheen. Alaska Rabbits are known for being good-tempered and docile animals. They are not aggressive, and they have an outgoing personality that makes them a great option for a family who is seeking a pet rabbit. These animals are loving and gentle, and they will enjoy spending a lot of time with you. Plus, these pets are smart and litter trainable too. Like other rabbits, you can expect that your Alaska Rabbit will typically be more active in the morning and at night. Your pet will need regular playtime sessions and will be energetic, so provide him with toys, but also be prepared to snuggle with him once he is tired and ready to relax. It\u2019s also important to note that this breed could be skittish, so it is not the best choice for families with young kids. Anyone who handles these rabbits should know how to do so with gentleness in order to prevent injuries.", "facts": " Commercial Rabbit owners of all experience levels, including families with older children and other pets Outgoing, gentle, good-natured, social, friendly", "tags": "Alaska Rabbit, argente rabbit, Champagne d\u2019Argent Rabbit, Dutch Rabbit, havana rabbit, himalayan rabbit, rabbit breed, "}, "american chinchilla rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/american-chinchilla-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/american-chinchilla-rabbit.jpg", "name": "American Chinchilla Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The first American Chinchilla Rabbit was developed by French engineer M.J. Dybowski, and were first shown in April 1913 in Saint-Maur, France. Enchanted by its gorgeous coat, the new breed took the fur trade by storm. The first Chinchilla rabbits to hit the English market were in the summer of 1917 thanks to an import from a Mrs. Haidee Lucy-Hulbert of Mitcham Surrey. In 1919, a British exhibitor presented a shipment of these rabbits at the New York State Fair. The exhibitor sold his entire stock to Edward H. Stahl and Jack Harris. American breeders set to develop this Chinchilla rabbit with a larger body (the original ones were a mere 5-7.5 lbs) in order for the breed to be meat and fur-worthy animals. Through selective breeding, the American Chinchilla Rabbit was developed, and in 1924, the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) recognized this breed. American Chinchilla Rabbits have a soft, short, rollback coat which does not need much maintenance. American Chinchilla Rabbit has a commercial-shaped body and weighs about 9-12 lbs once fully developed. Its commercially-shaped body is on the stocky side, as they were originally developed for their meat and fur. American Chinchilla Rabbits have a soft, short, rollback coat which does not need much maintenance in order to keep it healthy. Most rabbits shed during the fall and spring, which means you may find more hair indoors than you usually do. Simply brush your rabbit once biweekly for a few weeks until they cease shedding so much. There is only one color accepted by the ARBA with the American Chinchilla rabbit, and that\u2019s the color of an actual chinchilla. The under color is dark slate blue at the base and the top edge is a darker blue with a portion of light gray in between. The slight eye circles are well defined and of a light pearl color and the underside of the tail is also white while the topside is mostly black with a few white hairs. Eye colors can be brown, blue-grey or marbled, but dark brown is preferred.  Petting your American Chinchilla Rabbit\u2019s head, neck, back and ears is very much encouraged. The American Chinchilla Rabbit does well in indoor or outdoor enclosures so long as they are not exposed to extreme heat or cold. Outdoor enclosures should be lifted from the ground to protect them from potential predators and have a ramp to the fenced bottom so they can hop about on the grass below. Indoors rabbit cages need to be large enough so the rabbit can easily stretch out and considering the American Chinchilla\u2019s size, it needs to be rather large, which is why this breed isn\u2019t recommended for apartment dwellers. Enclosures should be made of wire walls and a plastic/metal bottom to hold bedding, which needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. In terms of food, the American Chinchilla\u2019s diet does not differ from that of other rabbits. This means they need to have a diet of at least 70 percent hay (there are several available that are rabbit-safe) and the rest a healthy mix of high-quality pellets, fruits, leafy greens and vegetables. There are some fruits/vegetables/leafy greens that are better in terms of nutritional value to rabbits and others that should be avoided at all costs. Apples are a great treat, for example, but iceberg lettuce does not contain enough nutrition to be beneficial to your rabbit\u2019s health. Always do your research on what you plan to feed to your rabbit and when in doubt, call and ask your local veterinarian. While some rabbits have health issues related to their fur, the American Chinchilla Rabbit has no such problem or any other hereditary disease. However, there are some issues pet rabbit parents need to be made of aware of so they can prevent these health problems from developing in the first place. Rabbit teeth never stop growing and the only thing that keeps their teeth a manageable size is a diet high in hay \u2013 this is why a 70 percent hay diet is crucial. Overgrown rabbit teeth can grow into their jaws and face, and is painful. If you find less droppings in your rabbit\u2019s cage, they are less active than usual, and aren\u2019t eating as much, check their mouth for overgrown teeth. To deal with overgrown teeth, take them to your veterinarian for a trimming. Owners also need to check their bunny\u2019s ears for any sign of ear mites, and outdoor rabbits need to be carefully checked for any sign of flystrike, which is an extremely painful condition that is mostly fatal. Bucks and does can also be neutered/spayed, just like dogs and cats. Bucks can be spayed as young as 3.5 months, while does can be spayed once they are 5-6 months old. American Chinchilla Rabbits do well in indoors or outdoor enclosures so long as they are not exposed to extreme heat or cold. This breed of rabbit was developed mostly for their pelt and meat in the 1900s, consequently they are very much at ease being handled by humans. This means they also make great pets for single, couples or even seniors who would like a pet the size of a medium-sized dog but has less maintenance involved. While we don\u2019t recommend this larger breed for families with young children, they will make for wonderful pets for families who have older children that understand how to handle a rabbit with care. Rabbits are notoriously difficult to potty-train, but it does not mean it is impossible. In fact, many pet rabbit owners have found success with plenty of time, patience and lots of rewards. Some have gone the extra mile by placing a few litter boxes in corners of their home (instead of having just one) so their rabbit does not have to travel too far to find a litter box to do the deed. They may take longer than the average dog or cat, but rabbits are intelligent enough to understand when they are supposed to do their business in a particular area. In terms of playtime, every rabbit takes to toys a little differently \u2013 some may be perfectly content with home-made DIY toys while others may enjoy more mentally-stimulating toys from your local pet store. Whatever it is, always make sure it is bunny-safe and won\u2019t break apart into pieces your rabbit can accidentally swallow and hurt itself internally. Having said that, your rabbit\u2019s personality will flourish the longer they are outside of their enclosures engaging and interacting with their human family. Petting their heads, necks, backs and ears is completely acceptable and very much encouraged. Many rabbits also enjoy having all of this done while in the comfort of your lap, just like lap dogs (but with less drool!)", "facts": " Commercial Rabbits for Singles, rabbits for seniors, indoor/outdoor rabbits, house rabbits, families with children, first-time owners Gentle, docile, sweet", "tags": "American Chinchilla rabbit, chinchilla rabbit, commercial rabbit, rabbits for families, "}, "american fuzzy lop": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/american-fuzzy-lop/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/american-fuzzy-lop.jpg", "name": "American Fuzzy Lop", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The American Fuzzy Lop has history that\u2019s intertwined with that of the Holland Lop. There was a time when the Holland Lop rabbit was only available in solid colors, and breeders wanted to add a broken pattern to the gene pool. To do that, they bred their Holland Lops with English Spots. While they successfully produced a broken pattern, they failed to keep the Holland\u2019s rollback fur. To remedy that, the breeders then introduced their Holland Lop rabbits to French Angoras, which have famous gentle rollback coats. The result was a wool gene introduced into the Holland Lop gene pool, and eventually, Hollands with long coats were found in litters. These were sold to people who enjoyed the rabbit\u2019s small, lop-eared, woolly coat characteristics. Patty Greene-Karl and Gary Fellers of the American East Coast and Kim Landry and Margaret Miller of the American West Coast recognized how adorable these fuzzy Hollands were and sprang into action. Patty Greene-Karl is credited with realizing that their \u201cfuzzy\u201d gene was recessive, so mating two Holland Lops carrying this gene resulted in 1 in 4 of their offspring with this kind of wool. Patty then decided to develop these wooly rabbits as a new breed and so dubbed them the American Fuzzy Lop. After four years of development, she presented her rabbits in 1985 to the ARBA Convention in Houston, Texas. The American Fuzzy Lop is sweet, energetic rabbit that is known to be great for show, fur and pet purposes. The American Fuzzy Lop has a short, thick body. They have a broad chest, short shoulders and broad, deep, well-rounded hindquarters with plenty of muscles. Their fuzzy ears flop to the sides of their heads. The American Fuzzy Lop is sweet, energetic rabbit that is known to be great for show, fur and pet purposes. Their wooly coat is great to be shown off to the world and the American Fuzzy Lop is a favorite in competitions. For practical purposes, this rabbit\u2019s fur can be spun and made into different kinds of clothes.  Their curious, playful attitude makes them great pets for singles, seniors and families alike so long as they are given plenty of love, affection and a place to let their energy run free (a fenced yard would be more than sufficient). The American Fuzzy Lop\u2019s coat is actually wool, as it can be spun into yarn despite being only about 2 inches in length. These rabbits are also known as \u201cThe Head of Fancy,\u201d which lets you know how lovely their wool really is. American Fuzzy Lop wool is coarse, like that of an Angora rabbit \u2013 this means the coat will not be prone to tangling or matting. American Fuzzy Lops can be prone to matting around the tail area, mostly from sitting. Part of your grooming process should include trimming nails, brushing, and trimming the mats. The American Fuzzy Lop rabbit can come in a variety of different colors such as Agouti, which is a combination of any color with white (colors include Chestnut, Chinchilla, Lynx, Opal and Squirrel) and the Pointed White Group, which is a pure white body. However, all American Fuzzy Lops have distinctive markings on their nose, have eye circles and tinted ears. The American Fuzzy Lop\u2019s coat is actually wool, as it can be spun into yarn. Rabbits are clean animals when it comes to grooming themselves, and American Fuzzy Lops are no exception. These rabbits do not require daily grooming unless they are going through a molt. When this happens, simply run your fingers through their wool to work out any tangles and debris that may have gotten stuck in their coat. You may also use a pet-specific brush if you don\u2019t want to use your fingers, but under no circumstances should you fully bathe your rabbit; this causes them far too much stress. If you find a stain on your Fuzzy Lop\u2019s coat, you can \u201cspot clean\u201d it with a damp cloth. As with all other rabbits, their diet should consist of 70-80 percent hay and grass with the rest of their meal consisting of fresh fruits and vegetables. Make sure your rabbit\u2019s enclosure is dung-free, clean, and always has fresh water at their disposal. If your rabbit\u2019s enclosure is outdoors, always be wary of the temperatures and weather forecast, as these factors can be a potential danger to your furry animal. Whether your enclosure is indoors or out, it\u2019s best to keep this little guy happy with plenty of free time outside their cage. American Fuzzy Lops are active rabbits who love to run and jump round while basking in the sunlight, so a fenced backyard is recommended. If you live in an area where winters are particularly harsh and your Fuzzy Lop is indoors, they will still benefit from having time outside of their enclosures playing with their toys and cozying up with their favorite human. The American Fuzzy Lop is not at risk for any particular disease, however because its fur is so wooly, owners should watch out for Wool Block. Rabbits groom themselves like cats by licking their fur, but while cats can regurgitate the fur out of their system, rabbits cannot. When they eat too much of their own fur, their bodies tell them that they are full, when in reality, they are starving. If left untreated, they can die, so it\u2019s important for owners to be aware of when and how much their rabbits eat at all times. Some owners uses papaya enzyme tablets, as the enzymes are supposed to help break down the furballs (since rabbits can\u2019t regurgitate) and therefore prevent blockage. To prevent worms developing in your rabbit\u2019s stomach, de-worming paste twice a year is a must. This parasite can be ingested through your rabbit\u2019s food like hay or grass, which is why it\u2019s important to take preventative measures in order to protect them. Also keep an eye on your rabbit\u2019s fingernail and teeth growth to make sure they are not overgrowing. A rabbit\u2019s teeth grow at an incredible rate and usually, they are shaved down by their high-hay and grass diet. However, some rabbits\u2019 teeth still tend to overgrow and if this seems to be the case with your rabbit, there are several ways you can go about reducing their teeth length including giving them some rabbit-friendly wood to chew and play with. These rabbits love to play. These rabbits love to play. Their energetic nature makes them ideal for families with younger children who have never had a pet before or for couples who want to take the next step in their relationship by caring for an adorable animal. Save for the initial purchases of their enclosures and the cost of the actual rabbit, they are relatively low-maintenance animals. They don\u2019t require much grooming and simply need food, water and plenty of affection to keep them happy and healthy. Purchasing two rabbits instead of one may give both rabbits another year or two of life, as animals tend to live longer if they have some company to pass the time. However, this means their enclosure should be sufficient to hold two fully grown rabbits with plenty of space to spare. Their playfulness is best seen outdoors where they have plenty of space to bounce around and eat plenty of pesticide-free grass. American Fuzzy Lop rabbits love to hang out indoors and hang out with their families on their own watch (that is to say, whenever they feel like it). With plenty of playtime and toys, your Fuzzy Lop will be a wonderful addition to a growing family. Female rabbits can be spayed as early as 4 months of age; however vets like to wait until they are at least 6 months. This is because they older they are, the less risk there is of complications on the operating tables. Bucks can be neutered as young as 3 1/2 months old.", "facts": " Compact Indoor, Families with children, Singles, Couples Playful, active, curious, affectionate", "tags": "active rabbit, American Fuzzy Lop, Dwarf rabbit, spot clean coat, sweet rabbit, Wool Block, wool coat, "}, "american rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/american-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/american-rabbit.jpg", "name": "American Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The American Rabbit was developed in 1917 by Lewis H. Salisbury of Pasadena, California. While he never said which breeds he used to develop the American rabbit, it is generally believes that he crossed a few blue European rabbits such as the Vienna, Blue Imperial, Flemish Giant and Beveren. Back in 1910, the American rabbit used to be called the \u201cGerman Blue\u201d and a second variety of this rabbit, the white, was added in 1925. The \u201cGerman Blue\u201d changed into \u201cAmerican\u201d shortly after World War I. After WWII, interest in this rabbit declined as commercial rabbit breeders sought to find a faster-growing rabbit, and those who wanted rabbits for show purposes wanted a smaller, cuter rabbit or one with interesting markings. Unfortunately, this breed became the rarest breed in the United States by the early 2000s with a mere 200 known to exist. Thankfully, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy became aware of this problem and undertook measures to ensure the breed\u2019s survival. The American Rabbit comes with either a white or blue coat. The American rabbit has a semi-arch body type, which means the top line of the body (when viewing them from the side) doesn\u2019t immediately rise behind the ears but flattens and curves upward at the midsection. Their ears are rather narrow, proportional in length and tapered. They can weigh anywhere from 9-11 lbs. once fully grown, so they are a medium to large sized rabbit. This bunny\u2019s coat is known to be very attractive. Should you decide to have this rabbit as a pet, expect their fur to be soft, fine and have a silky texture to the touch. Both types of American rabbits (white and blue) have short, flyback fur (flyback means the coat will go back into place after being petted backwards). To keep their coat dirt-free, make sure to groom your rabbit as necessary and under no circumstances should you give them a bath, as this stresses your rabbit out and can cause them to go into cardiac arrest. Bathing them also destroys many of the natural qualities for their fur. Don\u2019t worry; rabbits are relatively clean creatures and can take care of their own bathing requirements. When your American rabbit molts, be aware of how often you brush them. If they are only shedding a little bit, keep your brushing to a minimum. Be sure to increase the amount of brushings depending on how much they shed. Remember that like dogs, rabbits also have heavier shedding periods during particular times of the year. The white American rabbit has white fur and red-colored eyes. The \u201cBlue\u201d American rabbit is a dark grey color. Both types of American rabbits (white and blue) have short, flyback fur. Most rabbits are immaculately clean, and since washing them is an absolute no-no, groom your bunny with a brush a few times a month to keep their fur in tip-top shape. When it comes to buying an enclosure for your rabbit, you have quite a few options. You can opt to have an indoor rabbit cage or purchase a dog crate and add some nifty bunny-friendly modifications, which is great for apartment dwellers. If you have a little bit more room outdoors or even have your own fenced backyard, you can purchase or build your own rabbit hutch or even a rabbit shed! But whenever you have an outdoor enclosure for your rabbit, always be aware of outdoor temperatures, how much sun your rabbit is exposed to and if there are any local predators you should be wary of (racoons, birds, coyotes, etc). Indoor rabbits will no doubt have a deep connection with their owner, especially if they take the time to play with their little hoppers. Rabbits benefit from having lots of both indoor and outdoor playtime to stretch their legs and have a great time with their human friends. Many rabbits have different places they like to be petted, however most enjoy being stroked on their cheeks and forehead. If your rabbit likes this, they will more than likely put their head on the ground and close their eyes blissfully! In terms of food, rabbits will enjoy a diet comprised mostly of pellets and hay (about 70 percent). Adult rabbits will eat about 1/4 cup of high-fiber pellets every day for every 5 pounds they weigh. They also enjoy fresh fruits and vegetables including carrots, watercress, red or green lettuce, celery, mango, pear, peach, and much more. If you wish to have your doe spayed, you can do so as soon as they are four months of age. Most veterinarians prefer to wait until they are 6 months old as the older they are, the less risk there is on the operating table. Bucks can be neutered as young as 3 1/2 months of age. The breed is not at-risk for any particular health problems, but bunnies (both domestic and commercial) are always susceptible to a number of health issues. This includes snuffles, hairballs, uterine tumors, calicivirus, myxomatosis, and overgrown teeth. The latter is completely preventable. Usually, rabbits who have a high-fiber diet of hay won\u2019t have this issue, as their teeth wear down from chewing on this harsh food. If you find your rabbit\u2019s teeth seem to be growing a little faster than they are wearing down, providing straw or wicker mats, rabbit-safe blocks of wood, or straw baskets are a great way for them to have fun and wear their teeth down. Most American rabbits are rather docile with some just barely sipping into the \u201clazy\u201d side of the scale. This breed was mostly used for commercial meat and fur purposes back in the 1900s and less of a pet. This means you can expect it to be calm, docile, and have an easy-going attitude even around humans. Depending on whether or not they were raised in close proximity to humans or always near their litter mates, they may be a little skittish around people, especially those with smaller hands and aren\u2019t really sure of how to approach them. It is for that reason that this rabbit is not completely recommended for families with younger children, as the rabbit can suddenly become scared and defend itself by nipping at the person\u2019s hand. While an adult will understand it was simply instinct, a child won\u2019t be so quick to forgive. It\u2019s all in the way and the environment in which they were raised. Some bunnies are full of energy and love to hop about for hours on end in a backyard. Most American rabbits are rather docile with some just barely sipping into the \u201clazy\u201d side of the scale. If you\u2019re looking for a companion bunny who loves to hang out, this guy is definitely for you.", "facts": " Semi-Arch/Mandolin Families with older children, seniors, Couples, Singles, Docile, quiet, calm, laid-back", "tags": "American Rabbit, flyback fur, "}, "american sable rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/american-sable-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/american-sable.jpg", "name": "American Sable Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The American Sable rabbit was first noted in early 20th century, when it was developed by Otto Brock in California. The breed was the result of crossbreeding Chinchilla rabbits with several other rabbit breeds until he achieved the desired look we know today. The American Sable Rabbit Association was founded in 1929 and the breed was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) two years later in 1931. American Sables have soft, fine, dense coat that requires more grooming that the average short-haired rabbit. The American Sable rabbit has a commercial-sized body which weights anywhere from 8-10 lbs., with males usually weighing slightly less than the females. These rabbits have a rounded head with vertical, upright ears. The American Sable rabbit has soft, fine, dense coat that requires more grooming that the average short-haired rabbit, but less than long-haired rabbit breeds like Angoras. Because their coat is so thick, they will definitely shed more during moulting periods. Owners need to be prepared for regular brushings during these heavy shedding periods, especially if your American Sable is an indoor rabbit. Simply groom your rabbit with a slicker brush outdoors 1-2 times per week as necessary during shedding season, and once every two weeks during off-season times. The American Sable rabbit only comes in one color that is accepted by the ARBA. Their head, feet, ears, back and top of tail are a dark sepia color, while the rest of their coat fades to a lighter tan, like a Siamese cat. The American Sable rabbit enjoys gentle petting on its back and between its ears. An American Sable\u2019s diet is like any other rabbits in that it should consist mainly of hay (70 percent), while the rest should be a healthy mix of pellets, leafy greens, fruits, and vegetables. Limit the amount of fruits that are high in sugar. Make sure to stay clear of iceberg lettuce, as it contains too much water and too little fiber to count as a good meal. Do not feed your rabbit yard clippings as grass is usually treated with fertilizer, insecticides, pesticides, and other chemicals that can harm your rabbit. Always research, and/or ask your veterinarian about your rabbit\u2019s diet. When it comes to enclosures, this particular rabbit breed can live in either an indoor or outdoor enclosure, so long as they are not exposed to extreme weather temperatures or conditions. Outdoor enclosures need to be raised off the ground to protect them from predators such as racoons, coyotes, wolves, and should be made of wood or metal. The top should be covered from the elements and depending on where you live, it may need to have 3/4 sides covered to protect them from extreme snow and allow air circulation. Indoor enclosures should be made of wire and have a metal or plastic bottom to allow bedding to be laid (wire bottoms are not comfortable for long periods of time and are taxing on your rabbit\u2019s feet). The bedding needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. In order for your rabbit\u2019s personality to flourish, American Sables need to have plenty of time outside of their enclosures. All rabbits are susceptible to developing overgrown teeth \u2013 the American Sable is no different. This problem is caused by a diet that lacks a proper balance of hay, which is used to slowly grind down teeth naturally. Overgrown teeth can grow into a rabbit\u2019s jaw and face. In order to prevent this condition, make sure to check your rabbit\u2019s mouth regularly for overgrown teeth and always make sure they have a proper diet consisting of mostly hay. Ears should also be checked periodically for ear mites, especially for rabbits who spend most of their time outside. Does can be spayed as young as four and a half months old (although veterinarians tend to wait until they are six months old) while bucks can be neutered as young as three and a half months of age. \u201cFixing\u201d your rabbit usually gives them a few more years of life. American Sables are energetic rabbits who will happily run round inside or out. American Sables are energetic rabbits who will happily run round inside or out, and once they\u2019ve been tuckered out, will enjoy the company of their human. They enjoy gentle petting on their backs and between their ears although they are so active that they may not even give you the chance to do so! They make great pets for singles, couples or families with children, and can live in apartments or homes with or without backyards. They also can make wonderful companions for seniors. American Sables will benefit from having a couple of toys to sink their teeth into and play with. Some rabbits enjoy having simple toys (such as plastic balls) or a piece of cardboard, while others enjoy more complex, mentally stimulating toys \u2013 it all depends on your individual rabbit\u2019s personality. Rabbits tend to be a little harder to litter train than other animals such as cats and dogs, but it is possible. Unlike cats, rabbits may need to have a few litter boxes spread out across the house.", "facts": " Commercial Suited for Sweet, active, playful", "tags": "american sable, american sable rabbit, family-friendly rabbits, rabbits for singles, "}, "argente brun rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/argente-brun-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/argente-brun-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Argente Brun Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Argente Brun Rabbit is one of the oldest French rabbit breeds. They were developed in the mid to late-19th century, popular for their usually attractive coats. During the 1920s and 1930s, these rabbits were exported to North America (Canada, specifically) from France, Germany and England. This was how the Argente Brun Rabbit got its start. A man by the name of Ed White from Canada was one of those recipients of the Argente rabbit, and sold some to Charmaine Wardrop of Washington, who was trying to find a breed to work with. In the coming years, Wardrop and husband worked with the breed to develop Argente Bruns. Thanks in part to  its beautiful coloring, the Argente Brun was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) in February of 2016. The Argente Brun Rabbit has a soft, short brown coat that doesn\u2019t need much maintenance in order to keep it healthy. The Argente Brun Rabbit is a relatively large-sized breed of rabbit, weighing anywhere between 8- 10.5 lbs once fully grown. They have a semi-arch/mandolin body shape with well-developed hind quarters, straight front legs, a broad head, and medium-sized ears that stand vertically on their heads. The Argente Brun Rabbit has a soft, short brown coat that doesn\u2019t need much maintenance in order to keep it healthy. If you find your rabbit shedding more during molting season, groom your rabbit outdoors with a slicker brush 1-2 times per week; otherwise, once every two weeks should be sufficient. Remember to spot-clean your rabbit if you find them dirty in a particular area, as rabbits should never be given baths. The British Rabbit Council recognizes five distinct kinds of Argente rabbits: Bleu (Blue), Brun (Brown), Creme, Champagne and Noir (Black); however the ARBA only accepts one kind of Argente, which is the Argente Brun. It has a deep brown undertone with the body color a brownish white, evenly mixed with longer brown hairs to give it a distinct brownish effect when viewed from a distance. The Argente Brun has bold, brown eyes, and colored toenails. Argente Bruns make excellent pets, as they are used to being handled by humans. In order to see their personalities blossom, Argente rabbits of any color need plenty of time outside of their enclosures to explore and form a lasting bond with their human families. Despite being used mainly as a show and meat rabbit, they do well with human interaction and can also make excellent pets. This particular breed does well either in indoor or outdoor enclosures, as their coat is dense enough to handle cold temperatures (even with snow), so long as their outdoor enclosures are protected from the elements. Outdoor enclosures should also be covered on three sides to protect rabbits from cold drafts in the winter, as well as provide ventilation and shade during the hotter months. Indoor enclosures need to be large enough for your Argente Brun rabbit to comfortably stretch out to their full length, plus have room leftover for toys, food, water, and other miscellaneous items. These enclosures need to be made of wire and should have a solid bottom made of either metal or plastic in order for bedding to be placed. This bedding needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of very week. The diet of an Argente Brun rabbit is like any other rabbit, which means they need a diet consisting of at least 70 percent good-quality hay (timothy\u2019s hay is what most rabbit breeders tend to use). Fruits and vegetables can also be used as incentives or treats to reward your bunny whenever they complete a task or obey a command (such as sitting, staying, or using their litter box). Adult rabbits can eat about 1/4 cup of high-fiber pellets everyday for every 5 lbs. they weigh. Always make sure to research what kind of fruit/leafy green/vegetable before adding it to your rabbit\u2019s diet, as some are not recommended. Due to the Argente Brun\u2019s short coat, they are not at-risk for digestive issues such as woodblock. They are still susceptible to other common rabbit problems such as overgrown teeth, flystrike and ear mites. Owners need to check their rabbit\u2019s ears every 2-3 weeks for ear mites. If your rabbit\u2019s diet does not consist mainly of hay, they may develop overgrown teeth. This will affect if/how much they eat, as their constantly growing teeth can grow into their jaws and faces. This can be corrected with a trip to your local vet, and then maintained by switching to a diet that is higher in hay, as it naturally grinds down your rabbit\u2019s teeth. In order to see their personalities blossom, Argente Bruns need time outside of their enclosures to explore and form a lasting bond with their human. This breed makes for an excellent pet, as they are used to being handled by humans. Argente Brun rabbits require time out of their enclosures to not only to socialize and bond with their human family, but also to stretch their legs. Should you live in an apartment, pull back the drapes so your bunny can enjoy some sun, and if you have a yard, make sure it is fenced so your rabbit won\u2019t escape. Generally, this breed is a docile, sweet bunny that will make a good pet, so long as they are socialized with humans (young and old alike). Pet rabbits who are out of their enclosures generally need some toys to keep them occupied. This can be as simple as a few rolls of empty toilet papers rolls they can chew up and destroy, to a mentally stimulating toy from your local pet store. It all depends on your rabbit\u2019s personality and what they like to play with. As with any pet, be sure you rabbit-proof your room. Training a rabbit takes a significant more amount of time, effort and patience than training another pet such as a dog or cat. While rabbits are intelligent, it merely takes them more reputations and rewards to understand that they should be doing their business in a particular area, for example. Many rabbit owners have found placing several litter boxes around their home rather than just one in their room helps, as they don\u2019t have to go too far to \u201cgo\u201d. With lots of rewards and patience, they can also be taught simple commands such as stay and come.

They were imported as early as 1856 into England,  and dubbed the \u201cBelgian Hare\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t until 1873 that a man by the name of Winter \u201cWilliam\u201d Lumb and Benjamin Greaves developed into the breed that exists today. The first Belgian Hare was shown in America in 1877 where its popularity rapidly grew. The \u201cNational Belgian Hare Club\u201d was formed in 1897, and the National Pet Stock Association added this breed under its \u201call-breed\u201d club. After many name changes, the National Pet Stock Association eventually became known as the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). In 1972, a group of Belgian Hare breeders came together and applied for a specialty club charter. Soon after, the Belgian Hare was officially accepted into the ARBA. Belgian Hares are kept mainly for show purposes. The Belgian Hare, although a domestic rabbit, was bred to closely resemble to a wild hare. It is for that reason that this breed has a long, muscular body with an arched back. They have long heads, a straight tail, which is carried in line with the backbone, and tall, slightly wide, erect ears. The Belgian Hare has short, glossy fur that requires little to no maintenance to keep it in pristine condition. Rabbits are genuinely clean animals. They should never be given a bath, as this causes great stress and can lead to heart failure. Occasionally, rub your Belgian Hare down to rid the coat of any dead fibers (no brushing required) and their coat should remain in good condition. The ARBA accepts only one kind of Belgian Hare coat color: a bright tin rust, with a red/orange tint. The entire body consists of this color, and markings include lighter-colored eye circles and \u201cticking\u201d on particular parts of the body, such as on their upper back and hips. Sudden noises or unfamiliar sounds can easily startle the Belgian Hare. This rabbit is usually kept in an outdoor enclosure that\u2019s fairly large and tall. The ideal outdoor hutch should be made of wire or wood, have a solid bottom and be at least 24 x 60 inch floor with a top that is no less than 24 inches high.  The bottom of the cages need to be lined in bedding, spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced every 5-7 days. While Belgian Hares can do fine in temperatures above the freezing mark (so long as sufficient protection and bedding is given to keep them warm), there needs to be sufficient ventilation during the summer months. When it comes to their diet, this rabbit breed needs access to clean, fresh water and high-quality hay.  Hay should be 70 percent of their diet while the rest consists of a  healthy balance of pellets and rabbit-safe vegetables, fruits and leafy greens. There are some foods that should be avoided (iceberg lettuce, for example, does not have enough nutritional value), while others are fine in moderation (apples and carrots are a wonderful treat). While Belgian Hares are not susceptible to digestive issues such as Wool Block (like long-haired breeds such as Angoras, for instance), care has to be taken in order for them to live long, healthy lives. Two problems that are most common in outdoor rabbits are ear mites and flystrike. Flystrike is common to rabbits that have soiled fur during the summer. Flies lay their eggs in soiled fur and when the eggs hatch, their primary food source is the rabbit. It is extremely painful and symptoms include lack of appetite, fewer droppings in your bunny\u2019s cage and sudden jumping/thrashing in pain. If you suspect your rabbit may have flystrike, take them to your veterinarian for treatment. A pea-sized amount of deworming paste is recommended every fall and spring to keep your rabbit healthy. Finally, if your rabbit\u2019s diet does not consist of 70 percent hay, the rabbit\u2019s incisors begin to grow into their faces/jaws. This is a painful condition and can only be corrected by a veterinarian, who can shave down their teeth. A simple change in their diet should keep their teeth naturally worn down. The Belgian hare, although domestic, was bred to closely resemble to a wild hare. The Belgian Hare requires more maintenance and care than other rabbit breeds simply because of its size and energetic nature. While this breed can theoretically live indoors, indoor rabbits tend to be pets and this rabbit breed isn\u2019t the best pet due to its nervousness. Sudden noises or unfamiliar sounds cause them jump high into the air and go into a running frenzy inside of their cage, where they could accidentally hurt themselves. While they do have a sweet nature and are known to enjoy petting (so long as they are used to the person\u2019s presence and are not suddenly spooked), Belgian Hares are not the breed for everyone and are used mostly for show purposes. While they can be picked up, a lot of care needs to be taken to ensure that if they do get spooked, they don\u2019t fall onto the floor.  Breeders use tricks to lower the risk of scaring their Belgian Hares by announcing their arrival before they open their barn doors, installing a loud fan inside the barn or playing loud music for the majority of the day.", "facts": " Full Arch Show Rabbits, Outdoor Rabbits Active, nervous, sweet", "tags": "belgian hare, ear mites, nervous, outdoor rabbits, show rabbits, wild hare, "}, "beveren rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/beveren-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/beveren-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Beveren Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "This rabbit breed\u2019s origin (not unlike other rabbit breeds) is up for debate. Some say the breed originated in England while others say its name is derived from the place it was first bred \u2013 the town of Beveran in Belgium. Believers of the latter origin (from Belgium) say this rabbit was imported in the late 1890\u2019s into Britain and were first shown around 1905 as a show animal.  The Beveren Rabbit grew in popularity, and in 1918, the Beveren Club was founded. It soon became the most popular fur breed in the UK. The breed was exported into America and by 1919, it was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). The Beveren rabbit is active and energetic, and it loves to explore its surroundings. The Beveren rabbit is large, weighing anywhere between 8-12 lbs, and it has a semi-arch/mandolin shaped body. It has a medium length torso with a broad back and a full, round face. This breed has large ears that usually measure five inches or more when it reaches adulthood, and they stand vertically on their heads, forming a \u2018V\u2019 shape. Beverens have dense, soft fur that rollback when petted. The Beveren rabbit\u2019s coat is short, glossy and thick to the touch. Like dogs and cats, rabbits generally shed more during the fall and spring months, but since the Beveren\u2019s fur is short, you may not notice it as much as other animals. Should you find that your rabbit seems to be shedding too much, simply groom them once or twice every week outdoors with a slicker brush. The Beveren rabbit comes in a variety of colors, but only three are accepted by the ARBA. This includes solid blue, solid black and the blue-eyed white (BEW). Due to its large size, Beveren Rabbits require a large enclosure to live a lengthy, comfortable life. Due to its large size, Beverens require an equally large enclosure to live a lengthy, comfortable life. If you plan to keep your Beveren outdoors, they need a wood enclosure that is raised from the ground and have a fenced bottom with a ramp. Indoor enclosures should have a wire frame on the sides and a plastic bottom where bedding can be placed.  Some rabbit cages also have wire bottoms, but the wire is harsh on the rabbit\u2019s feet \u2013 bedding is soft and more comfortable. Be sure to spot-clean the bedding every day and completely change the bedding every week. Beveren rabbits are energetic bunnies who absolutely love to explore their surroundings. Indoor rabbit rooms need to be rabbit-proofed, which means it should be free of anything that can hurt them should they decide to gnaw on them (electrical wires, for example). If you bring your rabbit outside, yards need to be enclosed (so they cannot escape your backyard) and keep an ever-vigilant eye on them to make sure they are not in any immediate danger. Like most rabbits, they will live a long, healthy life so long as they are given plenty of outdoor time and fed a diet of 70 percent hay and the rest being a mix of pellets, fruits, vegetables, and leafy greens. Some fruits and vegetables can pose a danger to their health. Some food that can be dangerous to your rabbit include seeds from fruits such as apples and pears \u2013 they contain tiny particles of cyanide and despite being harmless to humans, they can hurt your rabbit. Bark and cherry tree twigs should be avoided, as well rhubarb (it contains oxalates which prevents absorption of calcium) and mushrooms (this hurts them in the long run, as it has been shown to cause cancer in mice) The best way to prevent health problems in your pet rabbit is to ensure they have a diet which is high in hay. If your rabbit develops diarrhea because of a poor diet, their soiled coat can attract flies in the warmer months (especially if it is outdoors) and if the rabbit is unable to groom himself properly, the flies can lay eggs in its fur (near the bottom). To avoid this, make sure your rabbit eats a balanced diet and check their fur for any flies that may have landed on soiled fur. Unlike other animals, a rabbit\u2019s teeth never stop growing. Hay naturally grinds a rabbit\u2019s teeth down to a manageable size. Should you find your rabbit\u2019s teeth to be too long, make sure to bring them to your veterinarian to get them clipped. Ears should also be periodically checked (every 1-2 weeks) for ear mites, as this is another common condition for both indoor and outdoor rabbits. Beveren rabbits are generally well-mannered and docile. Beveren rabbits are active, energetic creatures who love to explore whether it is indoors or out. They are generally well-mannered and docile, making them a great pet for seniors who would like a medium-sized, four-legged company or for couples and singles who would like to take their first step into pet ownership. We do not recommend this breed for families with younger children as they do have the tendency to be a little bit skittish when being picked up or handled. Families with older children who understand the need to always be careful when handling an animal, however, should do fine with the Beveren rabbit. Rabbits are not easy animals to litter train, but it is possible with lots of patience and rewards. Many owners find having several litter boxes spread across the home works well. In terms of toys, most rabbits enjoy having a few of their own trinkets to play and have some fun with. What kind of toy your particular rabbit seems to enjoy, however, depends completely on their personalities. They could fall head-over-feet over something as simple as a few toilet paper rolls strung together with string or can appreciate the value of a mentally stimulating rabbit-safe toy from your local pet store.", "facts": " Mandolin/ Semi-Arch Rabbits for Singles, House Rabbits, Families with older children, Indoor/Outdoor  Rabbits Intelligent, energetic, docile, curious", "tags": "Beveren rabbit, family-friendly rabbit breeds, indoor rabbits, outdoor rabbits, rabbits for seniors, rabbits for singles, "}, "blanc de bouscat": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/blanc-de-bouscat/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blanc-de-bouscat.jpg", "name": "Blanc De Bouscat", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Known initially as the Ermine rabbit, the Blanc De Bouscat rabbit originates from France or, more specifically, the village of Bouscat in Gironde- hence the (revised) name. This giant white rabbit was first bred in 1906, by Mr. and Mrs. Dulon, who set out to create a large-sized rabbit with frosted white fur and red eyes by combining the Flemish Giant with the Champagne d\u2019Argent and French Angora rabbit. Although, at the time, Blanc De Bouscat was bred for its meat and fur, this breed now enjoys a status as one of the most popular pet rabbits in its native country. Blanc De Bouscat is a French \u201cgentle giant\u201d rabbit, distinct for its pure white fur and red eyes. With 13 lb as the weight minimum for the breed and no upper limit, the Blanc De Bouscat rabbit falls into the category of giant breeds. The size of these rabbits is not the only impressive thing about their appearance, though: they have strong, muscular bodies and thick, long ears with rounded tips that they always hold upright. Their body type is semi-arched. The French Angora rabbits were used to create this particular breed, so it\u2019s no surprise that Blanc De Bouscat rabbits have a dense, silky coat that\u2019s particularly soft to the touch. Of normal type and medium length, their fur requires no specific grooming. However, during the molting season, when all rabbits tend to shed more than usual, these giant white bunnies will appreciate a more vigorous brushing routine: it will help keep the hair out of their digestive system- and off your clothes and furniture. Blanc De Bouscat was deliberately bred to have only pure white fur, and apart from some frosty shine on their lustrous coat, you\u2019ll find no patterns, markings, or colorings with this breed. These rabbits are albinos, which means they have red eyes and their hair has no pigmentation whatsoever. These albino bunnies are easy to take care of and make excellent family pets. As a giant rabbit breed, Blanc De Bouscat rabbits require a large and spacious enclosure, where they can hop around freely and comfortably sit and stretch out their strong hind legs: ideally, their cage shouldn\u2019t be less than 3 feet wide and high. Due to their size, these bunnies will benefit from spending some time in the outdoors frequently, so they can roam around and explore the \u201cgreat unknowns\u201d of your backyard. If you don\u2019t have a yard, letting them out to hop around the room is more than fine- anything that allows these rabbits to be active and comfortable. Of course, it should go without saying that your pet rabbit should never be left unsupervised, as it can be hurt by predators or even get lost (these rabbits can jump really high and dig burrows that go underneath the fence). The same goes for indoors- if you haven\u2019t bunny-proofed your home, there are numerous things in your household that could endanger your pet rabbit, from electric cables they could nibble on to poisonous houseplants. When it comes to optimal diet for Blanc De Bouscat rabbits, their nutritional needs are not that much different from most rabbits. Due to their size, they will need more food than most though: high-quality pellets and hay should make the most of its diet. Include various veggies and fruits both as treats and an addition to your bunny\u2019s regular meals. A constant source of fresh water is a must, too. Blanc De Bouscat rabbits are a healthy and robust breed that has no specific health issues or hereditary illnesses. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean these giant white bunnies are immune to diseases and ailments- without proper care, Blanc De Bouscat\u2019s health can deteriorate. They will need a lot of hay in their diet to keep their teeth down to a manageable size (rabbit\u2019s teeth grow throughout their life and need to be ground down with roughage) and to keep their digestive system in check. As avid self-groomers, rabbits tend to scarf down a lot of their own hair during the shedding season, which can lead to a life-threatening condition known as GI stasis. Essentially, the hair can\u2019t be adequately digested and ends up blocking your bunny\u2019s intestines. To avoid this, groom your pet regularly, feed them the right foods, and check for any warning signs such as constipation or poop connected by strands of hair. Lively and affectionate, Blanc De Bouscat rabbits enjoy playing and cuddling with their owners. As an active breed, Blanc De Bouscat rabbits love playtime, but their dynamic nature doesn\u2019t mean these bunnies are restless and nervous. It\u2019s actually the opposite: these gentle giants have a calm and docile demeanor, which makes them a perfect family pet. These rabbits are smart and training them to use the litter or do little tricks will be a rewarding experience. They are fast learners and will cherish the time you spend interacting with them! Affectionate and sweet, these white rabbits love spending time with their owners and don\u2019t mind being petted. They are an excellent choice for children, too: provided that your kids know how to interact with rabbits and don\u2019t attempt picking them up, they\u2019ll enjoy cuddling with this exceptionally well-mannered bunny.", "facts": " Semi-arch/Mandolin Families with older children, First-time owners, Indoor Rabbits, Outdoor Rabbits, House Rabbits Friendly, Sweet, Social, Playful", "tags": "Blanc de Bouscat, family-friendly rabbit breeds, french rabbit breed, giant rabbit breeds, kid-friendly rabbit breeds, social rabbits, sweet rabbits, "}, "blanc de hotot rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/blanc-de-hotot-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/blanc-de-hotot.jpg", "name": "Blanc de Hotot Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Credit for the Blanc de Hotot Rabbit is given to Eugenie Bernhard, chatelaine du Calvados, who is the second woman in history to develop a new rabbit breed. The breed was developed in Hotot-en-Auge, Normandy, where Bernhard goal was to perfect a new breed for meat and fur in 1902. She crossed a Papillon with a White Vienna, as well as a White Flemish Giant, and worked on this breed for 20 years. After crossing over 500 breeds, it wasn\u2019t until 1920 that she showed the perfected breed to the Exposition international d\u2019Aviculture in Paris. In October of 1922, the French officially recognized the breed and it was soon exported to the United States, however they did not last long and soon the Blanc de Hotot no longer existed in the US. The Blanc de Hotot was imported to Switzerland, but because of World War II, the rabbit breed nearly vanished in Europe. In 1978,  Bob Whitman of Texas imported eight Blanc de Hotots from France and showed them. This rabbit breed was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) on March 5, 1979 but is still considered to be a globally endangered breed. Its sweet disposition makes Blanc de Hotot Rabbit great for families looking to have their first pet. This rabbit breed has a large, commercial body shape which weighs anywhere from 8-11 lbs., with does weighing more on the heavier side than bucks. Like most rabbits, they have a small tail and have medium-sized ears that stand erect on their heads. The Blanc de Hotot rabbit has soft, rollback fur that is relatively short, except for the extra-long guard hairs that give the rabbit its frosty sheen. It does not need much maintenance in order to keep it in tip-top shape. Owners and breeders who keep these rabbits as pets, show or fur animals should groom their rabbit with a slicker brush bi-weekly on off-season shedding times and 1-2 times per week when they begin to shed. Blanc de Hotot rabbits are completely white, its eyes are a dark brown and the only marking they should have is a ring around their eyes resembling eyeliner. The eye bands should not be over an eighth of an inch thick, according to ARBA standards. For a well-rounded, friendly Blanc de Hotot rabbit, owners need to take their rabbit out of enclosures and play with them. A well-balanced rabbit diet consists of 70 percent hay, with the remaining 30 percent being leafy greens, fruits, pellets, and vegetables. There are many different kinds of hay available to feed your rabbit, but most owners opt to purchase timothy hay as it has a high percentage of crude protein, calcium and fiber, and is more readily available in stores. Others kinds of acceptable hay to feed your rabbit includes orchard grass, oat hay, meadow hay, or alfalfa. You should also always have water readily available for your rabbit to drink (bottles are preferred to bowls, as bowls can become soiled with food, hay, bedding, etc). The rabbit enclosure can be indoors or out, weather and temperature permitting. Blanc de Hotots do not do well in extreme heat or cold, so always be aware of outdoor conditions before letting your rabbit spend time outside. Outdoor enclosures need protection from the elements and predators (raised wooden enclosures are preferred), while indoor enclosures should be made of wire and have solid bottoms (plastic or metal). Both indoor and outdoor enclosures need bedding on the bottom that should be spot-cleaned every day to keep it as clean as possible, and completely replaced at the end of each week. To have a well-rounded, friendly rabbit, owners need to take the time to bring their rabbit out of their enclosures and play with them. Owners cannot expect to have a friendly rabbit without putting in the effort \u2013 let them explore their surroundings and giving them plenty of love in the form of cuddling and petting their backs, ears and head. Rabbits who are exposed to these conditions will learn to be sweet, affectionate creatures. The Blanc de Hotot rabbit is not susceptible to any hereditary diseases, but there are some things owners need to watch for. Overgrown teeth is by far one of the most common problems. This can be prevented with a well-balanced diet consisting mostly of hay. If your rabbit doesn\u2019t seem to be eating, is less energetic and/or has less droppings than usual, their teeth may be growing into their face and/or jaw. To correct overgrown teeth, take your rabbit to your veterinarian where they can shave down the teeth and prescribe antibiotics for any infection. Those caring for a rabbit should also check their ears periodically (bi-weekly) for any sign of ear mites, as it is also rather common, especially in outdoor rabbits. Flystrike is also another rabbit issue that occurs when flies lay their eggs in a rabbit\u2019s soiled coat (usually on their bottom). When these eggs hatch, their sole source of protein is your rabbit. Lack of appetite, lethargy and/or sudden yelps of agony can be signs of flystrike. Take your rabbit to a veterinarian if you believe it has flystrike, as it could be deadly. Blanc de Hotots exposed to love and affection will become sweet, affectionate pets. Be sure to socialize your rabbit as soon as you can, preferably when it is still a young kit. Socializing your Blanc de Hotot Rabbit means taking the time to bring it out of its enclosure, petting it and introducing it to young children and other animals. Because of their docile natures, rabbits tend to do best when they are the only animal in the house, but they are known to be friendly towards other pets (such as dogs) so long as they grow up with them. Their sweet dispositions make Blanc de Hotots great for families looking to have their first pet as well as for singles, couples or seniors looking for companionship. While they are not known to be overly active, indoor rabbits will enjoy time outside so they can hop about the grass and explore the world around them. Some owners go outside with their rabbits on a leash, as most small dog harnesses fit them perfectly. When it comes to training, rabbits are known to be harder to train that other animals such as cats, dogs or birds. Having said that, it is not completely impossible to potty train, but it is going to be a challenge. Pet owners need to be armed with plenty of patience, time and treats in order to reward them for good behaviors. Some owners have also found success by placing more than one litter box around the home so their rabbit does not have to go far in order to find the proper place to \u201cgo\u201d.", "facts": " Commercial Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors, Apartment/House Rabbits, Families with children, First-time owners, Indoor Rabbits , Outdoor Rabbits Sweet, active, friendly, docile", "tags": "blanc de hotot, endangered rabbits, family-friendly rabbits, rabbits for seniors, rabbits for singles, "}, "brazilian rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/brazilian-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/brazilian-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Brazilian Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Brazilian Rabbit is a popular pet rabbit breed that is native to South America, and it is common in the countryside, as well as suburban districts and market areas, in Brazil. These are considered European domestic rabbits, and it is thought that they were introduced to Brazil by Portuguese sailors. Although there are some breeders in the United Kingdom and in the United States, particularly in Arizona, where a small population of these rabbits has grown since they were introduced in the 1980s by a Peace Corp volunteer who was returning home, this breed is not recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRC) or the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). As a result, this breed is common in Brazil, but rare in other parts of the world. You\u2019ll need to brush your Brazilian Rabbit at least once a week. The shape of Brazilian Rabbit males is the commercial shape, making them stocky and round. Females, on the other hand, feature a mandolin shape, giving them a semi-arch profile. The ears should be large, well furred, and thick, and they are carried upright, open, and forward. A Brazilian Rabbit\u2019s coat will be thick and dense. It will also feature long, coarse guard hairs and fluffy, thick underfur that either stays erect or rolls back slowly when ruffled. You will need to brush your Brazilian Rabbit at least once a week in order to remove loose fur and excess fur. Doing so will prevent matting and keep the coat clean and healthy. Even though the Brazilian Rabbit can feature a variety of colors, the main varieties include self, broken, and Californian. Their coats can be patterned or solid, and colors can include a variety of blue or dilute black shades, such as blue, blue chin, opal, blue frosted white, smoked blue pearl, blue steel, blue fawn, and tortoiseshell. This is because the Brazilian people prefer pastel, bright colors, and this rabbit breed has been fixed for dilution and black pigment. Aside from the Californian pattern, all of these rabbits will have eyes that are hazel to blue-grey in color. The Brazilian Rabbit isn\u2019t recognized by the BRC or the ARBA. Because Brazilian Rabbits, like other rabbit breeds, are herbivorous, you need to provide your pet with a varied diet that consists of hays, such as Timothy hay, and commercial rabbit pellets. Fresh foods, such as leafy greens and other vegetables, as well as some fruits, can also be included in your pet\u2019s diet. This will ensure that your rabbit gets plenty of fiber and nutrients every day. Also provide your pet with fresh, clean water at all times. You can choose to house your Brazilian Rabbit indoors or outside. Housing these rabbits inside your home will protect them from predators, extreme temperatures, and other dangers, but be sure to rabbit-proof your house for your pet\u2019s safety and to keep your belongings from being chewed on. When housing a rabbit indoors, you do need to let him out to exercise and roam, as well as get access to fresh air and sunshine. You can even provide your indoor rabbit with some safe access to the great outdoors with the help of an exercise pen, lawn enclosure, or extension hutch. It is important to know that Brazilian Rabbits could be susceptible to viral infections and colds, so keep your pet away from drafts and sudden temperature changes. You should also do your best to keep your pet\u2019s stress level as low as possible to prevent him from becoming more susceptible to illness. Like other rabbits, Brazilian Rabbits can also become infected with ear mites or develop conjunctivitis, hairball obstructions, bloat, and intestinal problems like coccidiosis. Brazilian Rabbits do best when they are kept in pairs or trios. The Brazilian Rabbit is a popular pet breed because these animals are gentle, friendly, social, and calm. They will get along well with other pets, such as guinea pigs, dogs, and cats, but they do best when they are kept in pairs or trios. Even as adults, they will rarely fight with one another, as they instead prefer snuggling with each other, with other pets, and with their human family. As is the case with other rabbit breeds, you should expect that your Brazilian Rabbit will be most active at sunrise and sunset. These animals can also be stressed easily, and they can be timid and fragile, so they should not be handled by small children.", "facts": " Males are commercial, while females are semi-arch/mandolin Rabbit owners of all experience levels, including families with other pets Gentle, friendly, social, and calm", "tags": "Brazilian Rabbit, european rabbit, rabbit, rabbit breed, "}, "britannia petite rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/britannia-petite-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/britannia-petite-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Britannia Petite Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Britannia Petite rabbit evolved from the Polish rabbit in England in the early 1800s, when showing rabbits for show purposes was popular. This Polish rabbit was exported into the United States in the 1900s, where it remained the same breed (dubbed Polish). In England, breeders started teaching their Polish rabbits the proper way to pose (sitting up on their forefeet, for example), and selective breeding created a rabbit with upright stances and refined bone structure, like we see in the Britannia Petite rabbit today. The breed that Americans call the Britannia Petite is still known as the Polish Rabbit by British Council standards. When these newly developed rabbits with natural poses came to the United States, the name was changed, as the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association already recognized a breed deemed \u201cPolish.\u201d. Many owners enter their Britannia Petite Rabbit into competitive shows where it jumps over obstacles. The Britannia Petite rabbit has a full-arch body type, which means the arch starts at the base of its short neck and continue to the base of the tail. When viewed from the side, it should be a quarter circle,with the rabbit\u2019s belly tucked up beneath it. They have a wedge-shaped head with large eyes that almost look like they are protruding out of their heads. The Britannia Petite rabbit also has short, pointed ears that stand vertically on its head. Not unlike other rabbit breeds, the Britannia Petite\u2019s short, soft coat does not need much care in order to keep it in good condition. They will shed a little bit more than usual twice a year, and if you\u2019re keeping this rabbit as a pet, you will notice an increased amount of stray hairs in your clothes and around your home. To avoid this, simply brush your rabbit outdoors 1-2 times per week with a slicker brush during heavy shedding periods \u2013 otherwise, grooming them once every two weeks should be sufficient. The REW (red-eyed-white) Britannia Petite was the first color to be accepted by the ARBA in 1977, however colors that were also added were developed by judge Rene Godderz. This includes blue-eyed whites and rabbits with broken patterns (white mixed with any other color). However, this breed comes in a variety of other shades such as black, chestnut agouti, black otter and sable. The Britannia Petite rabbit is energetic, so time out of its enclosure is beneficial. A proper diet is one of the most important facets of rabbit ownership. Two things should be given in unlimited amounts to ensure your rabbit is well fed and their health is maintained: fresh water and good-quality hay. Pellets, fresh fruits/vegetables, and leafy greens should only be 25 percent or less of their diet (or even merely given as occasional treats).  Some rabbit-safe vegetables include carrots, fennel, broccoli, and cucumbers and as for fruits, try to only serve your rabbit fruits that are low in sugar (such as apples). Because Britannia Petite Rabbits are so small, they do not require a large enclosure. However, they are much more energetic than other dwarf breeds (such as the Netherland Dwarf) and because of that, you may want to purchase an indoor enclosure that is suitable for a medium-sized rabbit so they have plenty of room to run around. Because of its small size, they are not recommended for outdoor enclosures, as they are easy targets for predators (no matter how strong/durable their enclosures seem to be). Indoor enclosures should be made of wire and have a solid bottom where bedding can be placed. Bedding needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. This little rabbit has a lot of energy to burn and because of that, owners need to make sure they have enough time to take them out of their cages every day. While they are not the most affectionate rabbit breed, they are energetic and won\u2019t stop often for cuddles. The Britannia Petite does not have any health issues particular to its breed, but rabbit owners should check their pets for common problems such as overgrown teeth. Overgrown teeth occur when the rabbit has a poor diet that does not contain enough hay, which slowly grinds their teeth down naturally. If your rabbit suffers from a loss of appetite, has fewer droppings or just doesn\u2019t seem to be itself, be sure to check their mouth for signs of overgrown teeth, which can grow into their jaw or face and be extremely painful. A proper diet is also important to ensure other digestive problems do not occur. For example, if your rabbit develops diarrhea because of a poor diet, their soiled coat can attract flies in the warmer months (especially if it is outdoors). If the rabbit is unable to groom himself properly, flies can lay eggs in his fur (near the bottom). When those eggs hatch, they eat your rabbit \u2013 this is called flystrike. To avoid this, make sure your rabbit eats a balanced diet and check fur for flies. A pea-sized dose of deworming paste twice a year is also recommended to keep your rabbit healthy, and owners should check their rabbit\u2019s ears periodically for ear mites. Because Britannia Petite Rabbits are small, they do not require a large enclosure. Unlike the Netherland Dwarf, the Britannia Petite is not shy or skittish, but they are energetic, which won\u2019t be appealing to those who would like a sweet rabbit to cuddle up to. This rabbit isn\u2019t for first-time owners or seniors, but they would make fantastic pets for those who understand this breed\u2019s nature. Their small size makes them good pets for both homes as well as apartments, so long as the \u201cbunny room\u201d is large enough for your rabbit to safely hop about (rabbit-proofing your entire apartment is easier said than done). Rabbits are notoriously difficult to train, but it is not impossible. Many owners enter their Britannia Petites into competitive shows where they are trained to jump over obstacles. There are plenty of rabbits (Britannia Petites not exclusive) that are taught how to stay, sit and even potty train in their home. With plenty of time, patience and rewards, your rabbit can learn all of these tricks. The Britannia Petite Rabbit needs plenty of outdoor time to bond with its human family. Some enjoy simple toys such as a ball or empty paper towel roll, while others seem to enjoy more complex toys such as those purchased at your local pet store.", "facts": " Full Arch Rabbits for Singles, House Rabbits, Experienced owners, Families with children, Indoor rabbits Excitable, energetic, curious, sweet", "tags": "britannia petite rabbit, obstacle courses, polis rabbit, rabbits for experiences owners, rabbits for families, rabbits for singles, REW, "}, "british giant rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/british-giant-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/british-giant.jpg", "name": "British Giant Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Breeders developed the British Giant Rabbit in the 1940s in the United Kingdom. They began breeding the Flemish Giant that was found in the UK with Flemish Giants that were brought into the area from the United States. Up to that point, the Flemish Giant was only accepted in a single color, which was steel grey, so the breeders used other colors that were coming in from the US in order to create a new breed that would have a wider variety of colors. The British Giant turned out to be smaller than the Flemish Giant, but the breeds are otherwise the same. However, the British Giant is mostly found in the UK and is not considered a popular rabbit breed outside of that part of the world. The British Giant Rabbit is a good choice for families with children. The British Giant Rabbit is a giant breed that could grow to be as large as 15 pounds. These rabbits feature a powerful, large body that is flat across the back but features wide hindquarters and a wide front. The face should be round and broad, and there should be large, erect ears and full cheeks. The fur of a British Giant Rabbit will be medium in length, soft, and dense. You should groom this rabbit regularly in order to keep the fur in top condition, as well as to prevent it from matting. The British Giant Rabbit was bred to showcase a variety of colors, and those include steel grey, opal, sable, white, blue, and black. The British Giant Rabbit makes a wonderful family pet and house rabbit. Because the British Giant Rabbit is so large, you will need to provide your pet with a large enclosure and space to exercise and play. Purchase a hutch that is an appropriate size for your rabbit\u2019s body, or you could opt for a Wendy house or a dedicated shed. When housed outside, make sure your rabbit is kept away from full sun and wind. Your pet\u2019s outdoor hutch should also be weatherproof and waterproof. Always ensure your pet has a safe area where he can sunbathe and explore. This is also one of the best rabbit breeds to house indoors because these animals are so good-natured, affectionate, and calm. However, your rabbit will want to chew on things, such as shoes and furnishings, so rabbit-proof your home and keep an eye on him while he is outside of his cage. Also provide your indoor rabbit with a safe and quiet area where he could rest without being disturbed. You can use a dog crate that has a plastic bottom, and you can provide your pet with a variety of toys. British Giants are considered to be generally hardy. However, because of the breed\u2019s size, sore feet and back problems, as well as other ailments, might arise. These pets are also prone to becoming obese. Overweight rabbits will have trouble caring for themselves and grooming themselves, and they could become vulnerable to fly strike. Therefore, it\u2019s important to ensure your rabbit maintains the ideal weight throughout his life. Dental problems can also develop in a British Giant Rabbit, as the teeth constantly grow and could become overgrown quickly. The best way to prevent these problems is by giving your pet the right foods that will help wear the teeth down properly. These include fibrous green veggies and hays that require quite a bit of chewing. The British Giant Rabbit could grow to be as large as 15 pounds. The British Giant Rabbit makes a wonderful family pet and house rabbit, as the breed is known for being gentle, easy going, and docile. These rabbits are also litter trainable, so observe where your pet prefers to go to the bathroom and put a tray in that area so that he will learn how to use it. Use a wood pellet based litter rather than clay litter. British Giants will get along well with children and other pets, including dogs and cats, especially when introduced at a early age. They are not too active, and they enjoy lounging and relaxing, but you should still provide your pet with some playtime. When handled consistently and from an early age, these rabbits become affectionate and will thoroughly enjoy snuggling with you. They thrive on human interaction and affection, so you should have the time to devote to this pet if you are planning on bringing one home. Although these rabbits are a good choice for families with children, you should teach your kids how to gently and safely handle your rabbit, as well as how to behave around rabbits so that they don\u2019t become frightened or stressed.", "facts": " Semi-Arch/Mandolin Singles, families with children and other pets, and seniors who are living in a house with space for a large rabbit Relaxed, easygoing, friendly, affectionate, docile, gentle, social", "tags": "british giant, british giant rabbit, british rabbit, family rabbit, flemish giant, Flemish Giant Rabbit, flemish rabbit, giant rabbit, giant rabbit breed, house rabbit, rabbit breed, "}, "californian rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/californian-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/californian-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Californian Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Californian Rabbit breed was developed in the 1923 by George West of California. His plan was to develop a breed with the \u201cperfect\u201d meat as well as a dense, desirable coat. After five years of breeding, he developed a small, chinchilla-colored male by crossing a Himalayan white with Chinchillas. The buck was bred with several of West\u2019s New Zealand rabbits to increase their size, and so the Californian Rabbit was born. West gave a few of his stock to two trusted Southern California breeders and together, they perfected the breed. The Californian rabbit was first shown as a breed in 1928, its first appearance at an American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) convention in 1932 and became a recognized breed in 1939. Today, Californian rabbits are only surpassed in popularity by the New Zealand whites. \u2028The Californian Rabbit makes a great pet because of its mild temperament. This rabbit breed has a commercial body type and should ideally weigh between 8-11 lbs. They also have a muscular body with full shoulders and hindquarters, which are as deep as they are wide. Their coat is usually completely white with Himalayan-like markings. Their ears are broad and medium in length, and should point straight up. The Californian rabbit breed\u2019s coat is dense and coarse and not soft, so petting them probably feels better for the rabbit than for a human. Its fur is short and the undercoat should be dense. You may find they tend to shed its coat more in the spring than other season of the year. To keep as much of their fur out of your home as possible, simply groom them with a bristled brush outdoors 1-2 times per week when they are shedding the most. Otherwise, once a week or once every two weeks should be more than enough. The only color accepted by the ARBA when it comes to Californian rabbits is white with markings as dark as possible.  They have black/near-black markings on their nose, feet, ears and tail and must have pink eyes (like that of an albino rabbit). Californian Rabbits do well with human interaction and also make excellent pets. In order to see their personalities blossom, the Californian rabbit needs plenty of time outside of its enclosure to explore and form a lasting bond with human families. Despite being used mainly as a show or meat rabbit, they do well with human interaction and can make excellent pets. This particular breed does well either in indoor or outdoor enclosures, as their coat is dense enough to handle cold temperatures (even with snow), so long as their outdoor enclosures are protected from the elements (sun, rain, snow). Outdoor enclosures should also be covered on three sides to protect rabbits from cold drafts in the winter, as well as provide ventilation and shade at the same time during the hotter months. Indoor enclosures should be made of wire, be large enough for them to stretch out in and have a plastic bottom. The bottom should be laid with good-quality bedding (some owners like using small amounts of horse bedding, which is perfectly acceptable), should be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced every week. Like with any rabbit, their diet should mainly be made up of high-quality hay (timothy hay is a great example). Seventy percent should be hay with the rest being high-quality pellets, vegetables, leafy greens, and fruits.  Fruits and vegetables can also be used as incentives or treats to reward your bunny whenever they complete a task or obey a command (such as sitting, staying, or using their litter box). Adult rabbits can eat about 1/4 cup of high-fiber pellets everyday for every 5 lbs. they weigh and always make sure to research what kind of fruit/leafy green/vegetable you\u2019re planning on feeding them, as some are not recommended for rabbits. The Californian rabbit does not have any particular disease of health issue, but it can develop sore hocks should they be kept in an enclosure with a wire bottom (which is not recommended for any rabbit, for that matter). Having said that, rabbits are susceptible to a few problems which differ from cats or dogs. Should you keep your rabbit mostly outdoors, for example, flystrike can happen, especially in hotter months. This occurs when flies lay their eggs in soiled parts of your rabbit\u2019s fur (mostly near their bottoms) and once the eggs hatch, their main source of food is your rabbit while it still lives. This causes excruciating pain for your rabbit and can even be lethal \u2013 be sure to take your rabbit to your local vet to get them treated should you suspect this is happening. Also check your rabbit\u2019s mouth every two weeks or so for overgrown teeth, as rabbit\u2019s teeth never stop growing. Should their diet be low in hay, teeth can continue to grow into their faces and jaws, which can also be very painful. Thankfully, veterinarians can usually treat any infection due to overgrown teeth and can also shave those teeth down to a manageable length. Finally, every rabbit should also be periodically checked for ear mites, as it is a common problem especially among rabbits who are mostly kept outdoors. Californian rabbits need plenty of time outside of their enclosures to explore and form a lasting bond with their human families. While mostly bred as meat or show animals, many love having the Californian as a pet rabbit because of their mild temperament. While they may seem shy and sometimes even quiet, with proper socialization (which means lots of time outside of their enclosure, interacting with their human families), their personalities will bloom and you will soon find out that your Californian loves to play and be active but also loves to sit back and cuddle when the time is right.  This makes them great first-time pets for couples, singles, seniors or families with children of any age, so long as they are careful when holding or petting the rabbit. Always make younger children sit on the ground when they are petting rabbit (even ones as large as this one), as if they happen to fall or flip over, they won\u2019t get as hurt since they are already near the ground. Like most rabbits, your Californian should be given a couple of toys to make sure they aren\u2019t bored, as boredom can lead to the destruction of your personal property such as shoes, your room\u2019s baseboard and basically anything else that they can sink their teeth into (much like puppies).  Toys can include a few balls, a paper towel roll or anything that is bunny-safe purchased from your local pet store. Unlike other pets such as dogs and cats, rabbits are a little bit tricker to litter train. With lots of time, patience and rewards, rabbits can be potty trained but it takes much longer than other pets. Instead of using just one litter box, try to spread a couple around the house so they won\u2019t be tempted to do it in a corner because they cannot hold it in. When rabbit parents find that their bunny tends to do their business where they are not supposed to (such as their favorite corner in the living room), they put a litter box in that particular area and sometimes, that is enough to make the rabbit understand that this is where they need to do the deed.", "facts": " Commercial singles, seniors, apartment/house, families with children, first-time owners indoor/outdoor  Docile, affectionate, gentle, energetic", "tags": "affectionate rabbit breeds, Californian Rabbit, rabbits for families, show rabbits, "}, "cashmere lop": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/cashmere-lop/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cashmere-lop.jpg", "name": "Cashmere Lop", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Cashmere Lop is a newer breed that was discovered within the nest of Dwarf Lop rabbits by Miss Turner of Wales in 1980. She realized that there was something different about a few of the kits within the nest, as some of them had thicker, longer, and more luxurious coats than the rest. Six years later, the Cashmere Lop started gaining popularity. By the middle of the \u201890s, the breed began appearing in shows, gaining a bigger audience, and breeders started working on developing the breed so that it could get standardized. When the National Cashmere Lop Club was founded, it recognized the breed in every color, and the breed is still popular and found in shows around the world. The Cashmere Miniature was first seen about a decade later and the breed was eventually standardized in all colors. The Cashmere Lop Standard and the Cashmere Mini are recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRC), but not by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). The coat of the Cashmere Lop is silky, long, and thick. The Cashmere Lop features a compact, firm, and thickset shape. The body, which is powerful despite being small, is described as broad, well muscled, and short, and there is little neck visible. The rump is also well muscled, well rounded, and short, while the chest is deep and broad. This rabbit\u2019s front legs should be straight, short, and thick, while the hind legs will be powerful, strong, and short, as well as carried parallel with the body. The breed\u2019s tail is also well furred and strong. The head is broad, bold, and strong, and the cheeks are well developed. The ears should be well furred, long, rounded at the ends, thick, and broad, and they\u2019re carried close to the head. The insides of the rabbit\u2019s delicate ears shouldn\u2019t be visible from any angle. The eyes are bright and bold and the crown is prominent across the skull. The coat of the Cashmere Lop is silky, long, and thick. It should be about 1.5 to 2 inches in length, but it should lie beautifully on the animal\u2019s body. This rabbit\u2019s fur should not be woolly. The topcoat is heavier and longer than the undercoat. Because of their unique coat, these rabbits do require more work than other breeds, especially while they\u2019re young. Until your rabbit is roughly 5 months old, his coat will have a tendency to become matted and knotted, so regular grooming sessions will be necessary using a wire comb suitable for longhaired cats and dogs. When grooming your Cashmere Lop, you shouldn\u2019t comb out all of the density from the undercoat. Don\u2019t use a comb to thin the coat out; instead, use it to gently break tangles and mats apart. Once your Cashmere Lop is an adult, you should groom him weekly, as well as trim his nails. Pluck out tangles and dead hairs to keep the coat beautiful and keep your pet comfortable. The Cashmere Lop showcases all possible colors. These include the self colors, which are ruby-eyed white, blue-eyed white, lilac, chocolate, blue, and black, as well as the agouti colors, which are Chinchilla, lynx, cinnamon, opal, squirrel, and agouti. Other possible colors include the tan colors, which are marten sable, fox and otters (blue, lilac, chocolate, and black), and marten smoke. You will also find these rabbits in shaded colors, including iron grey, seal point, Isabella, blue point, Siamese smoke, sooty fawn, and Siamese sable. And you will even find Cashmere Lops in any other variety of colors, such as chocolate tort, steel, orange, fawn, and butterfly. Cashmere Lops make great family pets. You can house your Cashmere Lop in a secure environment inside your home or apartment or in your garden. If you are going to set up an outdoor hutch, it should be waterproof and weatherproof, and it should be placed in area that is out of direct sunlight and wind. On the other hand, an indoor rabbit can be trained to use a litter tray, and he can have a crate or cage that he can use to rest in. Your Cashmere Lop should have access to fresh, clean water at all times, and he can be fed rabbit pellets, a variety of hay, some fruit, and fibrous vegetables, such as kale, dandelions, and cabbage. The Cashmere Lop is a breed that is generally hardy. Like other breeds, this rabbit\u2019s teeth will grow continuously, so you should provide him with foods like fibrous green veggies and hay to wear the teeth down and keep them from overgrowing. Another common issue is flystrike, which is more likely to occur if your rabbit is overweight and can\u2019t groom himself. You can also have your pet vaccinated against VHD and myxomatosis, and you can treat your rabbit for ticks, fleas, and worms. Cashmere Lops are intelligent and can even learn their names. Cashmere Lops and Mini Cashmere Lops are great family pets, as they get along well with adults and older children. These animals are engaging, bright, and smart. They will greet the humans that they learn to recognize, and they can even learn their names. Many enjoy being stroked and held as well. Plus, you can train your pet to use the litter tray.

This rabbit, known as the French Silvers in France, were exported in large quantities to England around 1920 and were dubbed the Argente de Champagne. They were also exported to America circa 1912, but had long, loose coats such as that of a silver fox (the dog). The color and length of their coat was improved and the standard became a short, soft coat. This new breed was developed to be larger than the French or English Champagne Argenetes, weighing up to 12 lbs. The \u201ce\u201d was dropped in the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association  (ARBA) Standard of Perfection between 1955-1959 and most breeders simply abbreviate the breed\u2019s name to \u201cChampagne\u201d. The Champagne d\u2019Argent\u2019s silver coat doesn\u2019t come in until it is 6-8 months old. The Champagne d\u2019Argent rabbit has a commercial body shape which can weigh between 9-12 lbs. once fully grown. They have full shoulders, deep hindquarters and medium- to long-sized ears which usually stand on the halfway mark between their heads and their backs. Like most rabbit breeds, the Champagne d\u2019Argent rabbit will also go through a seasonal molt (much like a dog when it sheds in the Spring) and during that time, you will have to groom them a little more often than usual. When they go through molts, you can expect to have your clothes full of their fur when you pick them up and give them some loving, which is why daily brushing during molts is a must. Otherwise, one brushing a week should be sufficient. Under no circumstances should you give your rabbit a bath, as this stresses the out greatly and may result in their death. Simply spot-clean your rabbit with a damp cloth to rid their coats of any impurities. When Champagne d\u2019Argent kits are born, they are usually all black; their silver color will develop once they mature. The silver color starts at the belly and travels up, finishing up over the back and face when they are 6-8 months old, and will continue to lighten as they grow older. Due to color variations depending on their age, they will have black guard hairs with a light silver color overall. Their ears and noses are usually darker than the rest of their bodies once they are fully grown. The Champagne d\u2019Argent rabbit does well with other rabbits and also enjoy human attention. Like any other breed of rabbit, the Champagne D\u2019Argent rabbit requires a diet consisting of at least 70 percent hay. The rest of their diet is made up a healthy balance of pellets, leafy greens, fruits, and vegetables. Be aware of what kind of leafy greens you feed your rabbit, as some of them (like iceberg lettuce) don\u2019t contain enough vitamins or nutrients and, contain landanum, which can be harmful in large quantities. Also be careful of what kind of vegetables you decide to feed your rabbit, as some of them are harmful (such as beans, cabbage, potatoes, etc) and other fruits contain too much sugar to be healthy for them. This rabbit can either live indoors or out, depending on what they are being bred for and year-round weather conditions. Because this breed is used for show, meat and fur purposes, outdoor enclosures need to be protected from the elements and other predators, and should be made of either wood or wire. Both indoor and outdoor rabbit enclosures need to have a solid bottom in order to place bedding, which should be spot-cleaned everyday and completely replaced at the end of every week. As always, enclosures need to be large enough for your rabbit to stretch out to their full length, plus have some space leftover so they can hop around and explore. If you\u2019re keeping the Champagne d\u2019Argent rabbit as a pet, it will need to be socialized so it grows up to be well-rounded and friendly. This means taking them out of their enclosures when they are young kits to cuddle, pet and allow them to explore their indoor room. This will ensure that your rabbit is affectionate and socialized to other animals, adults and small children once they are fully grown. The Champagne d\u2019Argent is not susceptible to any specific disease, however there are many common problems that can occur if it doesn\u2019t receive proper care. Cages should always be made of galvanized steel and have a separate section where droppings will not get caught in their fur, because of the risk of flystrike. Flystrike is an extremely painful condition that can often leave your rabbit immobilized or even result in death. Rabbit teeth keep growing throughout its entire life at a rate of one centimeter a month. Its teeth are designed to wear down when its eats grass, hay and even the occasional blocks of wood. Always monitor your rabbit\u2019s teeth to make sure they are not overgrowing, as they can grow into their face and/or into their jawbone if they do not wear down properly. Lastly, do give your rabbit a routine ear check-up at home to make sure that no ear mites are present. Ear mites initially start off as scaling and then progress into a thick crust that builds up in their ears. If you find ear mites in your rabbit\u2019s ears, consult your veterinarian as soon as possible for treatment options. Champagne d\u2019Argents need to be socialized on a daily basis so they grow to be well-rounded and friendly rabbits. Champagne d\u2019Argent rabbits do well with other rabbits and also enjoy human attention, so long as they are socialized early on. Their temperament is comparable to a well-mannered cat \u2013 they will nap in a little corner of your home and will greet you at their cage door to be petted. While they are not the most active rabbit, Champagnes will happily hop around their indoor room and like to spend some time outdoors. These rabbits are large enough to have a medium-sized dog harness attached to them, so long as they are comfortable. Unlike other pets such as dogs and cats, rabbits are a little bit tricker to litter train. With lots of time, patience and rewards, rabbits can be potty trained, but it takes much longer than other pets. Instead of using just one litter box, try to spread a couple around the house so they won\u2019t be tempted to do it in a corner. When owners find that their rabbits tend to do their business where they are not supposed to (such as their favorite corner in the living room), they put a litter box in that particular area and that is enough to make the rabbit understand that this is where they need to do the deed. When it comes to toys, every rabbit has their own individual personality and you will find that while one Champagne adores playing with a ball, the other may not pay it any mind. Some rabbits enjoy more complex toys that can be purchased at your local pet store, while others are perfectly content with an empty paper towel tube. It really depends on each rabbit\u2019s individual personality.", "facts": " Commercial Singles, seniors, indoor/outdoor, house rabbits, Families with older children, First-time owners Gentle, affectionate, curious", "tags": "argenete rabbit, champagne d'argent, gentle rabbit breeds, rabbits for seniors, silver coat, sweet rabbits, "}, "checkered giant rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/checkered-giant-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/checkered-giant.jpg", "name": "Checkered Giant Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The origin of the Checkered Giant breed is disputed, but it\u2019s believed that this rabbit first made an appearance in 1800 either in France or Germany when Flemish Giants, French Lops and spotted rabbits were bred together to create a breed called \u201cLand Kaninchen.\u201d This breed was about 10-12 lbs and did not have the markings we know today\u2019s Checkered Giant to have. They continued to breed them with Flemish Giants throughout Germany to increase their size, eventually making the \u201cLorraine rabbit\u201d, sometimes called the \u201cGreat German Spotted rabbit.\u201d In 1904, a gentleman by the name of Mr. Otto Reinhardt of Reinfalz, Germany, bred the Great German Spotted rabbit to a black Flemish Giant, which produced the Checkered Giant we know today. They arrived a mere six years later onto American soil and shortly after, the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) accepted the Checkered Giant as a recognized breed. The Checkered Giant was first known as the Land Kaninchen. The Checkered Giant has a slender yet muscular build and have a long, hare-like body with a semi-arched/mandolin body type. They have long, powerful legs, a wide head and broad ears that should be upright most of the time. This particular breed of rabbit has soft short- to medium-length fur which is soft and easy to maintain. Most rabbits will clean themselves (as they are rather clean animals), however they are known to shed more in particular times of the year. If you keep your rabbit as an indoor pet, you\u2019ll want to groom them once every week or every other week during shedding season in order to have the least amount of fur possible flying inside your home. The Checkered Giant is one of the few ARBA recognized breeds that has distinctive markings. The only color that the ARBA accepts is white with either blue or black markings resembling a butterfly across the nose. They also have two black or blue spots on either side of the body with a black or blue stripe running along from the base of their ears to their tail over the spine. Checkered Giants are mostly used for show, but they can also make wonderful pets. Due to this rabbit\u2019s size, they need a rather large enclosure to keep them comfortable while their human family is not in the home. This means having a cage that is at least 3 ft x 3 ft x 4 ft., and make sure that you rabbit can easily stretch out at the bottom of their cage. Enclosures should be made of wire and have a solid bottom (such as plastic or metal), as sores are easily made when rabbits lay on a wire-bottom cage for too long so for their safety and comfort, make sure to purchase a wire cage with a solid bottom. The bottom should also be lined with hay (horse hay is acceptable) and should be spot-cleaned for faeces every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. These rabbits do well either indoors or outdoors, but be sure that outdoor enclosures are covered from the elements (sun and rain), but also provide enough draft to keep them cool during warmer temperatures. Should the temperatures raise or drop too much, be sure to bring them indoors. A Checkered Giant\u2019s diet is not unlike any other pet rabbit in that it should consist of 70 percent good-quality hay. The rest of their diet should be a healthy mix of pellets, vegetables and fruits, but they should be given these sparingly. Fresh water and hay should be readily available to your rabbit at all times. If you\u2019re unsure, the easiest thing is not to feed it to them. Some surprising foods that are actually dangerous to rabbits include onions, leeks, chives, and mustard greens. Contrary to popular belief, you should not feed your rabbit most types of lettuces, as they contain lactucarium, which will give your rabbit diarrhoea. There are plenty of other leafy greens and vegetables that you can feed your rabbit such as parsnips, watercress, Brussel sprouts and fennel. These rabbits are mostly used for show rather than for meat purposes, but they can also make wonderful pets as long as they are given plenty of human affection and lots of outdoor playtime. Indoor rabbits need to have lots of time out of their enclosures in a bunny-safe room, which means everything and anything that could harm your rabbit is out of sight (electrical cords, for example). Unlike most animals, rabbit teeth never stop growing. Thankfully, they are also constantly being worn down by everyday activities such as chewing their food, like hay. If your rabbit\u2019s teeth are not being worn down, their teeth may start growing into their jaw and face, causing severe pain. Signs of overgrown teeth or an infection due to overgrown teeth include loss of appetite, sluggish activity or drooling. Be sure to check your rabbit\u2019s mouth weekly for signs of overgrown teeth and bring it to the vet if you suspect it has an infection caused by overgrown teeth. Vets can treat both the infection with antibiotics as well as shave down their teeth to a manageable length. Ears should also regularly be checked for ear mites, as this is a common condition in rabbits, especially those who are mostly outdoors. In order to protect them from worms, be sure to also give your rabbit a pea-sized amount of de-worming paste every spring and fall. Rabbits can be spayed and neutered and if you find your rabbit to be particularly aggressive, this can help calm them down. Does (female rabbits) can be spayed between 4-6 months of age (depending on how early your local vet can safely do the procedure) and bucks (male rabbits) can be neutered when they are just 3 1/2 months old. The Checkered Giant has a slender yet muscular build and a long, hare-like body with a semi-arched/mandolin body type. This breed of rabbit isn\u2019t as affectionate as other breeds, but that\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t a gentle breed. They enjoy human interaction even when they are used for breeding/show purposes. The Checkered Giant would make a good pet for those looking for a sweet companion, but isn\u2019t as cuddly or needy as other rabbit breeds. This breed does well with singles, couples or seniors who have a large enough home and backyard to keep it happy and healthy. They also do well with families with older children, as young children may not be able to hold them properly (as they are on the larger side of rabbits), and also may drop them more easily than medium-sized rabbits. Rabbits are arguably harder to potty train than other animals such as cats or dogs. Rabbits usually have a \u201cpotty corner\u201d in their enclosure where they usually like to do the deed so if you place a litter box in that particular corner, they will generally make the connection and slowly understand that is where they are supposed to do their business. Some owners have found success by placing many litter boxes around their homes. Always approach potty training with lots of patience, time and treats to reward your rabbit when they have successfully completed a task (apple slices are great rabbit treats). In order to keep most of your possessions as bite-free as possible, ensure your rabbit has a few toys it can gnaw at. This can mean something as simple as a few toilet paper rolls to as lavish as a mentally stimulating rabbit-safe toy from your local pet store.", "facts": " Semi-Arch/Mandolin Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors, House Rabbits, Families with children, Indoor/Outdoor Rabbits Curious, gentle, sweet, active", "tags": "Checkered Giant Rabbit, giant checkered, Land Kaninchen, rabbits for couples, rabbits for seniors, "}, "cinnamon rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/cinnamon-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cinnamon-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Cinnamon Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Back in the 1960s, a Chinchilla Doe was given to a Montana girl named Belle Houseman as a gift. Soon after, her brother obtained a New Zealand buck and the two rabbits mated. The children began raising purebred rabbits but every once in a while, their father allowed them to crossbreed as well. When a Checkered Giant and a Californian rabbit were mixed in, the first Cinnamon-colored rabbit was born. J. Cyrol Lowett, a well-known judge at the time, suggested they solely breed this kind of rabbits and soon, it developed into its own separate group known as the Cinnamon Rabbit breed. They are good-looking rabbits who are very much show-worthy because of their stunning coat. The Cinnamon rabbit is a medium-sized rabbit weighing no more than 9 pounds when they become full-fledged adults. They are good-looking rabbits who are very much show-worthy because of their stunning coat. Most of their bodies are covered in a beautiful ground cinnamon-colored, short fur with their nose, ears, belly and paws a smoky grey/black color. Their heads are proportional to their bodies and they have vertical ears which can grow to be as long as four inches. The Cinnamon rabbit\u2019s fur is beautiful and rather rare, which makes them a joy to pet and lets them steal the spotlight in rabbit shows, plus they are relatively calm, docile creatures \u2013 perfect as pets! The Cinnamon rabbit\u2019s coat is short and relatively easy to maintain. Weekly or biweekly grooming with a slicker brush should be sufficient for the most part, excluding shedding season. During shedding season, you\u2019ll have to increase your brushings to twice a week to maintain this rabbit\u2019s soft fur. Cinnamon rabbits have a light brown color like the hue of ground cinnamon, with smoky gray shading around the ears, snout and paws. They do not come in any other colors. Cinnamon rabbits are relatively calm, docile creatures \u2013 perfect as pets! These rabbits are relatively easy to care for and mostly groom themselves and each other (although weekly or bi-weekly grooming should be scheduled). As aforementioned, you should increase the amount of grooming to twice per week when shedding season starts along to keep their fur in tip-top shape. In terms of bedding, most of these rabbits do well with wood pellets or aspen. If you also have a horse, the pelleted horse bedding can double as your Cinnamon rabbit\u2019s bedding as well. Steer clear of pine or cedar bedding as this can affect your rabbit\u2019s liver and there is also a risk of developing cancer. Because they are herbivores, the Cinnamon rabbit enjoys a wide array of different foods in their diet. They like wet food, carrots, other fresh vegetables, hay or dark leaf lettuce. Limit the amount of fruits that have high levels of sugar. However, their diet should still consist of 70 percent hay and always have fresh water at their disposal. Make sure to stay clear of iceberg lettuce, as it contains too much water and too little fiber to count as a good meal. And don\u2019t feed your rabbit yard clippings, as grass is usually treated with fertilizer, insecticides, pesticides and other chemicals that can harm your rabbit. The Cinnamon rabbit is not particularly susceptible to any specific disease; however there are many common problems that can occur if one does not take proper care of them. Cages should always be made of galvanized steel and should have a separate part where droppings will not get caught in their fur, as problems such as flystrike can occur. Flystrike is an extremely painful condition that can often leave your bunny immobilized in agony or even result in death if their cages are not properly tended after. Rabbits often have pristine teeth that keep growing throughout their entire lives at a rate of 1 centimeter a month. Their teeth are designed to wear down when they eat grass, hay and even the occasional blocks of wood. Always monitor your rabbit\u2019s teeth to make sure they are not overgrowing, as they can grow into their face and/or into their jawbone if it does not wear down properly. Lastly, do give your rabbit a routine ear check-up at home to make sure that no ear mites are present. Ear mites initially start off as scaling and then progresses into a thick crust that builds up in their ears. If you find ear mites in your bunny\u2019s ears, consult your local veterinarian as soon as you can because treatment success rates increase the earlier it is caught. Cinnamon rabbits are great bunnies for first-time pet owners or for families with children. Due to their calm, docile nature, Cinnamon rabbits are great bunnies for first-time pet owners or for parents who would like to see their child grow into the responsibility of becoming a pet caregiver. They start off as small as your hand and grow into a rather large bunny. Compared to other pets, they are relatively easy to maintain and will live a long, healthy life if they are taken care of properly. Unlike some bunnies, the Cinnamon rabbit does well with having another bunny of the same breed for companionship, as happy rabbits tend to live longer when they have someone to keep them company. However, if your bunny is not spayed, be wary of breeding \u2013 Cinnamon rabbits can produce about 2-4 litters of bunnies per year with litters of 4-6 babies. These rabbits also love to jump and run, reaching speeds up 30-40 miles per hour, so having a fenced backyard where you can let your bunny roam free is recommended.  When they aren\u2019t bouncing around and having a wonderful time, they\u2019ll enjoy some peace and quiet with their human companion. They\u2019ll also benefit from having a couple of toys to choose from to sink their teeth into and play with. Because they are so friendly and calm, they usually do not have a problem being petted or even picked up by any stranger who happens to fall in love with your Cinnamon.", "facts": " Commercial Families with or without children living in a house, first-time owners Docile, calm, curious, friendly", "tags": "Active rabbits, calm rabbit, Cinnamon Rabbit, ear mites, Flystrike, friendly rabbits, shedding, soft rabbit fur, "}, "columbia basin pygmy rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/columbia-basin-pygmy-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/columbia-basin-pygmy-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit is an isolated population of Brachylagus idahoensis (Pygmy Rabbit) that is native to a single area in Washington state. As the name suggests, these rabbits are best known for their miniature size- adult Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit usually weighs less than 1 lb. Pygmy rabbits have lived in the Great Basin area of the western U.S for the last 100,000 years, but at least 10,000 years ago glacial movements made the Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit completely separated from the rest of its close relatives, which led to genetic differences that make this breed one of a kind.  Sadly, these tiny bunnies are near extinct, and federally listed as an endangered species. In 2001, the last 16 rabbits that were living in the wild were collected by biologists from Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife, and transported to various breeding programs across the country, in efforts to preserve the unique breed. Even though the last genetically pure Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit, named Bryn, has passed away in 2009, the conservation efforts were not in vain, as her offspring is now repopulating their native habitats. Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits are the smallest rabbits in the world, and can easily fit in a palm of one\u2019s hand. Apart from their petite size, Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits are easily recognizable by their round, compact bodies and small ears. When fully grown, these rabbits weigh no more than 1lb and are around 9 to 11 inches long. The females of the species are slightly larger than the males. Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits have short and strong legs and can hop at speed up to 15 miles per hour, and big claws that help them dig burrows. Their tail is short and almost entirely hidden. Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits have a soft, fluffy fur. Their coat helps them maintain a constant internal temperature, which means it is supposed to protect them from harsh weather and extreme temperatures. During the winter season, their fur is denser and thicker, and after molting, slicker and more lightweight in the summer months. Not unlike all undomesticated rabbits, Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits come only in one, grayish-brown color. In the winter, their hair appears to be grayer with a pinkish tinge, while in the summer it turns to brownish hues. Of course, since they are wild rabbits, they don\u2019t have a uniform standard, but there are rarely any variations present. In some specimens, light spots near the nostrils can be present, as well as whitish around the margins of their ears. These rabbits have soft, grayish-brown fur. In addition to their recognizable looks, these rabbits have another unique trait- they are the only rabbits native to the United States that dig their own burrows. In the wild, these tiny rabbits are prey to numerous predators, and digging hiding holes is essential to their survival. Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits also use dens to protect their young, by burying their litters in nests (shallow burrows). The mothers come back once a day to nurse their kits, which stay in the burrows until they are old enough to roam around with their parents, which is usually when they\u2019re about two weeks of age.  This particular breed has adapted to the life in the sagebrush prairie desert, and the bitter plant makes up most of their diet, as well as provides shelter. During the colder months of the year, the Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit\u2019s diet consists almost exclusively of sagebrush leaves, and makes up more than half of their food in the summer, along with grass. Although there are no particular hereditary illnesses or breed-specific diseases that endanger the Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits, there are a few factors that led to their near extinction. The lose of their natural habitat, due to clearings, developments and fires, is one of the main reasons why these tiny bunnies were all but wiped out from existence. Even in ideal conditions, their life expectancy is 3 to 5 years, because their size makes them easy prey for predators. The mortality rate for adult specimens is a staggering 88%. The reproduction rate of Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits makes things even harder. Unlike most of their relatives, these petite rabbits are not prolific breeders. To ensure the survival of the species, they were crossed with other pygmy rabbits in the conservation breeding programs, which significantly helped preserve them. Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits that have been reintroduced to the wild are hybrids and have approximately 75% of their original genetic makeup. These wild rabbits are timid, skittish, and unaccustomed to humans. Considering their small size and harsh life in the wilderness, it\u2019s not surprising that these rabbits are quite timid and skittish. They never stray far from their burrows, so much so that they are never more than 200 yards away from them. Due to the diminished numbers and limited research, there is still much that remains a mystery about the behavior and lives of these fascinating miniature rabbits. As an endangered, wild breed, Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbits are not suitable as pets. If you are looking for tiny, cute bunnies that make ideal pets, consider dwarf rabbit breeds such as Netherland Dwarf Rabbit, Jersey Wolly Rabbit, or Polish Rabbit.", "facts": " Compact Outdoor Shy, timid, skittish", "tags": "Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit, Dwarf rabbit, dwarf rabbit breeds, endangered rabbits, wild rabbit, wild rabbit breed, "}, "continental giant rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/continental-giant-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/continental-giant.jpg", "name": "Continental Giant Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "One of the oldest and largest rabbit breeds, experts suggest that the Continental Giant dates back to the middle of the 16th century. Many of these rabbits are descendants of the Flemish Giant from Belgium, but this breed also shares a heritage with other breeds, such as the Belgian Hare. However, it was not until 1893 that the first standards for Continental Giant Rabbits were written. In the late 19th century, Continental Giants and Flemish Giants were sent to the United States from Europe and Britain in an effort to increase the size of rabbits that were being used for meat. As a result, Giant rabbit breeds were seen at small livestock shows, and they became popular as pet rabbits as well because they were naturally docile. There are actually two varieties of the Continental Giant Rabbit, and they are the White Continental and the Colored Continental. Although the breed is recognized by the British Rabbit Council, it is not recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders\u2019 Association. You might have also come across the name Conti- which is an accepted nickname given to this majestic rabbit breed by their loving owners.  The Continental Giant is of the oldest and largest rabbit breeds. Because the Continental Giant is a rabbit that features a semi-arch body type, the arch of the back will start at the shoulders and continue to the base of the tail, giving the animal a mandolin shape. The body of this breed will also be powerful and long, and there will be muscular and broad hindquarters, but the underline of the Continental Giant\u2019s body should not feature a hare-like arch. The front legs should be sturdy, straight, and well-proportioned. Males will feature a wide and large head that is larger than the head of females. Also, females will have an evenly spread and pronounced dewlap. The eyes on both males and females should be wide open, bright, and round, and the ears should be thick, robust, held upright, well covered, rounded, and long. The length of the ears should be roughly 25% of the length of the body. And you will also notice that the cheeks are well developed. A Continental Giant\u2019s fur will be glossy, dense, and thick. There will be guard hairs visible, and the undercoat will be soft and abundant, with a good amount of density as well. You will need to groom your rabbit regularly in order to keep the coat healthy. Also, large rabbit breeds sometimes have trouble keeping themselves clean, particularly when they get older, so you will need to take steps to ensure your Continental Giant is always clean. This breed can feature a variety of colors that include light gray, steel gray, fawn, sandy, black, and white. A Continental Giant\u2019s fur will be glossy, dense, and thick. Because of its large size, the Continental Giant will do best in a house that has plenty of space. You can give your pet a large dog crate so that he will have a hideaway to relax in and retreat to, but this should only be a temporary solution. While having a lot of space to hop about freely and explore is a must for a big rabbit such as the Conti, they still need a home of their own.  For this purpose, you can choose a spacious rabbit cage, made from natural, rabbit-safe materials or coated aluminum wires. The bottom of the cage shouldn\u2019t be made from wire, though, as this could seriously hurt your rabbit\u2019s feet and cause issues such as sore hocks. Instead, opt for solid flooring, lined with bunny-safe bedding. The best bedding for Continental Giant is the one used for most other rabbit breeds and that\u2019s straw or hay. Alternatively, wood and paper pellets or shredded cardboard could do the trick. The bedding should be frequently replaced to ensure good hygiene and eliminate unpleasant odors in the cage. If you decide to give your bunny free reign of your home, keep in mind that these rabbits will chew on household items, so it is best to rabbit-proof your home so that your pet will not end up destroying everything from papers and shoes to wires and furnishings. Also, potty training your bunny is a fantastic idea- and with a bit of patience, the Continental Giant will learn where to do his business. This will make cleaning up after your pet so much easier! Providing your indoor rabbit with some time to play in your safe and secure outdoor garden is also a good idea. Just make sure to supervise them during the playtime, as they are vulnerable to many predators.  In case you are planning on giving your Continental Giant the chance to live in the great outdoors, make sure that his hutch is large enough to accommodate your pet\u2019s size. You can even provide your rabbit with a garden shed that is ventilated, has natural light, and is secure. In terms of nutrition, you should give your Continental Rabbit a diet that has variety. Include high quality rabbit pellets and hays, along with fibrous vegetables, for a well-balanced nutrition. Hay will make up the most of your pet\u2019s diet, but nutritious pellets and leafy greens are an equally important part of a Continental Giant\u2019s meal plan. In addition, you should make sure that your pet always has access to fresh, clean water. In general, the Continental Rabbit is a healthy breed, but there are certain issues that affect them and that are common for bunnies of their size. For instance, while sore hocks are a risk for any rabbit housed in a cage with inadequate flooring, the heavy Conti will develop this condition much more easily than a smaller bunny. Additionally, these large bunnies need a lot of space to stay healthy and content- housing them in a cramped cage will bring about a host of health issues; both mental and physical.  Then, there\u2019s the issue of overgrown teeth. Just like other rabbit breed, the Continental Rabbit could develop dental problems because the teeth continually grow. When they live as pets, they need our assistance to be able to grind them down to an acceptable level. Providing your pet with roughage and chew toys will help keep the teeth worn down. Hay should be the main part of your pet\u2019s diet both for its nutritional qualities and the fact that keeps plenty of issues at bay. In addition to assisting with teeth filing, hay will help with the passing of hairballs and work to prevent intestinal blockage. GI Stasis is a deadly issue that affects all rabbits which is why prevention and monitoring are very important. Proper grooming, a diet based on hay and inspection of your pet\u2019s feces for \u201cpearl string poop\u201d are the best course of action. When speaking of diet, you should also make sure to keep servings within the recommended size. You don\u2019t want your pet to become obese, as Continental Giants are at risk for serious health issues when they are overweight. Excess weight will make grooming even more difficult for your large rabbit, and being overweight will also make him more susceptible to flystrike. The Continental Giant is intelligent, friendly, and easy to train. Known as gentle giants, Continental Giant Rabbits are intelligent, friendly, and easy to train. They will play games, can be trained to use a litter tray, and will even respond when their name is called. A lot of people who keep these rabbits as pets will describe them as acting much like dogs, but in order for these animals to feel relaxed around people, they need to be handled frequently while they are young, and they need to be handled gently. Because they are so large, Continental Giants might not be the right choice for inexperienced owners and kids. They need to be handled carefully in order to prevent injuries, and you also need to know how to pick up and hold a large rabbit without frightening him. This will also make grooming and flystrike inspection an easy, pleasant task instead of the ordeal it can become when a large rabbit isn\u2019t accustomed to handling.

The Creme d\u2019Argent Rabbit was imported to the United States in the 1920s by several different breeders, particularly around the New York state area. The imported rabbit was much smaller and longer than the Creme d\u2019Argent rabbit we know today. One particular breeder by the name of Mr. Harry Clauss of Canadiagua, New York, took a special interest in the rabbit, wanting to develop it for both meat and show.  He developed the breed to give it a commercial body shape and also weeded out common faults such as dark ear lacing. This \u201cAmericanized\u201d version of the Creme d\u2019Argent Rabbit was recognized by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) around 1940. Once considered a rare breed, the Creme d\u2019Argent Rabbit is no longer in the \u201cwatch\u201d category according to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy; however it is still in the \u201crecovering\u201d category due to its slowly increasing population. The Creme d\u2019Argent rabbit has a unique orange-silver fur that shimmers. The Creme d\u2019Argent has a commercial-sized body shape and usually weighs anywhere from 8.5-11 lbs, with does usually weighing slightly more than bucks. They have full shoulders, medium-sized ears and deep hindquarters. Like most  Argente rabbits, the Creme d\u2019Argent Rabbit has short, rollback fur. They don\u2019t need regular grooming (as rabbits tend to groom themselves), but if your rabbit is shedding more than usual, an occasional grooming with a slicker brush should eliminate most of the stray hairs. Under no circumstances should you give your rabbit a bath, as baths make rabbits anxious and can cause cardiac problems. To clean off dirt, spot-clean your rabbit\u2019s coat with a damp cloth or towel. The Creme d\u2019Argent rabbit as an orange-silver or orange-fawn color. Its silver gene gives the rabbit its beautiful shade, as white guard hairs increase in number with age.  This is the only color combination currently accepted by the ARBA. The Creme d\u2019Argent rabbit is docile and easy to handle. Like any other breed of rabbit, Creme D\u2019Argent rabbits require a diet consisting of at least 70 percent hay. The rest of its diet is made up a healthy balance of pellets, leafy greens, fruits, and vegetables. Be aware of what kind of leafy greens you feed your rabbit, as some of them (such as iceberg lettuce) contain little vitamins or nutrients. Also be careful of what kind of vegetables you feed your rabbit, as some of them are simply harmful (such as beans, cabbage, potatoes, etc.) and other fruits contain too much sugar. This rabbit breed does well in indoors or outdoor enclosures as long as they are not exposed to extreme heat or cold. Outdoor enclosures should be lifted from the ground to protect them from potential predators and have a ramp to a fenced bottom so they can hop about on the grass below. Indoors rabbit cages (not unlike outdoor ones) need to be large enough so the rabbit can easily stretch out and play with toys. Enclosures should be made of wire and a have plastic/metal bottom to hold bedding, which need to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. The Creme d\u2019Argent Rabbit is not susceptible to any particular disease and is, overall, a healthy rabbit. The inside of their ears should be regularly checked for ermines or excess buildup of wax, and must be cleaned periodically. Like most other rabbits, they should also have their mouthes checked for overgrown teeth, as they do not stop growing when they get older. Rabbits that have a correct balance of hay, fruits and vegetables, should have no problem with overgrown teeth. A pea-sized amount of de-worming paste twice a year is also recommended to keep them healthy and protected all-year round.

Because this rabbit breed has been developed mostly for meat and show purposes, they are docile and easy to handle. Their large size makes them good pets for singles, seniors or couples who are looking for a medium-sized animal and don\u2019t want the maintenance of a dog or cat. While they can be good pets for families with children as well, their large size may be hard for younger children to handle. Older children who are careful with a larger sized rabbit will happily find that this breed is a sweet, loving pet who will enjoy being petted on its head, ears and back. Pet rabbits who are out of their enclosures generally need some toys to keep them occupied. This can be as simple as a few rolls of empty toilet papers rolls they can chew up and destroy, to as elaborate as a mentally stimulating toy from your local pet store. As with any pet, be sure you rabbit-proof your room. Rabbits are not impossible to litter train, but they are significantly more challenging than training other pets such as a cat or dog. They have the tendency to \u201cgo\u201d anywhere they please. Litter training requires plenty of patience and lots of litter boxes. Place a few litter boxes around your home where you find your rabbit tends to do the deed and with lots of hard work (and rewards!), you should be well on your way to litter-training your rabbit.", "facts": " Commercial Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors, Apartment Rabbits, House Rabbits, Families with older children, First-time owners, Indoor/Outdoor Rabbits Docile, friendly, well-mannered", "tags": "argente rabbit, creme d'argent, friendly rabbit breeds, rabbits for seniors, "}, "deilenaar rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/deilenaar-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/deilenaar-rabbit-668x446.jpg", "name": "Deilenaar Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Deilenaar Rabbit was first developed in a Dutch town called Deli in the 1930s. The breeder, Mr. Ridderhof, never revealed which rabbits he used to create this new and unique breed, but experts believe that the breeds involved were probably the New Zealand Red Rabbit, the Belgian Hare, and the Chinchilla Rabbit. They also believe that the Belgian Hare is the breed responsible for giving the Deilenaar Rabbit its lovely color. Other experts believe that the Tan Rabbit and the Flemish Giant Rabbit were also involved in the creation of the Deilanaar Rabbit. In 1940, the Deilanaar Rabbit was accepted by Dutch standards in the Netherlands. The breed slowly made its way throughout Europe because of the war, so it took until the latter part of the 1980s for the breed to be recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRC). Today, the breed is not yet recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBC), and it is rare outside of Europe. The Deilenaar Rabbit is rare outside of Europe. The Deilenaar Rabbit is medium in size and has a good posture. It is described as robust and thickset. Its body is also muscular, meaty, and compact. The head will be carried low, and the neck will be barely visible but it will be more developed in males than in females. The ears will be held erect and will be strong, and the ideal length for the ears will be around 11 cm. When observing this rabbit breed, you will also note the powerful and broad hindquarters and front legs. The breed standard states that the body should be muscular and hard, without any areas that are loose or flabby. The nails should be neat and short too. The medium-length coat on a Deilenaar Rabbit will be silky and dense, but it will be shorter on the head, ears, and legs. Also, the coat should not have any matting, and it should be lustrous and clean. One of the most unique features of the Deilenaar Rabbit is its coloring, which is a red agouti hue that features black ticking and mackereling. Its intermediate color would be a rusty brown, but the base color would be a slate blue that is evenly divided. The color of the fur will be rich and deep, and it will extend over the entire body except the underside of the rabbit and the inside of the back legs. The chest will feature an even warmer red-brown color, and the belly will be a creamy color that features red streaks in the groin area. The insides of the ears, along with the muzzle and jawline, will be a tan color, but the ears will be edged with a black color. The forelegs will feature the red agouti and ticking, but they will not have the mackereling because the fur will be much shorter there. This rabbit\u2019s nails should be dark, the whiskers should be colored, and the eyes should be bright and dark as well. The Deilenaar can be trained to use a litter tray.  You can house your Deilenaar Rabbit indoors or outside. If you are going to allow your pet to live outside, you need to provide him with a waterproof and weatherproof hutch that is out of direct sun and direct wind. Your rabbit should be protected from elements and predators both, which is best achieved if their hutch is in a spacious shed. On the other hand, it\u2019s not recommended keeping a bunny outside if you want them to be family pets, as they won\u2019t be as socialized.  When keeping your rabbit indoors, you can set up an indoor rabbit cage or dog crate in a quiet and secure area of your house. This will ensure your pet has a place to retreat to and rest comfortably in. For a rabbit of Deilenaar\u2019s size, the cage should have a minimum of 3 square feet of floor space.  Your bunny should be able to comfortably stretch out, hop and sit inside the cage without being cramped. While the cage itself should be made from sturdy, rabbit-safe wire, the bottom should be solid. Wire bottom cages lead to sore hocks and can lower the quality of your pet\u2019s life. As for the diet, Deilenaar Rabbit is no different than most other breeds. They need a lot of hay (roughly 70 percent of their diet should be timothy or other grass hays), high-quality pellets for rabbits and fresh veggies. From time to time, you can treat your bunny to a juicy fruit, but it shouldn\u2019t be too often- obesity is bad for your rabbit\u2019s health. You should also provide your pet with fresh, clean water at all times. Overall, the Deilenaar Rabbit is a healthy and strong breed, especially since it is a hybrid breed. Nevertheless, there are some common issues that affect all rabbits, despite how hardy they naturally are. For instance, unlike most mammals, rabbit\u2019s teeth continue to grow throughout his life. As a result, their teeth can become overgrown which is not only very painful for the bunny but can lead to a serious infection, too. Symptoms of overgrown teeth are drooling, matted fur on the face or chest, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Luckily, it\u2019s easy to prevent this. Regularly inspect their teeth and make sure their diet is designed to promote good oral and overall health. Your rabbit\u2019s diet should be largely based on roughage (hay) which helps them grind their teeth down in addition to providing essential nutrients. To boot, you should offer bunny-safe chew toys such as willow and grass balls, willow branches, or woven grass mats- to name a few.  In addition to overgrown teeth, the two most common problems that affect rabbits are snuffles and hairballs (GI stasis). The first, as the name suggests, is a bacterial infection of the respiratory system that manifests as sneezing, sniffling, and discharge from eyes. The culprit is the Pasteurella multocida bacterium and if the issue is caught on time, it can be treated with antibiotics. The production of hairballs is somewhat similar to that in cats, but with one main difference- rabbits can\u2019t vomit. In their case, all the hair they swallow while grooming themselves can form into a hairball that lodges in the intestines, leading to a potentially fatal condition called GI stasis.  Unless your rabbit is going to breed throughout his or her life, it\u2019s best for their health that you get them fixed on time. Sterilization prevents behavioral issues (e.g. urine marking), makes rabbits friendlier, and most importantly- minimizes the risk of uterine cancer for does. Veterinarians recommend that spaying is done at approximately 6 months of age when the doe becomes sexually mature, and neutering should be done at 8 to 12 weeks or as soon as the buck\u2019s testicles drop.  One of the most unique features of the Deilenaar is its red agouti color. Deilenaar Rabbits have an even temperament, making them wonderful pets. You will notice aspects of this rabbit\u2019s foundation breeds in its personality, so these animals will be affectionate, lively, and friendly. Considered reasonably intelligent, the Deilenaar can be trained to use a litter tray. You can also provide your pet with some cat toys, including those with bells and rattles, to keep him occupied. Be aware that, because these rabbits are lively, you need to give them room to roam freely, but you should rabbit-proof your house in order to ensure their safety. Also, because they are lively, they could be skittish, so handle your rabbit with care. In fact, this breed might not be the best choice for those who are inexperienced in keeping and handling rabbits.", "facts": " Compact Pet owners with experience in handling rabbits Affectionate, lively, friendly", "tags": "belgian hare, chinchilla rabbit, Deilenaar Rabbit, Flemish Giant Rabbit, New Zealand Red Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit breed, Tan Rabbit, "}, "dutch rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/dutch-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dutch-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Dutch Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Dutch rabbit is one of the oldest domestic rabbit breeds. It is a descendant of the Petite Braban\u00e7on from the Brabant region in Flanders which was bred in large numbers for the meat industry in the late 19th century. The Dutch rabbit is said to have originated sometime around 1850 in Holland, where it is called the Hollander Rabbit. In 1864, it found its way to England where it grew in popularity and has since then been exported to many places around the world. A show-worthy Dutch rabbit should have a very rounded body throughout. A show-worthy Dutch rabbit should have a very rounded body throughout.  They have a small, compact body with a rounded head, short, broad ears (especially near the base), and back legs that are longer than the front legs. A Dutch rabbit\u2019s flyback fur is short, glossy and easy to maintain. Like most rabbit breeds, the Dutch rabbit will also go through a seasonal molt (much like a dog when it sheds in the spring). During that time, you will have to groom them a little more often than usual. When they go through molts, you can expect to have your clothes full of their fur when you pick them up and give them some loving, which is why daily brushing during molts is a must. Otherwise, one brushing a week should be sufficient. There are several types of Dutch rabbits, all identified by their coats. Despite having so many types, however, their markings are almost all the same. They all have dark colored ears and rumps, a band of white from the top of their shoulders to their belly, white legs and a wedge of white fur running up the front of the face which is called the \u2018Blaze\u2019. There is the Black Dutch rabbit, which has pure white and slate black fur with dark brown eyes; the Blue Dutch whose eyes are a blue-grey and fur color is a medium-dark blue and glossy; and the Chinchilla Dutch who has either dark brown or blue-grey and their fur is a speckled grey mixed with white. There are four more Dutch rabbits that are also recognized in shows including the Chocolate Dutch (either dark-brown or ruby eyes and chocolate brown fur); the Gray Dutch that has mixed-colored fur (slate blue, medium tan, then charcoal brown and chocolate) and dark brown eyes; the Steel Dutch rabbit (dark brown eyes and a mostly black body with off-white or cream coloration on some of the hair tips); and finally, the Tortoise Dutch rabbit (bright orange/cream colored coat and dark brown eyes). A Dutch rabbit\u2019s flyback fur is short, glossy and easy to maintain. Dutch rabbits are one of the oldest domestic breeds around, so you can be sure that they love to be outside their enclosure whenever possible. They will happily run and jump high into the air when they are out of their hut, especially if they are outside with some soft grass beneath their fuzzy little feet. Like most rabbits, they will live a long, healthy life so long as they are given plenty of outdoor time and fed a diet of 70 percent hay and the rest being a mix of pellets, fruits and vegetables. However, some fruits and vegetables can pose a danger to their health. Unless you\u2019ve researched the fruit/vegetable and are sure it is safe to feed it to them, the rule of thumb is simply not to feed them if you are unsure. Some food that can be dangerous to your rabbit include seeds from fruits such as apples and pears \u2013 they contain tiny particles of cyanide and despite being harmless to humans, they can hurt your rabbit. Bark and cherry tree twigs should be avoided, as well rhubarb (it contains oxalates which prevents absorption of calcium) and mushrooms (this hurts them in the long run, as it has been shown to cause cancer in mice). Their enclosure could be indoors or out, weather and temperature-permitting. Rabbits do not do well in extreme heat and most do not do well in the cold (including the Dutch rabbit), so always be aware of outdoor conditions before letting your rabbit spend time outside. Their enclosure needs to be clean and dung-free. If there is hay bedding, always be sure to clean it at least once every other day. There is an age-old question when it comes to the domesticated rabbited: wire enclosure vs. bedding. Rabbits prefer bedding because it is easier on their feet and more comfortable while humans prefer to have wire-bottomed enclosures because it is easier to clean, however it is harder on the rabbit\u2019s feet. With a wire-bottomed enclosure, their excrement simply falls through the wire and onto a removable bottom that owners can easily change while with bedding, you\u2019ll have to go into the enclosure and clean it out, which is more time-consuming. In the end, the decision is that of the owner\u2019s but if you want a happier rabbit, make or purchase an enclosure that has a hay bottom. It may be slightly more time-consuming to clean out their waste, but the result will be a rabbit that is comfortable with their enclosure and is less strenuous on their poor legs. These should be cleaned out thoroughly once a week, while droppings should be removed daily. Unlike most animals, rabbit teeth never stop growing. Thankfully, they are also constantly being worn down by everyday activities such as chewing their food and grinding their own teeth. If for some reason your rabbit\u2019s teeth are not being worn down, their overgrown teeth may start growing into their jaw and face, causing severe pain and discomfort. Signs of overgrown teeth or an infection due to overgrown teeth include loss of appetite slugging activity or drooling around the mouth. Be sure to check your rabbit\u2019s mouth often for signs of overgrown teeth and bring them to the vet if you suspect they have an infection, as it can be treated with antibiotics and veterinarians can also fix their overgrown teeth problem. Female rabbits (called does) can be spayed when they are as young as four months old, however vets tend to wait until they are six months old. Male rabbits (called bucks) are eligible to be neutered as young as three and a half months old. All rabbits should also be given worm prevention treatment and checked for ticks and fleas regularly. These rabbits absolutely love to be out of their enclosure and into the world. These little guys absolutely love to be out of their enclosure and into the world. Due to their gentle nature, they do well with children so long as they are handled carefully and have enough time out of their enclosure to become social animals. Should they spend too much time in their enclosure, they will become depressed and/or bored, especially if they have no companion rabbit with them. They are wonderful first-time pets, as they are relatively low maintenance so long as you provide them with essential items to keep them safe, healthy and happy. Because they are such sociable animals, they are also good pets for couples and seniors, so long as retirees are able to physically to tend to the rabbit\u2019s needs which includes feeding them, cleaning their enclosure and etc. Rabbits take on a completely different approach when it comes to training. Activities that humans would deem unacceptable such as urinating in the corner or scratching up your carpet are completely natural to them and you must understand this before trying to train any kind of rabbit. They are also not children in that you should not punish them if they do something unpleasant, as this will get you nowhere with training. Instead, you should only reward them with a treat when they complete something successfully (such as urinating in the proper area). Never yell or shout at your rabbit when you become frustrated that are not as obedient as you would like them to be, as rabbits will consider you the enemy and may become aggressive or dislike you and absolutely refuse to participate in any further training. Owners much approach rabbits with an extremely patient mindset in order to train the rabbit to do anything from potty training to tricks.", "facts": " Compact Indoor rabbit, Families with young children, First-time rabbit owners, Couples, Seniors Calm, easygoing, energetic, friendly", "tags": "Blaze, domestic rabbit, Dutch Rabbit, first-time owners, flyback fur, Petite Braban\u00e7on, "}, "dwarf hotot": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/dwarf-hotot/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dwarf-hotot.jpg", "name": "Dwarf Hotot", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Contrary to popular belief, the Dwarf Hotot is not a miniature version of the larger Hotot, but was developed by crossing several breeds with the normal-sized Hotot. The original Hotot was developed in France at the beginning of the 20th century by Baroness Bernard. The Dwarf variety was the result of breeding efforts in both East and West Germany in the 1970s. Two breeders independently bred the same rabbit, but came together to cross them. They used both the White Hotot and the Netherland Dwarf to create the Dwarf Hotot. In 1970, Elizabeth Forstinger of California brought seven Dwarf Hotots from West Germany to the United States and began showing them in 1980. Two years later, the American Dwarf Hotot Rabbit Club was created, and the breed was recognized by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) in 1983. The Dwarf Hotot is also known as the \u2018eyes of the fancy\u2019, a name whose origin is made apparent as soon as you first see these striking bunnies.  Show-worthy Dwarf Hotots are all white with a ring of black around their eyes that looks like eyeliner. As their name suggests, the Dwarf Hotot is a small rabbit that weighs between 2.5 to 3.5 lbs once fully grown. These unique-looking rabbits are best known for their white coats contrasted by the black eye markings. Dwarf Hotot has a compact body type, with a round, well-filled head and short neck.  Their hindquarters should be rounded and in line with the wide shoulders. The ears are short and thick. In addition to their adorable looks, these rabbits also have a friendly personality that makes them a good choice for a pet.  This rabbit breed\u2019s coat is short, dense and shiny. The Dwarf Hotot has so-called rollback fur, which means that their hair stays upright when stroked. These coats do not require much attention, and due to the Dwarf Hotot\u2019s size, you may not even notice when they begin to molt. However, like all rabbits, this breed will also have seasonal molting, usually in the spring.  When this occurs, it\u2019s important to increase the frequency of the brushing- both to prevent loose hair flying around your home and to minimize the amount of it you bunny ingests when self-grooming. Rabbits cannot vomit, so ingesting too much of their own hair can become a serious issue, leading to complications such as intestinal blockage. As a rule of thumb, during the molting season, a good daily brush with a slicker comb will keep everything under control.  The ARBA accepts one Dwarf Hotot color combination. Show-worthy rabbits are all white with a ring of black around their eyes which almost looks like eyeliner. The black band that circles their eyes shouldn\u2019t be too thin or too thick with a feathered appearance- ideally, it would be a \u215b of an inch thick.  Naturally, these are requirements for a show quality rabbit and your own pet Dwarf Hotot might not fulfill every requirement. In fact, some Dwarf Hotot don\u2019t even have the pure white coat- Dutch marked or English Spotted kits are not unusual. The only \u2018catch\u2019 is that such rabbits cannot be shown for competitions, but otherwise they make lovely pets, same as their show-quality cousins. The Dwarf Hotot  is friendly and suited for life as a pet. Due to this rabbit\u2019s small size, it does not require a large cage \u2013 a 24 x 24 or 18 x 24 inch cage is sufficient. Usually, these enclosures are made from steel wire, often coated with powder. However, the cage should not have a wire bottom, as stepping on the wire can lead to a painful condition known as sore hocks. Instead, opt for the solid bottom or place a thick layer of rabbit-safe bedding on the bottom to make it soft and comfortable enough for your pet. Bedding needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. It is not recommended that this breed be kept as an outdoor rabbit due to its small size. Naturally, the enclosure you get for your pet shouldn\u2019t be their only habitat. In fact, keeping them in a cage all the time would be cruel. Think of your pet\u2019s enclosure like their own little room where they can sleep and eat (and go potty), but your home should be where they get to spend most of their time. Before you let your Dwarf Hotot out of the cage, though, make sure to bunny-proof the room. Hide all cables, protect furniture and remove potentially toxic plants and foods that could poison your pet. The Dwarf Hotot will eat as much as much food as you give it, and although hay should be given in unlimited quantities, rabbits of this size only require a quarter cup of rabbit pellets per day. Their diet should consist of 70 percent hay, a quarter cup of pellets per day, and the rest should be a balance of rabbit-safe leafy greens, fruits and vegetables. Like most dwarf breeds, the Dwarf Hotot is susceptible to malocclusion, a condition where the front teeth are directly above the lower teeth rather than in front of them. When rabbits have this condition, they may accidentally pull a tooth on its cage or have difficulties eating. This can be every 6-8 weeks so they can shorten their teeth. In addition, you should have your vet regularly deworm your rabbit and make sure they have rabbit-safe flea prevention treatment.  With all bunnies, but especially those of this size, vigilance is what makes sure they get to live long and healthy lives. While there are not generally many diseases that target indoor-only, pet bunnies, there are many conditions that could lead to serious problems if not noticed on time. One those is snuffles, an upper respiratory tract infection that commonly affects all rabbit breeds. Runny eyes and nose, head tilting are just some of the symptoms- if you catch them on time, antibiotics treatment could save your bunny.  Dwarf Hotot bucks can be neutered as young as three and a half months old, while does can be spayed once they are four months old. Some veterinarians tend to wait until the doe is older, as it poses less of a risk when they are on the operating table. Dwarf Hotots aren\u2019t as active as other rabbit breeds, and will be content sitting in your lap for a cuddle. As a rule, this rabbit breed is generally friendly and suited for life as a pet, so long as it gets as much human interaction as possible. This means taking your rabbit out of their enclosure on a daily basis and starting the routine when they are kits. That way, they will be accustomed to being handled by adults, as well as older children who understand how to handle fragile pets. Dwarf Hotots become quickly attached to their human companions. In fact, owners should take care when opening their cages after leaving them alone for a few hours, as the Dwarf Hotot is known to jump out of its cage in excitement! This rabbit isn\u2019t as active as other breeds, however they can run a few laps around your bunny-safe room before they tire out on your lap. Like most rabbits, they do benefit from having a few bunny-safe toys so they can have some fun while out of their enclosures. These toys can be as simple as a small ball they can roll around to a mentally stimulating rabbit-safe toy from your local pet store. Rabbits are a little harder to litter train than cats and dogs, but it is possible. They tend to \u201cgo\u201d in one particular corner of their enclosure, so they associate whatever material is used in that corner as the ideal place to do the deed. Consequently, should you place a few of these litter boxes with the same material in different corners of your home. When they successfully do their business in the correct place, make sure to reward them with a small piece of fruit or rabbit-safe vegetable.", "facts": " Compact Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors, Apartment Rabbits, House Rabbits, Families with older children, First-time owners, Indoor Rabbits Playful, sweet, affectionate, energetic", "tags": "cute rabbits, dwarf hotot, dwarf rabbit breeds, eyeliner rabbit, family-friendly rabbits, hotot rabbit, malocclusion, small rabbits for kids, "}, "enderby island rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/enderby-island-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/enderby-island-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Enderby Island Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Enderby Island Rabbit, which is also referred to as the Enderby Rabbit, is a breed that descended from the rabbits that were taken from Australia to be released on Enderby Island in October of 1865. The animals survived in isolation on the island for almost 130 years, during which they became a distinct breed. This is a rare and endangered breed that is believed to be a descendant of the English Silver Grey Rabbit. When the rabbits were put on Enderby Island, it was an uninhabited subantarctic island of the Auckland Islands, and they were to serve as food for castaways. Although the rabbits were exterminated for purposes of wildlife management in the early \u201890s, the Rare Breeds Conservation Society of New Zealand managed to save a breeding group of 49 Enderby Island Rabbits in 1992. Enderby Rabbits are prone to being skittish, but can be socialized. The Enderby Island Rabbit has a medium length body that features a slight taper from the front to the hindquarters, and the back will also be slightly arched. The head, which is well set upon the shoulders, should be medium in size and it should be in proportion with the rest of the body. There is not a visible neck, and the ears are carried in the shape of a \u201cV\u201d. The eyes are bold. The legs and the feet are fine to medium boned, and the nails will match the body color. In general, when looking at an Enderby Island Rabbit, you will notice that the body is fine-boned and slim. The head will be small, and the ears will be delicate and upright. The coat of the Enderby Island Rabbit is soft and short. Enderby Rabbits can come in a few different colors, but the majority of them will be a distinct silver-grey with a dark slate blue undercoat. The ears, tail, and head will be darker and are often black. Acceptable colors for this rabbit breed include slate, champagne, and cr\u00e8me. Champagne and slate rabbits are actually born black, and cr\u00e8me rabbits are born featuring a fawn color. The body will become heavily silvered (roughly 80% silvering) in most Enderby Rabbits, but the feet, tail, ears, and head will be lightly silvered. You will notice the Enderby Island Rabbit\u2019s distinct silvering begin to appear on the coat at around 6 to 8 weeks. It could take up to 6 months or more for it to come into the full coat. Also, the juvenile coat of the Enderby Rabbit will feature solid patches in the base color. And as the rabbits age, they will become even more silvered. The Enderby Island Rabbit is a rare and endangered breed. If you are planning on bringing an Enderby Island Rabbit into your family, you should have enough room for a large enclosure that will keep your pet safe and comfortable. Your rabbit should be able to stand up, turn around, and stretch while in his cage, and he should be able to come out of the cage regularly in order to play and interact with you. You can keep your Enderby Island Rabbit indoors or outside, as this breed is hardy and accustomed to cold weather, but be sure to protect him from predators. Indoors, make room for your pet to run around and exercise outside of the cage, and give him an area where he can get access to fresh air and sunshine. If you want to let your rabbit spend some time outside, you can place your rabbit in an exercise pen, lawn enclosure, or extension hut for safety. Feed your Enderby Rabbit a diet that consists of pellets, hay, and vegetables. You can include grass hays like orchard, oat, and timothy hays, and you can purchase pellets designed for rabbits. Fresh foods, such as dark, leafy greens, should also be provided. Limit the amount of starchy veggies and fruits that your rabbit eats, and always provide fresh, clean water. Keep your pet\u2019s environment as stress-free as possible because stress alone could lower your rabbit\u2019s ability to resist disease. Like other rabbits, the Enderby Island Rabbit might be susceptible to ear mites, conjunctivitis, bloat, hairball obstructions, and intestinal problems, such as coccidiosis. The coat of an Enderby Island Rabbit will become heavily silvered. Enderby Rabbits are prone to being skittish, but you can reduce the amount of nervousness that your pet feels by simply providing him with plenty of attention and gentle handling. When an Enderby Island Rabbit is properly socialized, he will be affectionate towards the people that he has grown to trust. Bond with your pet by grooming him and giving him treats. Eventually, your rabbit might show you how much he loves you by licking and kissing you. Also keep in mind that, like all rabbits, the Enderby Rabbit is a social creature that is happiest when it is with other rabbits, so if you have the space for two or three rabbits, or you don\u2019t have the time to dedicate to interacting with your rabbit, consider getting more than one.", "facts": " Commercial Experienced rabbit owners who are willing to work with a naturally nervous breed Skittish, affectionate, neat, social", "tags": "Australian rabbit breed, Enderby Island, Enderby Island Rabbit, Enderby Rabbit, English Silver Grey Rabbit, rabbit breed, Silver Grey Rabbit, Silver Rabbit, "}, "english angora rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/english-angora-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/english-angora.jpg", "name": "English Angora Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Angora rabbit is one of the oldest domestic breed of rabbits, originating from Ankara, Turkey (historically known as Angora). They eventually made their way to America where, prior to 1939, there was merely one type of woolly rabbits, which was called the \u201cAngora Wooler.\u201d In 1939, the Angora Wooler was re-classified into two type of rabbits \u2013 the French and English type. In 1944, the ARBA (American Rabbit Breeders Association) officially separated these into two breeds, which are now known as the French Angora and English Angora Rabbit. The English Angora Rabbit is docile and sociable. These small, compact rabbits have a broad, flat head and short ears with plenty of woolly fur on them. They also have fur on their faces (unlike any other Angora), as well as woolly feet. The English Angora rabbit is the only Angora that has facial furnishings. This means they have dense bands and even side trimmings so their entire body (including their feet) are covered in fur. They are often called \u201cround balls of fluff\u201d when their coat is in perfect condition. The English Angora\u2019s coat is thick, woolly and silky in texture. Regular grooming, even during off-shedding periods, are necessary, or else their fur become tangled, matted and otherwise unpleasant. Whether you are raising your English Angora rabbit to be a show rabbit, wool production rabbit or pet rabbit, it is important to keep their coat tangle-free. In order to do this, use a pet grooming brush with wire bristles (similar to those used with dogs or cats) once to twice a week. If you\u2019re English Angora is a pet, be sure to take it to a groomer or use shears to keep their coat short, as it will constantly grow. Those using the English Angoras for their wool report shearing their coat about four times per year \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of wool! Should any matting appear, you may also use shears to remove them. If you decide to keep an English Angora rabbit as a pet, giving them what is known as a \u201cpuppy cut\u201d will make grooming them easier. This kind of \u201chaircut\u201d involves shearing most of their bodies and faces to keep their coat short, but leaving their feet and ear coat relatively long. The result is a rabbit that resembles somewhat of a tiny poodle. Make sure your rabbit\u2019s diet is high in fiber and groom your rabbit regularly. English Angoras can come in a rainbow of different colors. The Agouti group of English Angoras is classified as Lynx, Chestnut and Chocolate. The Self group comes in Black, Blue, Chocolate or Lilac, the Shaded Group English Angoras are Black Tort, Blue Tort, Chocolate Tort or Lilac Tort and the Show Class is classified as having ruby eyes and a white coat. Finally, the Pointed Group English Angoras have either white wool with either black spots on their nose and legs (these are called the Black Pointed White), white wool with brown spots on their nose and legs (Chocolate Pointed White) or white wool with light grey spots on their nose and legs (Blue Pointed White). First and foremost, English Angoras require a lot of attention in the coat department because their coat is so woolly and thick. They need regular brushings (1-2 times a week) with a wire-bristled comb and shearing approximately four times a year to keep their coat mat-free. Unless you are willing to dedicate this much time into keeping your rabbit happy and healthy, we do not recommend this breed for first-time owners. Like most rabbits, English Angora rabbits require a diet consisting 70 percent of hay. The remaining 30 percent should be equal amounts of fresh fruits, vegetables and high-quality pellets to ensure they are getting the recommended vitamins, nutrients and proteins needed to grow.  Baby rabbits, or \u201ckits,\u201d require a different diet. Any kit younger than 3 weeks old should strictly be drinking their mother\u2019s milk. Kits that are 3-4 weeks old can be given nibbles of alfalfa as well as pellets and once they are 4-7 weeks, you should given them access to plenty pellets as well as alfalfa. When kits are 7 weeks to 7 months old, you should switch to unlimited pellets and hay and finally, when they are 12 weeks old, slowly introduce them to vegetables to find out which ones they prefer. English Angoras make great pets and their enclosure can either be indoors or outdoors, depending on your housing situation. Indoor bunny enclosures should be large enough to allow your rabbit to move around freely and should have bedding to keep your Angora happy. To ensure a clean coat, make sure to spot-clean your rabbit\u2019s enclosure everyday and change their bedding once or twice a week. If the enclosure it outside, make sure it has enough protection from dangers such as inclement weather and other wildlife, but access to wind and sun. These creatures are docile and sociable, so be sure to take them out of their enclosure to have plenty indoor or outdoor playtime. Should you live in an apartment or home with no fenced backyard, letting your rabbit roam free around the house will give them plenty of exercise, however they would also love to go outside and catch some rays and feel the grass beneath their feet. The most worrisome health issue the English Angora rabbit faces is the potential for woodblock. Rabbits are clean animals that groom themselves often and because the English Angora (not unlike the Satin Angora) has such thick, long wool, they can accidentally inject some fur whilst grooming.  Normally, this is passed through their droppings but it is possible that this fur is trapped inside the digestive system and creates a furball. Unlike cats, rabbits cannot regurgitate to eliminate this hairball and consequently, it gets larger and larger. The hairball grows so much that the rabbit either believes it is full and dies because it does not eat or it blocks the digestive track completely and it simply cannot eat. Either way, woodblock is a dangerous and real problem when it comes to rabbits who have long, thick fur. Symptoms of woodblock include a decrease in appetite (or not eating at all), decreased activity, and droppings are less frequent and/or are strung together by wool. If you see any or more than one of these symptoms, be sure to consult your veterinarian for the next step. Thankfully, there are ways of preventing wool block in your rabbit, diet being the most important. Make sure your rabbit\u2019s diet is high in fiber and groom your rabbit regularly. Many breeders also supplement with pineapple chunks or papaya tablets once a week to prevent wool block. Regular grooming even during off-shedding periods are necessary with the English Angora rabbit. English Angoras are even-tempered rabbits who love to spend quality time with their human handlers. Because they require so much grooming, they will no doubt bond with the person who grooms them the most often, especially if it is the same person who feeds, pets and plays with them. They do not have the tendency to be skittish or ill-mannered, so introducing them to children won\u2019t be difficult. While they don\u2019t crave constant attention, their personalities flourish when they are mostly out and about and interacting with humans, which is why this is a great breed for both singles and couples who would like a pet in their lives. When they are having their daily outdoor time out of their enclosures, make sure to have a couple of toys handy so they can chew. Aside from wool block, some rabbits also develop overgrown teeth due to poor diet. Should you be feeding your rabbit a balanced diet of hay, pellets and vegetables, overgrown teeth should not be a problem but giving them something to chew on (like a dog toy) won\u2019t hurt, plus it will keep them entertained. Some rabbits also like chewing on pieces of wood (some have been known to chew parts of their wooden enclosure), so giving them a piece of rabbit-safe wood to entertain them is also acceptable.", "facts": " Compact Experienced owners, Families with younger/older children, Singles, Couples Gentle, docile, curious, calm", "tags": "American Rabbit Breeders Association, Angora Wooler, ARBA, english angora, kits, woodblock, "}, "english lop": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/english-lop/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/english-lop.jpg", "name": "English Lop", "type": "rabbit", "text": "While some claim that the English Lop first originated in Africa, it is not entirely known where the breed started. However, a variety of them appeared by the mid 1800s in England and soon came over to American soil via trade ships. Back then, breeders resorted to cruel practices such as waxing and stretching the English Lop\u2019s ears to make them longer and more impressionable. Thankfully, this trend has ended and no modern breeder would ever think of harming this precious rabbit simply for looks. English Lops are popular for two main characteristics: their large, floppy ears and their wonderful personalities. The English Lop is best known for its long, over-sized ears that fall on either side of its face. The ears are round and should not point at the end. They have large heads with wide-set eyes with a mandolin-shaped body. Their feet should be straight with the front feet not bow-legged or bent and the tail should be straight (not screwed). An English Lop\u2019s ears should be soft to the touch and coated in soft fur. Their flyback coat is smooth, short and relatively easy to maintain. They don\u2019t need regular grooming (as rabbits tend to groom themselves), however should you find that your rabbit is shedding more than usual, the occasional grooming with a slicker brush should eliminate most of those pesky stray hairs. Under no circumstances should you give your rabbit a bath, as baths make rabbits very anxious and can cause cardiac problems. Should your rabbit be a little dirtier than usual, spot-clean their coat with a damp towel instead. The English Lop comes in a variety of both solid and broken colors. Their colors include black orange/fawn, agouti/opal, chinchilla (grey), red-eyed-white as well as blue and black torts. Make sure to take your rabbit out of their enclosure everyday so they can stretch out their muscular legs and hop around. The English Lop requires a little bit more maintenance in the ear department than most other breeds because they are so long. Their ears should be examined regularly and kept clean of wax buildup and their nails need to be regularly trimmed so in case they step on their own ears, their nails won\u2019t dig into them. However, they don\u2019t require any more care than usual when it comes to their diet or type of enclosure. Like most rabbits, they require a diet consisting of 70 percent timothy hay the rest being a balance of fruit, vegetables and pellets. Some suggested fruits include pears, kiwi, papaya, mango, pineapple (skin removed), stare fruits, currants and apricots. Some vegetables that most rabbits love to gnaw on every once in a while include broccolini, celery, broccoli (both the leaves and the stems), Brussels sprouts and bell peppers of any color. Your rabbit\u2019s diet should also be made up a healthy some of leafy greens such as Swiss chard, radish tops, spinach and sprouts. Whether your rabbit\u2019s enclosure is indoor or outdoors, it needs to be cleaned at least once a day to remove their daily droppings. Their bedding should be changed every week or twice a week, depending on how many rabbits you have in one hutch/enclosure.  There are many different kinds of bedding available on the market, some of them better in quality than others. Make sure to take the time to read labels and find out which one is best for your particular enclosure and rabbit situation. English Lops love to play! Make sure to take your rabbit out of their enclosure everyday (even if its just for a few hours) so they can stretch out their muscular legs and hop around. They also enjoy being petted on the head and back, much like a cat, and won\u2019t hesitate to hop over to their caregiver to receive the occasional head pat. Due to its large ears that drag on the ground, owners must pay particular attention to their ears and make sure they are not hurt, as it can lead to infection. This means clipping their toenails so they don\u2019t accidentally step on their ears and hurt them. Also, never leave a bowl of water outside for your rabbit when the temperature is hovering just over or is under the freezing mark. If the Lop\u2019s ears touch the water, there is a risk of the tips of the ears freezing and consequently tearing. Moreover, this breed of rabbit does better in the heat than in the cold because of their large ears, so always be aware of the weather conditions outside and bring your rabbit indoors should it be to cold for them to handle. The inside of their ears should also be regularly checked for excess buildup of wax and must be cleaned periodically. Like most other rabbits, they should also have their mouths checked for overgrown teeth, as they do not stop growing when they get older. Rabbits that have a correct balance of hay, fruits and vegetables, however, should have no problem with overgrown teeth. Due to its large ears that drag on the ground, pay particular attention to your English Lop\u2019s ears. English Lops are popular for two main characteristics: their large, floppy ears and their wonderful personalities. These rabbits are energetic and curious as small kits (short for \u2018kittens\u2019, which is what baby rabbits are called) and their playful nature continues long into their adult lives. They are calm, laid-back rabbits which is why they are so great for families. Whether parents have younger or older children, first-time rabbit parents or long-time pet parents, the English Lop will want nothing more than to spend some quality time with their favorite human family and have some fun while their at it. They are gentle creatures, which is also great news for first-time pet parents as well as seniors who don\u2019t have the energy to keep up with a bouncing puppy but would still like some companionship once their own children have flown the nest. They are willing to be picked up, petted and have no problem doing the same for strangers. English Lops do not require much toys, as they aren\u2019t the gnawing type, but they will benefit from having some entertainment from some rabbit-friendly trinkets. These rabbits do not require constant attention, but will enjoy the occasional back scratch and petting from their owners and kids. Most of all, they require plenty of space and time to roam freely either within the house or outside in a fenced yard. They are also known to be intelligent rabbits who will understand the concept of what a litter box is a little faster than most rabbits. This also means that they may be easier to train in terms of tricks and commands as well.", "facts": " Semi-Arch/Mandolin Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors, Apartment Rabbits, House Rabbits, First-time owners, Indoor rabbits, Families with children Curious, friendly, energetic, playful", "tags": "curious rabbits, english lop, flyback coat, friendly rabbits, over-sized rabbit ears, "}, "english spot rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/english-spot-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/english-spot-rabbit.jpg", "name": "English Spot Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The English Spot Rabbit is one of the oldest rabbit breeds, dating back to the mid-19th century. The main purpose for developing this particular breed of rabbit was for show purposes, which back in those days, was uncommon since rabbits were mainly used for meat purposes. It is suggested that they may have come from the Great Lorrainese (now known as the Giant Papillon), although it is also said that they may have descended from the English Butterfly and/or the Checkered Giant. In 1910, the English Spot Rabbit was imported to North America and 12 years later in 1924, the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) accepted it as a recognized breed, and subsequently, the American English Spot Rabbit Club was established. The English Spot Rabbit wonderful choice for singles, couples, families and seniors. The English Spot rabbit is medium-sized, weighing anywhere from 5-8 lbs. They have a full arch body shape, long slender legs and hind legs which are parallel to the body. They also have round hips and vertical ears. English Spot Rabbits have short, dense flyback fur. Throughout the year, they may shed, but because the coat fibers are so short, you won\u2019t notice it too much. Rather than forming clumps at the corner of your homes, it may get stuck in your clothing instead. In order to minimize the amount of fur in the home (especially during heavier shedding periods ), simply groom your rabbit with a slicker brush outdoors once every week or biweekly. There are a few different colors recognized by the ARBA when it comes to English Spots. Black, blue, chocolate, gold, gray, lilac, and tortoise are all recognized, and all show-worthy English Spots have markings. This includes a nose marking that looks like a butterfly, eye circles, cheek spots, coloured ears, a random chain of spots along each side of its body and a strip of color down their back called a \u201cherringbone\u201d. English Spots are gentle, affectionate and have just enough spunk to make them interesting companions. The English Spot Rabbit needs an adequate enclosure to  spend some of its time to eat, sleep and play. Outdoor enclosures should be raised and have enough space for the rabbit to stretch its legs out comfortably (which, considering this rabbit\u2019s size, would require it to be rather large). Indoor rabbit enclosures should be made of wire all around, have a plastic or metal bottom and be large enough for the English Spot to stretch out. The bottom of the cages should be covered in rabbit-safe bedding and it needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. English Spots have a long history of being used as show rabbit rather than for their pelt, meat or as a pet. Because they are such docile, easy-going animals, they can be easily be a lovely house pet that will give you many years of happiness and memories. Indoor rabbits should have at least 1-2 hours minimum outside of their enclosures to stretch their legs and use up energy, as they are energetic bunnies.  If you can keep them outside, be sure to let your rabbit roam in a fenced part of your yard. In terms of food, this rabbit\u2019s diet requires 70 percent hay. There are many different kinds of hay available for rabbits according to price point and nutritional value. The rest of their diet should be a balance of leafy greens, pellets, fruits and vegetables. Be wary of what kind of fruits or vegetables you have in your home, as some of them are not recommended to be given to rabbits. Some rabbit-safe vegetables include fennel, pumpkin, asparagus, cauliflower, cucumber, and watercress. Hay and fresh water should always be readily available for your rabbit. The English Spot Rabbit is not particularly susceptible to any hereditary diseases, however there are some things you need to watch for. Overgrown teeth is by far one of the most popular problems rabbits face and it can be prevented with a well-balanced diet consisting mostly of hay. If your rabbit doesn\u2019t seem to be eating, is less energetic and/or has less droppings than usual, their teeth may be growing into their face and/or jaw, causing a lot of pain. Should you suspect overgrown teeth, simply take them to your local veterinarian where they can correct the teeth and prescribe antibiotics for any infection. Those caring for a rabbit should also check their ears periodically (biweekly) for any sign of ear mites, as it is also rather common, especially in outdoor rabbits. Flystrike is also another rabbit issue which occurs when flies lay their eggs in a rabbit\u2019s soiled coat (usually on their bottom). Lack of appetite, lethargy and/or sudden yelps of agony can be signs of flystrike. Immediately take your rabbit to your local veterinarian if you believe it has flystrike, as it could be deadly. The English Spot Rabbit may shed, but because its coat fibers are so short, you won\u2019t notice it too much. This well-mannered rabbit is a wonderful choice for singles, couples, families and seniors who are looking a low-maintenance pet. They are gentle, affectionate and have just enough energy and spunk to make them interesting companions. Because they have been bred to be used as show pets, they are very much used to being petted, held and handled overall by humans, which makes them great pets. Unlike other pets such as dogs and cats, rabbits are a little bit trickier to litter train. With lots of time, patience and rewards, rabbits can be potty trained \u2013 it simply takes them longer to understand. Instead of using just one litter box, try to spread a couple around the house so they won\u2019t be tempted to do it in a corner. With lots of patience, rewards and time, you can potty train your rabbit as well as teach them some other nifty tricks such as stay, come and jump! Rabbits should be given a few toys to nibble on whether they are inside or outside so they don\u2019t destroy any of your personal property. Whether your rabbit ignores the more complex, expensive toy or likes it is completely up to the rabbit, as they all have their own personalities and enjoy different toys.

Thought to be a native of the Western Europe since the Roman times, the European Rabbit first evolved around 4,000 years ago, on the territory of today\u2019s Spain. After millennia of life in meadows and woodlands, European Rabbit now has a near-threatened conservation status. The habitat of the common rabbit, as this species is also referred to, is throughout Europe and in Northwest Africa, but they have been introduced to South America, Australia, and New Zealand. Unfortunately, in Australia, the European Rabbit became an invasive species and is now considered a pest, as it causes damage to agriculture and threatens Australia\u2019s complex biodiversity. The European Rabbit is the ancestor of approximately 80 different breeds of domestic rabbits. The European Rabbit was the foundation for all of the breeds that exist today, as the first of the rabbit breeds were created by selectively breeding the wild common rabbit. The ears are upright and relatively long, with a muted dark color of the tips. Their tails are short and fluffy, and they have a semi-arch or mandolin body shape. In comparison with other rabbit breeds, The European Rabbit falls into the category of small rabbits, as adult specimens weigh between 2.25 and 5.5 lbs. The fur of the European Rabbit is soft but thick enough to protect them from the harsh weather. European Rabbits are endothermic, which means they need to be able to generate heat internally, so their coat is the only thing that prevents them from freezing in the winter or overheating in the summer. Considered of normal type, their coat is short to medium length. There is no distinction between does and bucks when it comes to their appearance, apart from the fact that the males of the species tend to be slightly bigger, with broader heads. Even though there are some variations to the physical traits due to the fact it\u2019s a wild breed, European Rabbit\u2019s coat is usually greyish-brown, with black and reddish hair sometimes present in the coat and giving it a beautiful shine.  Their underside is paler, with a light grey or brown on the stomach, and white under the tail. Melanistic European Rabbits are not unusual to see, so instead of typical brownish and grey, these rabbits can come in much darker shades or completely black. These rabbits have a distinct brownish-grey coat that helps them survive harsh, cold winters in the wild. Even though European Rabbits live in the wild, instead as family pets, their basic needs are not that much different than those of most domestic breeds. Their diet consists of herbs, grass, and twigs. In populated areas, they also have access to agricultural crops, so they eat fruits and veggies as well. The roughage like twigs or dried grass (hay) helps these rabbits grind down their teeth, and meets all the nutritional needs this species has. During the winter, these cute wild rabbits nibble on bulbs, remaining plants, and bark of trees. They are nocturnal ground dwellers, and they make their home out of grassland areas, like field or parks, or woodland patches. Their habitat needs to allow them to easily make cover from the many animals that pose a threat to their survival, and where they can dig burrows in which they live. The European Rabbits are well known for their unique burrow system (evident in their Latin name), as they create a complex system of interwoven tunnels in the ground known as \u201cwarrens\u201d. Hundreds of rabbits can live in a warren, where they raise their young and stay safe from dangers of the wild. Unfortunately, although common rabbits can live up to 9 years, most of them never live over one year, due to hunters, animal predators, and diseases. As they are considered an invasive species, viruses deliberately introduced into their habitat are the most significant health threats for the European Rabbit. Virus such as Myxomatosis can cause fatigue, fever, skin tumors and blindness in rabbits, and the infected rabbits die within 14 days of contracting it. The virus very contagious and spreads easily, either by close contact with other diseases rabbits, or mosquito and flea bite. One of the more devastating viruses that affect the common rabbit is viral haemorrhagic disease, a highly infectious virus which causes death in the 24 hours after the infection occurs. Of course, not unlike pet rabbits, wild European rabbits can have internal parasites or suffer from bacterial and fungal infections. European Rabbits have a near-threatened conservation status because of their many natural predators, hunters, and deliberately introduced viruses. As a non-domesticated species, European Rabbits are wary of humans and easily scared. These rabbits are not meant to be pets, being raised in captivity will significantly shorten their lifespan. Although not very friendly when it comes to people, these rabbits are social when it comes to other members of their breed. They are primarily solitary animals, but can form a group of up to 20 rabbits inside one warren. The members of the group look for food together and mate. Unless you\u2019re a professional that is educated and trained in rehabilitation of wildlife species, you shouldn\u2019t try to handle or raise European Rabbits.", "facts": " Semi-Arch/ Mandolin Outdoor Shy, solitary, skittish", "tags": "domestic rabbit, Europe, european rabbit, social rabbits, Spain, wild rabbit, "}, "fauve de bourgogne rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/fauve-de-bourgogne-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fauve-de-bourgogne.jpg", "name": "Fauve de Bourgogne Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Fauve de Bourgogne Rabbit is one of the oldest breeds from France. It originated within the Burgundy region of the country, and it was developed through the selective breeding of rabbits that were fawn colored. In 1928, the breed was officially recognized. Today, this breed is considered rare, as these rabbits are not commonly found outside of their home country. In France, though, they are still popular, even though these rabbits were originally bred for their fur and meat. In addition to making great family pets, these rabbits are also beloved show animals. The Fauve de Bourgogne is a rabbit breed from France. The body of the Fauve de Bourgogne Rabbit can be described as muscular, round, and thickset. Also, the head will be large and broad, and the neck will be strong and short. You will also notice that the ears will be strong and well furred, will be held upright, and will feature rounded tips. The coat of a Fauve de Bourgogne Rabbit should be medium in length. There will also be a dense undercoat. One of the most distinguishing features of the Fauve de Bourgogne Rabbit is its beautiful fur, which is a lovely orange-red color. This russet red is the only color that this breed features. Fauve de Bourgogne Rabbits have a lovely orange-red coat. The Fauve de Bourgogne Rabbit will do best when housed indoors, protected from predators and extreme temperatures. However, you should allow your rabbit out of his indoor enclosure in order to roam about freely and exercise every day. Rabbit-proofing your house will ensure your pet doesn\u2019t end up chewing any of your valuable belongings or your cables and wires. Whether or not you house your rabbit outside, you should give your pet the opportunity to explore the great outdoors. Using a lawn enclosure, exercise pen, or extension hutch will provide a safe and secure space where your rabbit can get some fresh air and sunshine. Any rabbit, regardless of whether he is being housed indoors or outside, should have an enclosure that is safe, quiet, and clean. It should also be large enough that your rabbit can stand up, turn around, and hop around comfortably. An outdoor enclosure, in particular, should also be weatherproof and waterproof, and it should be kept out of direct wind and direct sunlight. To give your Fauve de Bourgogne Rabbit the best nutrition, focus on providing your pet with a variety of vegetables, but you can also give him some fruit as a treat. For example, you can feed your rabbit some dark, leafy greens that include spring greens, romaine lettuce, spinach, and kale, and then provide him with other types of veggies, such as cauliflower, summer squash, bell pepper, and broccoli. Starchy vegetables and fruits should be given only occasionally, as you do not want your pet to consume too much of those foods. Rabbits also require an array of high quality hays and grasses, as well as rabbit pellets. And, of course, you should always make certain that your pet has access to clean, fresh drinking water. Rabbits like the Fauve de Bourgogne can be susceptible to infections and colds, so keeping your pet in a stress-free environment that is free of sudden temperature changes and drafts will be important. A pet rabbit can also become vulnerable to ear mites and conjunctivitis, as well as intestinal problems like coccidiosis, hairball obstructions, and bloat. Interacting with your pet every day will give you the chance to check his body, ears, eyes, and mouth for any signs of illness. Also be sure to give your rabbit plenty of gnaw toys and fibrous veggies that will help ensure his teeth never become overgrown. And making it a point to keep your rabbit at the ideal weight will also prevent problems like flystrike, which is more common in overweight rabbits who are unable to properly groom themselves. You can even talk to your vet about having your pet treated for ticks, worms, and fleas, especially if he spends time in the great outdoors. And you can also have your rabbit vaccinated, spayed, or neutered. The Fauve de Bourgogne is known for being gentle and docile. The Fauve de Bourgogne Rabbit is known for being gentle and docile in temperament, making it a great choice for those who are seeking a family pet.

Some say they are descendants from Patagonian and/or Stone rabbits, which were breeds raised for their meat and fur. Others say they are descendants of the Argentinian Patagonian rabbit \u2013 questions concerning their history continue to be unanswered. What we do know is that this breed came from Belgium and England to America in the 1890s and it wasn\u2019t until the early 1900s that the breed began to make appearances in livestock shows. The National Federation of Flemish Giant Rabbit Breeders (NFFGRB) was formed in 1915 and when the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) was formed in 1924, the NFFGRB became part of that association. The Flemish Giant became an ARBA recognized breed in 1929. The Flemish Giant Rabbit has a glossy, short and dense coat. True to their name, the Flemish Giant Rabbit is indeed an imposingly large breed. On average, these popular rabbits weigh 15 pounds on average once they are fully grown. Granted, there are much bigger specimens of the breed recorded, with males weighing up to 22 pounds and females up to 20 pounds. But, while it\u2019s undeniable that their impressive size is the most striking thing about these rabbits, it\u2019s not the only appearance trait that appeals to bunny owners. A Flemish Giant Rabbit will have a mandolin or semi-arched body shape, with a well-defined rise starting near the shoulders. The highest point of the body\u2019s arch is at the hip, giving them a graceful appearance. Their bodies are long and strong, well-muscled but not fat. Males (bucks) have a broader, more massive head than females (does) who can also have a dewlap. The usual length of these rabbits is about 20 inches, but one Flemish Giant Rabbit made history when it became the longest recorded rabbit- at a whopping 4 feet and 3 inches. The ears are erect, thick and around 5 inches in height.   The Flemish Giant\u2019s coat is glossy, short and dense. This is the so-called rollback fur. Because it is not long like that of the Angoras, for example, they do not require much grooming. Regular brushing with a slicker brush will be more than enough to keep their hair lustrous and soft.  Rabbits tend to shed more than usual during the springtime months, so make sure to increase the grooming frequency at that time. It\u2019s important to help your pet get rid of loose hair, otherwise, they can end up ingesting most of it, which leads to serious health issues. The ARBA accepts only seven varieties of the Flemish Giant Rabbit. This includes the following colors: sandy, fawn, white, light gray, steel grey, black and blue. The ARBA does not accept any combinations of color, also known as \u201cbroken patterns\u201d Many Flemish Giants play with other dogs and can be seen cuddling alongside them. This particular rabbit can live in indoor or outdoor enclosures/cages, depending on the owner\u2019s housing situation. Outdoor rabbits should have a hutch, however they should not have any stairs or ramps leaving to another level because of its size. Either indoor/outdoor enclosures need to be large enough so your Flemish Giant Rabbit can stretch out and hop inside of it. As a rule of thumb, for this giant breed, this would mean a minimum of 3 feet by 4 feet. Some owners have found out that large dog crates work perfectly well for their rabbit and have set the inside to cater to their rabbit\u2019s needs. In any case, rabbit cages need to have a solid bottom (not wire) and need to be laid with bedding. Bedding needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. Regardless of how spacious and comfy their enclosure is, Flemish Giants will need to spend plenty of time outside of it. Keeping a bunny full-time in a cage is cruel, especially when you have a large, active breed such as this one. On a daily basis, let out your rabbit to hop about freely and explore his environment at his own pace. In case they are indoors, thoroughly bunny proof the room before letting them out. All bunnies are big chewers, but Flemish Giant especially so, as they have the strength to make even more damage if you let them. Protecting furniture from bunnies and bunnies from electric cables is a must if you want your pet to play safely and without any destructive consequences for your belongings.  For those rabbits who get to play in a yard, make sure to securely fence the area where you are letting them roam and always supervise them. Flemish Giant Might be a bit big for most predators (but still, not for all!) but there\u2019s still a possibility of them hopping over a fence or finding a hole to go through. When it comes to nutrition, Flemish Giant\u2019s diet is no different than any other rabbit breed \u2013 they only need more food because of their size. They enjoy a diet comprised mostly and hay (about 70 percent). They also enjoy fresh fruits and vegetables including carrots, watercress, red or green lettuce, celery, mango, pear, and peach. Select leafy greens can also be added into their diet so long as they do not have high water content. They also enjoy daily pellets \u2013 adult rabbits will eat about 1/4 cup of high-fiber pellets everyday for every five pounds they weigh. Considering this rabbit\u2019s size, they do require quite a lot of food so financial responsibility is definitely needed in order to properly feed them.  Besides having sore hocks as a direct result of wire-bottomed cage, Flemish Giants are not particularly susceptible to any hereditary disease or health complication. Having said that, there are a few health problems you need to be aware of before purchasing a rabbit.The most common issue with rabbits is overgrown teeth- unlike most animals, their teeth just keep on growing as long as they live. Usually, rabbits who have a high-fiber diet of hay won\u2019t have these issues, as their teeth wear down from chewing on roughage.  However, if you find your rabbit\u2019s teeth seem to be growing a little faster than they are wearing down, provide straw or wicker mats, rabbit-safe blocks of wood or straw baskets. These are a great way for them to have fun and wear down those teeth to boot. Seventy percent of their diet should be hay, though, so make sure you\u2019re not skimping on hay in favor of fruits and veggies. Rabbit ears also need to be checked regularly for ear mites, which is more common with outdoor rabbits than indoor ones. Finally, they should also be given a pea-sized amount of de-worming paste twice a year as a preventative measure. Other issues include sniffles, GI stasis, or infectious diseases. In case you notice anything amiss with your bunny, from eye discharge to constipation or simple unusual behavior, contact a veterinarian that specializes in small animals.    The Flemish Giant is also known as \u201cUniversal Rabbit\u201d and \u201cGentle Giant.\u201d The Flemish Giant rabbit has two nicknames \u2013 the \u201cUniversal Rabbit\u201d because of it is a breed that serves all four rabbit purposes (meat, show, coat and pet) and a \u201cGentle Giant\u201d because it is so well-mannered and docile. Despite its large size, they are a recommended rabbit breed for first-time owner, as they are relatively low maintenance and have sweet personalities. This also makes them great pets for singles, couples and families with children of any age. Because they are so large, children should not attempt to pick this rabbit up but instead play with them while they are on the ground (which means stroking their fur, nuzzling them, petting them, etc). A great advantage with this breed being so large is that some owners have found that dog harnesses for medium-sized dog breeds fit this rabbit well. There are some who enjoy taking their rabbit out in the back/front yard on the harness, and if your yard is not fenced, putting your rabbit on a leash is a great idea. Be sure to slowly introduce the harness and reward them when they have made progress. Like other rabbit breeds, their personalities will also flourish when given some toys they can chew and play with. This can include balls, rabbit-safe wooden blocks and toys purchased from your local pet store. Rabbits do not generally become upset or possessive over toys, so having children play with their toys while they are around should not be a problem, especially because Flemish Giants are so well-mannered. Unlike some rabbit breeds, Flemish Giants generally do well with other animals in the house as well so long as the other animal don\u2019t mind the rabbit\u2019s presence. There are many cases of Flemish Giants playing with other dogs (generally larger ones like Labradors, Golden Retrievers, etc.) and can be seen cuddling alongside them when they are in their beds/loungers as well. This breed of rabbit is intelligent so training them to obey basic commands as well as potty training may be slightly easier than other rabbit breeds (however compared to cats and dogs, still challenging). With lots of patience, time and rewards, your rabbit will understand the connection.", "facts": " Semi-Arch/Mandolin Rabbits for Singles, House Rabbits, Families with children, First-time owners, Indoor/Outdoor enclosures  Friendly, docile, sweet", "tags": "flemish giant, flemish giant origin, giant rabbit breeds, rabbits for families, rabbits for kids, rabbits for singles, "}, "florida white rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/florida-white-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/florida-white.jpg", "name": "Florida White Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Judge Orville Miliken wanted to develop an \u201call-purpose\u201d rabbit, which meant the rabbit had to be show-worthy, have a high-quality coat, ample meat as well as have the docile qualities of a good pet rabbit. Another reason for the breed\u2019s creation is that Mr. Miliken realized that laboratories that were using New Zealand rabbits as test subjects would prefer their rabbits to be smaller, so he tried to meet their need by creating a new breed of rabbit. The judge mated an albino Dutch, a red-eyed-white Polish rabbit and a white New Zealand rabbit back in the 1960s in order to create a new breed he aptly named after his home state of Florida. It was accepted into the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) in 1967 and ten years later, the Florida White Rabbit won its first \u201cBest in Show\u201d (BIS) at an ARBA convention. While primarily developed for its potential commercial purposes, the Florida White Rabbit quickly became a popular pet. Today, the majority of these bunnies live in homes, as family members and cherished companions. Read on to find out if the Florida White Rabbit is a good choice for you! The Florida White rabbit is a wonderful pet for practically any stage of a person\u2019s life. The Florida White rabbit is a relatively small rabbit with a round, compact body and a short neck. Their body type is commercial and the appearance of their body is the most important for show judges. A Florida White Rabbit should weight between 4 and 6 pounds, be fine-boned buy with a well-developed body. Their thick ears are not large and generally stand upright, but can fall on either side of their small, round heads. Hindquarters, back, and shoulders are well muscled, especially for such a small rabbit. The hind part of their body is somewhat wider than it is at the shoulders. This rabbit\u2019s coat is short and soft, and they do not tend to shed much, so weekly grooming with a bristled brush should be fine. If you find your Florida White rabbit is shedding more than usual, it may be because it is shedding season. If this is the case, increase your brushings to twice or three times a week. The only coat color this rabbit comes in is white, with its eyes a bright red hue. There are no markings or patterns. Florida Whites are perfect pets for singles, couples and seniors who would like some furry company. One of the primary reasons the Florida White Rabbit was created in the first place is to have a rabbit for commercial purposes that would be less demanding than other similar but bigger breeds. Needless to say, the breeders developing the breed managed to achieve just that. When fully mature, the Florida White weighs between 4 and 6 pounds, so unlike their New Zealand cousins, they won\u2019t need a very big enclosure to feel comfortable. For a rabbit of their size, a good rule of thumb is to get a cage that\u2019s 24\u2033 by 36\u2033 in size. Your bunny should be able to comfortably stretch, hop, and sit up in an enclosure of the dimensions.  Rabbits are chewers, so it\u2019s important to have a cage that\u2019s made from rabbit-safe and sturdy materials. Usually, powder-coated or galvanized wire make a good choice. However, make sure that the bottom of the cage is not naked wire as it can hurt your bunny\u2019s feet and cause sore hocks. Instead, cover it with bunny-friendly bedding that would make the surface softer. Shredded paper, sawdust, wood pellets or hay are all good choices. The bedding should be regularly replaced to keep everything clean and smelling fresh. This is especially true if your bunny isn\u2019t litter trained and goes potty right on the bedding of their cage.  If you plan on keeping a Florida White Rabbit as a pet, it is preferable to place their habitat inside your home, so they could socialize and become a part of the family. They can live comfortably in a spacious hutch that\u2019s placed in a shed outside, but this could make them less accustomed to interaction with family members.  In any case, you will have to make sure they also spend some time outside their hutch or cage. Let them hop about a bunny-proofed room and explore their environment at their own pace. Some people give their rabbits the freedom of the room with their cage being a place to retreat to for sleep or eating rather than full time home. Also, if you have a securely fenced backyard you could let your bunny play outside, too. Just make to supervise them as they could easily get hurt or lost if left to play on their own. Their diet should consist of high-quality hay (70 percent), rabbit pellets, leafy greens and fresh veggies (30 percent). Fresh, clean water should always be provided, as well. The Florida White rabbit is not susceptible to any particular health problems, but as with any animal, preventative measures must be taken to ensure they are happy and healthy. Rabbits that are indoor for most of their lives sometimes develop Vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to a host of problems. To ensure your rabbit doesn\u2019t develop this deficiency, either take them outdoors for some fresh air and sunshine or bring them to an indoor room that has plenty of windows where they can roam in the sunshine. Be sure to check out rabbit\u2019s ears for any earwax buildup and/or mites, and bring them to the veterinarian should you see anything worrisome or out of the ordinary. Also monitor the inside of their mouth for overgrown teeth, as this can happen when a rabbit does not have a proper hay diet (hay is important not only to their general health, but also because it wears down their teeth which continuously grow throughout their entire lives). Most Florida Whites are docile, laid-back animals who like to check out their surroundings on their own clock. Be sure to socialize your rabbit as soon as you can, preferably when they are still young kits. Socializing animals means taking the time to bring them out of their enclosures, petting them and introducing them to young children and other animals. Because of the sweet, docile natures, rabbits tend to do best when they are the only animal in the house. The Florida White rabbit is a wonderful pet for practically any stage of a person\u2019s life. Parents can teach their young children how to care and love for a small animal, as they learn what it means to responsible for a pet. This rabbit is relatively quiet and depending on their personality, may be on the slightly lazier or slightly more active side. Florida Whites are perfect pets for singles, couples and seniors who would like some furry company. While they do not require an abundance of toys like other pets, they do enjoy the occasional play thing to chew on. Rabbits tend to be a little harder to litter train than other animals such as cats, dogs and birds, however it is possible. Unlike cats, rabbits may need to have a few litter boxes spread out across the house but with some patience and rewarding, they should be able to understand that there are some places where it is acceptable to do the deed.", "facts": " Compact Singles, Seniors, Apartment/House Rabbit, young children, First-time owners, Indoor Rabbits Friendly, quiet, relaxed, docile", "tags": "apartment rabbits, florida white rabbit, friendly rabbits, kid-friendly rabbit breeds, rabbits for families, rabbits for kids, "}, "french angora rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/french-angora-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/french-angora.jpg", "name": "French Angora Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Out of all five Angora rabbit breeds (of which four are recognized by the ARBA), the French Angora rabbit is arguably the closest in resembling the \u201coriginal\u201d Angora that was brought from Ankara (Angora), Turkey in 1723 to France by sailors. The first Angora to set foot in America was called the \u201cAngora Wooler\u201d and there was no differentiation between French, English, Giant, or Satin Angora. It was only in 1944 that the ARBA split these four different kinds of breeds. Today, the French Angora is the second most popular Angora breed (just behind the English). French Angoras are docile, sweet rabbits who love to hop around freely, whether indoors or out. The French Angora Rabbit has a commercial-type body and a strong, sturdy frame. Unlike their English counterparts, French Angoras do not have facial furnishings. They can have minor tufting on the rear legs with the rest of their bodies being covered in coarse guard hair and crimped underwool. While the French Angora rabbit is low maintenance in terms of diet bedding, they do require most attention in the coat department. The French Angora\u2019s coat is called wool, as it can be spun to make articles of clothing. In order to have clean, mat-free wool, you need to clean and tend to their coat. This means regular brushings on an as-needed basis (this may be as often as everyday to as little as once a week), as well as regular blow-dryings to keep their coat separate and clean (since rabbits cannot and should not take baths\u2026 this makes them anxious and can cause cardiac problems, sometimes resulting in death). Their coat can grow as much as six inches every season, although the ideal length is about two to three inches. This means rabbit owners need to take the time to shear or trim their French Angora\u2019s wool 3-4 times a year. The French Angora rabbit has a long list of coat colors and markings. The Pointed White Angoras are pure white in color with markings on the nose, ears, feet and nails. The \u201cSelf Group\u201d include blue- and ruby-eyed white rabbits, Black (dark slate wool and brown eyes), Blue (slightly lighter than black coat with blue-grey eyes), Chocolate (light brown wool with brown eyes) and Lilac (pinky, dove-grey wool with blue/gray eyes). The \u201cAgouti\u201d Group: consists of: Chestnut (wool color is a blend of pearl and blue with brown eyes), Chocolate Agouti (rich brown wool with bands of tan and brown eyes), Copper (roughish red wool with jet black tips, bands of red-orange and brown eyes), Lynx (light tan-colored wool with bands of tan or light lilac and blue/gray eyes), and Opal (primarily blue wool with bands of tan and blue/gray eyes). The \u201cChinchilla\u201d varieties of Angoras include Chinchilla (wool is a blend of slate and pearl with alternating bands of pearl and blue/gray with eyes of any shade), Chocolate Chinchilla (brown and pearl-colored wool with bands of pearl/chocolate with eyes any shade of blue/gray, brown or marbled), Lilac Chinchilla (wool is a blend of lilac and pearl, with one or more bands of pearl or lilac with blue/gray eyes) and Squirrel (blue/gray wool with one or more band of similar colors and blue/gray eyes). There are three more kinds of Angora color listings including the \u201cShaded Group,\u201d which is Pearl, Sable, Seal, Smoke Pearl, Blue Tortoiseshell, Lilac Tortoiseshell, Chocolate Tortoiseshell and Tortoiseshell. The \u201cTicked Group\u201d features Blue Steel, Chocolate Steel, Lilac Steel and Steel colors, while the \u201cWide Band Group\u201d has Cream, Fawn and Red colors with their own distinctive markings. French Angoras have a long list of coat colors and markings. Whether you decide to keep your French Angora Rabbit indoors or out, all pet rabbits need plenty of time outside of their enclosures and with their human family to become well-socialized bunnies. This means taking them out of their enclosure to let them roam around freely in your home or outside in your fenced yard where they are protected from other animals and escapes into a neighbor\u2019s yard. Outdoor rabbits should have sturdy enclosures that are raised from the ground in order to protect them from predators such as raccoons, wolves and coyotes. They should also have a ramp that descends onto the fenced bottom \u201cfloor\u201d so they can feel soft grass or ground beneath their feet whenever they please. Indoor rabbits should have plastic enclosures that are large enough for them to easily stretch out their long bodies, and still have plenty of room leftover. Skip wire cages, which are uncomfortable and can hurt your rabbit\u2019s feet in the long run. Opt to have bedding line the bottom of your rabbit\u2019s enclosure \u2013 while it does take a little more time to maintain, it will make your bunny happier. Be sure to spot-clean the cage and remove droppings daily and completely replace the bedding every week. Finally, a rabbit\u2019s diet should consist mostly of good-quality hay (about 70 percent), with the remainder being a balance of fruits, vegetables, pellets and leafy greens. Be sure to talk to your local veterinarian to find out which kind of rabbit food is best for every stage of your bunny\u2019s life, as younger rabbits have a more specific diet than older ones. Due to their thick, dense fur, French Angoras are most susceptible to wool block. Rabbits are clean creatures and as such, they groom themselves often. Rabbits tend to swallow a small amount of fur every time they groom themselves however unlike cats, they cannot regurgitate their wool. The wool grows and grows inside their bellies, making them feel full or unable to eat. Symptoms of wool block includes a loss of appetite, less droppings and an overall less energetic bunny. Always keep an eye on how much your rabbit is eating and if you suspect your rabbit is experiencing wool block, take them to your local veterinarian immediately. Like other rabbits, Angoras also are at-risk for overgrown teeth, which can grow into their jaws and face, causing immense pain. A balanced diet consisting mostly of hay should be enough to prevent wool block, as well as overgrown teeth. Does can be spayed when they are as young as 4 months, however veterinarians tend to wait until the female rabbit is six months old just to be safe \u2013 the older they are, the less risk the surgery poses.  Bucks can be neutered as young as 3 1/2 months old. The French Angora rabbit needs plenty of time outside of its enclosure with their human family to become well-socialized bunnies. The French Angora rabbit was originally bred for two particular uses: meat and wool purposes. However, that isn\u2019t to say that they don\u2019t also make excellent pets so long as they are given plenty of love, attention and affection. Angoras as a whole are docile, sweet rabbits who love to hop around freely, whether indoors or out. The more time they spend socializing out of their enclosures, the friendlier and sweeter they become. Like humans, every rabbit has their own distinct personalities and when they are exposed to humans, their personalities really flourish. They do well with couples who are ready to take the leap into pet parenthood as well as families who have older children who understand how to handle larger animals such as rabbits. Unlike other pets such as dogs and cats, rabbits are a little bit tricker to litter train. With lots of time, patience and rewards, rabbits can be potty trained but it takes much longer than other pets. Instead of using just one litter box, try to spread a couple around the house so they won\u2019t be tempted to do it in a corner because they cannot hold it in. When rabbit parents find that their bunny tends to do their business where they are not supposed to (such as their favorite corner in the living room), they put a litter box in that particular area and sometimes, that is enough to make the rabbit understand that this is where they need to do the deed. However, rabbits do enjoy to have some toys like any other animal does, else they may go and gnaw and something they aren\u2019t supposed to, like your brand new shoes. Choose rabbit-safe toys or rabbit-safe blocks of wood to entertain your rabbit and your new heels should get away scott-free.", "facts": " Commercial Rabbits for Singles,  House Rabbits, Families with older children, Indoor Rabbits, Outdoor Rabbits Friendly, calm, gentle, docile", "tags": "angora rabbit, french angora rabbit, gentle rabbits, kid-friendly rabbits, rabbits for families, Wool Block, "}, "french lop": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/french-lop/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/french-lop.jpg", "name": "French Lop", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Believed to have been bred using an English Lop and a French Butterfly rabbit, the French Lop was mostly used as a meat animal when it was first bred in France around 1850. This rabbit rose in popularity in neighboring European countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium and even Germany. In 1933, it was reported that approximately 10 French Lops were brought over from the Netherlands and exhibited in the United Kingdom, although it wasn\u2019t until the 60\u2019s that they became popular in the UK. Finally, these lovely rabbits made their way overseas to the United States circa 1970-1971. The French Lop is a large breed of rabbit that makes for a wonderful pet, due to their calm, docile temperament. This rabbit resembled the Flemish Giant of today, but weighs more and is shorter in body length. They are a large rabbit breed with short, straight front legs and hind legs that run parallel to the body. Their ears are usually 5-8 inches long and hang just below the jaw, but aren\u2019t as long as the English Lop\u2019s. French Lops also have a thick body and a large head with a wide forehead and chubby cheeks. This rabbit\u2019s rollback coat is dense, short and soft. Because it isn\u2019t very long, their coat is not appropriate to spin in order to make wool, but they do shed more in particular seasons. During off-season shedding times, one brushing a week with a bristled brush should be sufficient. When springtime rolls around, increase their brushings to twice or three times a week (if necessary). French Lops can come in a variety of different colors both solid and broken. These colors include white, brown, blue, black, opal, fawn, chinchilla (grey), steel and Siamese (cream and brown). They do not have any particular markings that defines their breed from any other rabbit breed. When socialized at a young age, a French Lop will stick by your side wherever you go. A French Lop\u2019s diet does not differ from any other rabbit breed. It should be 70 percent hay (there are several types of hay/rabbit-friendly grass available on the market), with the remaining 30 percent being a healthy mix of pellets, fruits, vegetables and leafy greens. Research what kind of fruits, vegetables and greens are rabbit-friendly and if you\u2019re not sure if a particular food can be eaten, the rule of thumb is simply not to give it to them. Stop, research, and/or ask your veterinarian if it is bunny-safe before feeding. Due to its large side, French Lop enclosures need to be bigger than a typical rabbit cage. Whether it is indoor or outdoor, the enclosure needs to have adequate space for your rabbit to stretch its body comfortably, relax, and still have plenty of space to move about. Outdoor enclosures need to have protection from the elements such as cold, sun, rain, heat, etc. Always be aware of the temperature, weather and if predators are around your area such as coyotes. It is for that reason that outdoor enclosures should be raised from the ground and should have a ramp that leads to the ground \u201cfloor\u201d so they can roam around there as well. These giant bunnies need just as much time outside of their enclosures as smaller rabbits. They require time to roam around freely, hopping about either in the safety of your home or outdoors in a fenced backyard where they can feel the ground and grass beneath their feet. When socialized at a young age, these rabbits will stick by your side wherever you go. They make excellent indoor rabbits so long as they are given lots of time to roam out of their cages. The French Lop does not have any health issues particular to its breed, however rabbit owners should check their pets for particular problems such as overgrown teeth. Overgrown teeth occur when the rabbit has a poor diet that does not consist mainly of hay, which slowly grinds their teeth down naturally. If your rabbit does not eat as much, doesn\u2019t eat at all, has fewer droppings or just doesn\u2019t seem to be him/herself, be sure to check their mouth for signs of overgrown teeth, which can grow into their jaw or face and be extremely painful. A proper diet is also important to ensure other digestive problems don\u2019t develop. For example, if your rabbit develops diarrhea because of a poor diet, their soiled coat can attract flies in the warmer months (especially if it is outdoors) and if the rabbit is unable to groom himself properly, the flies can lay eggs in his fur (near the bottom). When those eggs hatch, they will begin to eat your rabbit while they are still alive, causing them extreme pain- this is called flystrike. To avoid this, make sure your rabbit eats a balanced diet and check their fur for any flies that may have landed on soiled fur. The French Lop also has a tendency to become a little overweight, which most rabbit parents don\u2019t notice because of its already large size. Being overweight can cause a multitude of other health issues so always be aware of how much you are feeding your gentle giant. The French Lop thrives on human interaction and loves to be picked up and petted. This large breed of rabbit makes for a wonderful pet due to their calm, docile temperament. While they do well with adults and older children who are able to tend to them properly (such as not pulling their ears/fur/etc), they can be good with smaller children as well so long as both animal and child is well socialized.  Because of their large size, they wouldn\u2019t make great apartment dwellers or for first-time rabbit owners. Smaller creatures are best taken care of by a first-time rabbit parent. Having said that, these gentle giants have a huge personality each different than the other rabbit. At first glance, it can be mistaken as a small dog but make no mistake about it, this rabbit is just as cuddly as any dog you\u2019ve ever had. They thrive on human interaction and love to be picked up and petted, making them ideal for couples who want to take the next step into pet parenthood or singles who would like some animal companionship. Always remember that unlike other animals, rabbits will chew on anything you leave around that is chewable: everything is fair game to them. While French Lops don\u2019t have a tendency to destroy/chew things more than any other rabbit breed, always make sure to keep your rabbit occupied with a few toys that they can gnash their teeth on, else they may go after something that isn\u2019t bite-friendly like your new pair of loafers. With plenty of patience and reward training, rabbits are also litter-trainable.", "facts": " Commercial Rabbits for singles,  Rabbits for couples, House rabbits, Families with older children, Indoor rabbits, experienced owners, Outdoor rabbits Affectionate, playful, gentle,  docile", "tags": "best pet rabbit breeds, french lop rabbit, friendly rabbits, pet rabbits, rabbits for couples, rabbits for experienced owners, rabbits for singles, "}, "german angora rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/german-angora-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/german-angora-rabbit.jpg", "name": "German Angora Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "During the 1920s, in Germany, Angora breeders wanted to improve the breed for commercial purposes. They started from breed that was most similar to today\u2019s English Angora, which produced around 200 grams of wool per year. In 1960s, selective breeding led to German Angora Rabbit breed producing over 1000 grams of wool per year, only to make a new record in the past decade, when their production hit the 2000-gram goal. This breed is not recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association, as it was deemed that it lacks distinct traits. Although it has a different quality of fur, German Angora is still quite similar to the English Angora in terms of body shape and overall appearance. However, this breed has its own association, The International Association of German Angora Rabbit Breeders. In Europe, this breed is just called Angora (bred according to German standards). The German Angora Rabbit is a friendly, long-haired rabbit that makes a great family pet. Apart from their beautiful coats, the German Angora rabbits are best known for the interesting furnishings on their face and ears, commonly known as tassels. Their ears are upright and well-haired, with tufts of hair on the top. Considered to be large-sized, these rabbits can weigh from 5.5 lbs to 12 lbs. Their bodies are very symmetrical and of cylindrical shape, being at the same width and height, and of medium length. All Angoras are treasured for their fluffy fur, but the German Angora Rabbit outperforms all of its relatives.  Their hair is long, very fine and woolen. Even though Angora rabbits usually have high-maintenance fur, the German variety of the breed is popular for the effortless upkeep of the coat. Their woolly hair will not shed, as they have the non-molt gene. Their fur is extremely resistant to matting, and they don\u2019t need to be brushed or groomed. However, every 3 months, these rabbits need to be sheared. Their wool can be spun into yarn, as their production is abundant and the quality of hair outstanding. The German Angora Rabbit comes in all monochromatic colors, but the most common is REW or ruby-eyed white rabbit. In case of colored rabbits, the color of their coat is never uniform. Their undercoat is always lighter than the top of the fur, which appears in a more intense, vibrant hue. Markings or patterns of the coat are rare, as they are not allowed in breeding standards, and, as such, considered an undesirable trait. The German Angora Rabbit\u2019s coat is woolly, and when sheared, it can be spun into soft, luxurious yarn. Not unlike all long-haired rabbit breeds, the German Angora will require a little extra effort to stay healthy and happy. The most important care requirements of the breed are its diet and grooming needs. When it comes to feeding German Angora rabbits, they\u2019ll happily nibble on veggies, fruits, and rabbit pellets, same as any other bunny. But the majority of their diet needs to consist of hay. Roughage such as hay helps Angoras with the wool block, and it\u2019s a problem that affects the German variety of the breed even more. As they produce a lot of wool, it\u2019s only logical to assume that bigger amounts of the hair end up in their digestive system while they are grooming themselves. These rabbits can be kept both indoors and outdoors, both, in both cases, their living environment must be safe and comfortable. If you\u2019re planning on keeping a German Angora in your home, you\u2019ll need an enclosure of appropriate size. Their crate should be large enough for them to be able to stand on their hind legs and freely walk around. The bottom should be padded with rabbit-friendly bedding and changed frequently to maintain the hygiene inside the enclosure. The requirements for outdoor enclosure are the same, except you\u2019ll need to provide them protection from extreme temperatures and potential predators as well. Sweet-natured and affectionate, the German Angora rabbits will love playing with their owners. When you\u2019re letting them to go outdoors, you\u2019ll need to monitor them the whole time. Allow them to play only in fenced parts of your yards, where no other animal could harm them and where they can\u2019t get lost. During their playtime indoors, make sure that no electric cables or valuables are lying around. Rabbits love to nibble on stuff, and there are a lot of thing in anyone\u2019s home that could seriously harm the rabbit if they chew on them. In general, the German Angora Rabbit is a healthy, sturdy breed. The only breed-specific issues that can arise can be prevented with good care and a grooming routine. As they have lush, fluffy coats, these rabbits often swallow a lot of their hair while grooming themselves. This can lead to wool block, as previously mentioned, often referred to as GI stasis. This is a serious, life-threatening condition, which is why it\u2019s essential to catch it in its early stages. Unfortunately, this means you\u2019ll have to pay close attention to your rabbit\u2019s poop. Constipation, small and dry poop, or the so-called \u201cstring of pearls\u201d (poop connected by strands of hair) are the most common signs of GI stasis. As soon as you notice any of these symptoms, you need to take your bunny to the vet. A good way to prevent wool block is to feed a lot of roughage and shear your German Angora at least every 90 days. The hay is not only a good dietary choice for its benefits to the rabbit\u2019s digestive system. Rabbit\u2019s teeth grow throughout their lifetime, and chewing on hay helps grind them down.  It\u2019s a win-win choice! Unless you\u2019re planning on breeding your rabbits, getting them spayed or neutered is a choice worth considering. This routine procedure can have tremendous benefits on your rabbit\u2019s health and personality (although the German Angora already has a lovely temperament!). Spaying or neutering your rabbit will minimize the risk of cancer and diseases that affect reproductive organs and eliminate their instinct to mark the territory with urine. The German Angora Rabbit doesn\u2019t shed and has a mat-free coat. As a breed that depends on humans to survive, the German Angora is a friendly, docile rabbit. If socialized properly from young age, these rabbits make excellent pets. Because of their fluffy fur, they are accustomed to grooming and human touch, so they don\u2019t mind being petted and enjoy spending time with their owners. They are also very intelligent and love to play. With a little effort and patience, you can even train your German Angora Rabbit to come when called and use the litter box. They are not too active and energetic, and they\u2019ll be content with napping in their comfy enclosure until the playtime comes. Since the German Angora Rabbit doesn\u2019t shed and has a generally sociable temperament, it is a good choice for families with kids. They are not prone to biting or scratching, love cuddles and there is no risk of young children ingesting hair, like there is with shedding long-haired breeds. Of course, before you decide on a pet rabbit for your family, make sure to explain to your children how to properly play and cuddle with German Angora without hurting them.", "facts": " Cylindrical Indoor/Outdoor, Good with Older Children, Good With Young Children, House Rabbits, Rabbits for Single, Rabbit for Seniors, First-time Owners Docile, Friendly, Affectionate", "tags": "family-friendly rabbit breeds, German Angora Rabbit, low maintenance rabbit, sweet rabbit, wool rabbit breeds, wool rabbits, "}, "german lop": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/german-lop/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/german-lop.jpg", "name": "German Lop", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Not surprisingly, the German Lop originated in Germany, when breeders wanted to develop a medium-sized lop (in comparison to the 10 lb French Lop and the 4 lb Holland Lop). French Lops and Netherland Dwarfs were bred together in order to create the German Lop and other breeds were introduced at a later stage, giving the rabbit its distinctive \u201cRoman\u201d nose. In 1960, this rabbit breed was shown in Saarbrucken, West Germany and was officially recognized in 1970 under the name \u201cDeutsche Klein Widder.\u201d It was imported into Holland in 1972 and standardized in the Netherlands in 1976 and in Switzerland in 1984. The breed was also recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRA) in 1990 and today, it is the third most popular lop behind the Miniature and Dwarf Lop. A German Lop has a 12-year lifespan, so owning this pet is definitely a commitment. The German Lop is a hearty rabbit, ideally weighing between 6-8 lbs once it is fully grown. It is muscular all around, especially in the rump area, which should also be short and well-rounded. Its large ears are thick and hang straight down just behind its eyes, measuring anywhere from 11-14 inches. Like other lops, the German lop has normal-length, dense hair fibers and strong guard hairs. Despite this, its coat does not require much care to keep it in tip-top shape. Simply run damp hands over the coat every other week or use a slicker brush to get rid of any stray hairs. There are many combinations accepted by the British Rabbit Council, including Agouti (chinchilla, chestnut agouti, opal), Broken (white with colored spots and/or pattern, tricolors included), Ticked (gold tipped or silver-tipped black, blue, chocolate, silver fox, lilac steel, sable, smoke pearl steel), Shaded (sable, smoke/frosted pearl, tortoise, sable point), Wide band (cream, fawn, red and orange) and Self ( REW [ruby-eyed-white], BEW [blue-eyed-white] chocolate, lilac, black, blue). German Lops are muscular all around, especially in the rump area, which should also be short and well-rounded. A German Lop\u2019s diet does not differ from any other rabbit breed. It should be 70 percent hay (there are several types of hay/rabbit-friendly grass available on the market), with the remaining 30 percent being a healthy mix of pellets, fruits, vegetables, and leafy greens. Research what kind of fruits, vegetables, and greens are rabbit-friendly. Whether indoors or out, the German Lop enclosure needs to have adequate space for it to stretch comfortably and relax, with plenty of space to move about. Outdoor enclosures need to have protection from the elements, such as cold, sun, rain, heat, etc. Always be aware of temperature changes and local predators. Outdoor enclosures should be raised from the ground and should have a ramp that leads to the ground \u201cfloor\u201d so the rabbit can roam about. Indoor enclosures need just as much space, but can be made of wire, as long as it has a solid bottom. The bottom should be laid with hay, spot-cleaned everyday and completely replaced every 6-8 days. If your German Lop is a pet and spends more of its time indoors, make sure to take it out as soon as you get home so it can have some time exploring its surroundings in a bunny-safe room. This rabbit breed does not have any particular disease or health issues, however it does tend to suffer from sore hocks if kept in an enclosure with a wire bottom (not recommended for any rabbit). Should you keep your rabbit mostly outdoors, be aware of flystrike, especially in hotter months. This occurs when flies lay its eggs in soiled parts of your rabbit\u2019s fur (mostly near their bottoms) and once the eggs hatch, feed on the rabbit. This is painful for your rabbit and can even be lethal \u2013 be sure to take your rabbit to your vet to get it treated as soon as you notice it. Check your rabbit\u2019s mouth every two weeks for overgrown teeth, as rabbit\u2019s teeth never stop growing. If your German Lop\u2019s diet is low in hay, teeth can continue to grow into its face and jaw. Veterinarians can usually treat any infection due to overgrown teeth and shave teeth down to a manageable length. Finally, every rabbit should be periodically checked for ear mites, as it is a common problem with rabbits that are mostly kept outdoors. German Lop bucks can be neutered as young as three and a half months old, while does can be spayed at four months old; some veterinarians tend to wait until the doe is older, as it poses less of a risk. A German Lop\u2019s large ears are thick and hang straight down just behind its eyes, measuring 11-14 inches. German Lops have a longer lifespan than most rabbits, living as long as 12 years (the average rabbit lifespan is between 6-8 years). This long life means owning a German Lop as a pet or show animal is definitely a commitment. Having said that, its docile, affectionate nature makes it an excellent pet for seniors, singles, couples and families. In order to be properly socialized, German Lops need to spend a minimum of approximately four hours a day out of its enclosure. Allow it to explore its environments (both inside and out, if possible) and also encourage interaction with other people, whether it be strangers or children. With lots of time, patience and rewards, rabbits can be potty trained but it takes much longer than other pets. Instead of using just one litter box, try to spread a couple around the house so they won\u2019t be tempted to do it in a corner.", "facts": " Commercial Singles, Seniors, House/ Apartment Rabbits, children, First-time owners, Outdoor/Indoor Rabbits Affectionate, calm, docile", "tags": "docile rabbit breeds, german lop, german lop rabbit, lop rabbit, rabbits fo seniors, rabbits for families, "}, "giant angora rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/giant-angora-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giant-angora-668x501.jpg", "name": "Giant Angora Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "For many years, the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) only recognized two types of Angoras \u2013 the French and the English \u2013 because the other types were not different enough to be considered a separate breed. Louise Walsh of Tauton Massachusetts set her sights on creating a larger breed of Angora that was different from the others. Walsh crossed German Angoras to larger commercial breeds and developed an all-white rabbit that had some ear and head furnishings with exceptional high-quality wool. In 1988, the Giant Angora Rabbit was accepted by the ARBA. Due to its large size, the Giant Angora rabbit requires a large enclosure to ensure a comfortable life. Giant Angoras have a commercial body type and a large oval head that is broad on the forehead and slightly narrower at the muzzle. They have facial forehead tufts as well as cheek furnishings. The ears are lightly fringed and well tasseled. Out of the four Angora breeds recognized by the ARBA, the Giant Angora rabbit produces the most wool. They have three different kinds of fiber in its wool: soft underwool (gentle waves and shine), awn fluff (crimped with a hooked end) and awn hair (guard hairs which are strong and straight). In order to keep their wool mat-free, be sure to brush it with a bristled brush once every two days or as necessary. If your Giant Angora\u2019s wool gets a little dirty, spot-clean it with a damp towel. Despite being a descendant of the German Angoras, which do not molt, Giant Angoras go through a partial molt. However, their wool needs to be harvested 3-4 times a year by owners using shears or scissors and can produce 1-2 lbs of wool per year. Giant Angora wool is perfect to be dyed and made into clothes such as socks and mittens. Like other Angoras, the Giant Angora rabbit comes in a variety of hues from grey to brown to black, and broken colors. However, the only color that is accepted by the ARBA is REW (ruby-eyed white rabbits), also called albino rabbits. Giant Angora rabbits should always have a few toys to keep them entertained. Due to its large size, this rabbit requires an equally large enclosure to ensure a lengthy, comfortable life. Should your Giant Angora rabbit be an outdoor rabbit, wood enclosures that are raised from the ground and have a fenced bottom with a ramp are preferred to keep them safe from the elements as well as predators. Indoor enclosures should have a wire frame and a plastic bottom where pet owners can place bedding. Some rabbit cages also have wire bottoms, however the wire is harsh on your rabbit\u2019s feet. Be sure to spot-clean the bedding every day to give your rabbit a dung-free area to sleep and change the bedding every week. A Giant Angora\u2019s rabbit should consist of 70 percent hay \u2013 there are many different kinds of hay available on the market for rabbits, differing in price point and nutritional value. The rest of their diet should be a balance of leafy greens, pellets, fruits and vegetables. Be wary of what kind of fruits or vegetables you have in your home, as some of them are not recommended to be given to your bunny. Some rabbit-safe vegetables include fennel, pumpkin, asparagus, cauliflower, cucumber, and watercress. Giant Angoras are mostly used as fiber animals, meaning they are generally bred to produce wool. However, should you decide to keep this rabbit breed as a pet, be sure to socialize them when they are kits in order to have a well-rounded bunny that does well with smaller children and perhaps even other animals. The most worrisome health issue a Giant Angora rabbit has to worry about is the possibility of developing wool block.  Rabbits are clean creatures and like other animals, enjoy grooming themselves to keep their coat in good condition. Some animals, like cats, regurgitate the fur that they accidentally swallow \u2013 rabbits don\u2019t have that ability. Instead, due to a diet that is poor in hay, the wool get stuck in their stomachs and creates sort of a hairball. The rabbit believes their bellies are full and refuses to eat and eventually dies of starvation. Symptoms of wool block include lack of appetite, less droppings and a less active rabbit overall. Should you suspect your rabbit is experiencing wool block, be sure to rush them to your local veterinarian to get the problem sorted. All rabbits are also susceptible to developing overgrown teeth. This problem is also caused to a diet that lacks a proper balance of hay, which is used to slowly grind down their teeth naturally. Overgrown teeth can grow into a rabbit\u2019s jaw and face and be very painful. In order to prevent this, make sure to check your rabbit\u2019s mouth every once in a while to check for overgrown teeth and always make sure they have a proper diet consisting of mostly hay. Giant Angora wool is perfect to be dyed and made into clothes such as socks and mittens. Giant Angoras should have as much time outside of their enclosures as possible in order for their individual personalities to really shine. Rabbits who are mostly kept in their enclosures and away from human activity do not have the time to interact with their humans and won\u2019t be able to create a lasting relationship. Whether you decide to keep your Angora indoors or out, make sure they have plenty of room to roam around freely and safely. Indoor rabbits should have the freedom to hop around your rooms and have access to sunlight, while outdoor rabbits should be out of their enclosures a few hours every day to stretch their legs in a fenced yard. Because they are so large, we do not recommend this kind of breed to those living in apartments. Couples or families who are able to care for a larger rabbit should have a fenced yard and should also teach their children how to handle large animals without hurting themselves or the bunny. Rabbits should also have a few toys to keep them entertained. Rabbits are not easy animals to litter train, however it is possible with lots of patience and rewards when they do the deed in the correct spot. Many owners find having several litter boxes spread across the home is a necessary evil in order for their indoor rabbit not to leave their droppings all over their home. They also find that if their rabbit is prone to doing the deed in one particular corner, they place a litter box in that corner so the rabbit can make the connection and understand that they should be doing their business in the box and not outside the box wherever they please.", "facts": " Commercial Experienced owners, House rabbits, Families with older children, Indoor rabbits, outdoor rabbits Shy, gentle, docile", "tags": "awn fluff, awn hair, docile rabbits, gentle rabbits, giant angora, giant rabbit, soft underwool, Wool Block, wool rabbits, "}, "giant chinchilla rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/giant-chinchilla-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/giant-chinchilla-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Giant Chinchilla Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Chinchilla Rabbit arrived in the United States in 1919 and became an instant hit thanks to its gorgeous coat. However, breeders worked to develop a larger breed of Chinchilla, since the Standard weighed only 5-7 lbs. The American Chinchilla was developed in 1924, but a breeder by the name of Mr. Edward H. Stahl had plans to produce a larger version. He developed the Giant Chinchilla, which was created by crossing New Zealand White does, Standard Chinchilla bucks and American Blue rabbits. The Giant Chinchilla Rabbit was accepted into the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) in 1928. The Giant Chinchilla Rabbit is the only rabbit of the Chinchilla family with a flyback coat. The Giant Chinchilla Rabbit should weigh between 12 and 15 lbs., with females usually weighing a pound or two more than bucks. They have a semi-arched body shape with powerful legs and feet, and a soft white underbelly. Its medium-length ears should also be straight and erect. The Giant Chinchilla is the only rabbit of the Chinchilla family with a flyback coat, but the maintenance to keep them in tip-top shape does not differ from that of other rabbits with coats that have similar length fur. Owners will notice an increased amount of shedding two times a year. If you keep a Giant Chinchilla as a pet, it would be wise to brush them twice a week during these heavy molt periods outside with a slicker brush. Otherwise, grooming should be performed once biweekly. Like the American Chinchilla, there is only one color accepted by the ARBA. The under color is dark slate blue at the base and the top edge a darker blue with a portion of light grey in between. The slight eye circles are a light pearl color and well defined. The underside of the tail is white while the topside is mostly black with a few white hairs. Eye colors can be brown, blue-grey or marbled, however dark brown is preferred. The Giant Chinchilla Rabbit is known to be an easy-going pet who enjoys a laid-back lifestyle. Due to this rabbit\u2019s size, the Giant Chinchilla Rabbit needs a large enclosure to keep it comfortable. It needs to be at least 3 ft x 3 ft x 4 ft. \u2013 make sure that your rabbit can easily stretch out at the bottom of its cage. Enclosures should be made of wire and have a solid bottom (such as plastic or metal), as sores easily develop when rabbits lay on a wire-bottom cage for too long. The bottom should also be lined with hay (horse hay is acceptable), and need to be spot-cleaned for faeces every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. These rabbits do well either indoors or outdoors, but be sure that outdoor enclosures are covered from the elements (sun and rain), but also provide enough draft to keep them cool during warmer temperatures. When temperatures raise or drop too much, bring them indoors. Pet rabbits follow the same diet as rabbits who are bred for meat, fur and show purposes. Its diet should consist mainly of hay (70 percent), while the rest should be a healthy balance of pellets, leafy greens, fruits and vegetables. Be sure to research what kind of fruits, vegetables, and greens that are rabbit-friendly. Limit the amount of fruits that are high in sugar  (apples, for instance, are a good fruit as it does not contain high levels of sugar). Make sure to stay clear of iceberg lettuce, as it contains too much water and too little fiber to count as a good meal. Also do not feed your rabbit yard clippings as grass is usually treated with fertilizer, insecticides, pesticides, and other chemicals that can harm your rabbit. When it comes to allowing your Giant Chinchilla Rabbit to play, indoor rooms need to be rabbit-safe, which means it needs to be free of things that can hurt them (such as wires). In order for your rabbit to play safely outside, always be vigilant in case a predator approaches (such as a racoon) and make sure they do not eat anything that can hurt them. Giant Chinchillas are not particularly susceptible to any specific hereditary disease, however there are many common problems that can occur if one does not take proper care of them. Cages should always be made of galvanized steel and should have a separate part where droppings will not get caught in their fur. This causes flystrike, an extremely painful condition that can result in death.. Be sure to check your rabbit\u2019s ears for signs of ear mites  and check your rabbit\u2019s mouth at least once every other week to make sure their teeth are an appropriate size. A diet high in hay will make sure that its teeth are properly shaven down (hay does this naturally), but if you find your rabbit\u2019s teeth are still growing out of control, a rabbit-safe block of wood it can chew on is sufficient to keep them at a reasonable length. The American Chinchilla\u2019s sweet nature and even temper makes it a wonderful pet for singles, couples and seniors. The Giant Chinchilla Rabbit is known to be an easy-going pet who enjoys stretching out around in your home, contently just watching its human family go about their daily lives. The American Chinchilla\u2019s overall sweet nature and even temper makes it a wonderful pet for singles, couples and seniors. As long as it is exposed to children when it is a kit, your rabbit will enjoy the presence of children. While this breed is not overly excitable or energetic, it is wise to give your rabbit a few toys to play with whether they are inside or outside of their cage. Every rabbit is different and you\u2019ll learn what your rabbit enjoys playing with by using the trial and error method. When it comes to potty-training your rabbit, you may find it is significantly more difficult than training another pet such as a cat or dog. While more challenging, it is definitely not impossible to litter-train rabbits but they do require more patience and time than other animals. Many owners have found that placing several litter boxes around the house works best, as your rabbit won\u2019t have to travel to the other side of your house to uses its bathroom.", "facts": " Semi-Arch Rabbits for Singles, rabbits for seniors, indoor/outdoor rabbits, house rabbits, families with older children, first-time owners Playful, docile, calm, gentle", "tags": "chinchilla rabbit, giant chinchilla, giant rabbit breeds, rabbits for older kids, rabbits for seniors, "}, "gotland rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/gotland-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gotland-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Gotland Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Gotland Rabbit, which related to the rare Mellerud Rabbit, is an indigenous breed from Sweden that is now endangered and, therefore, rare. Unlike so many other pet rabbit breeds, Gotlands were not developed as part of a breeding program. Instead, they developed naturally in the wild over the course of centuries. However, modern breeding programs have been established in order to keep the Gotland Rabbit from going extinct. Since the 1500s, rabbits had been kept on farms in Sweden, mostly for the use of their pelts and meat. Over time, show breeds became more popular and farm rabbits started becoming more rare, but some were discovered on Gotland Island in the 1970s, and today\u2019s Gotlands originated from those rabbits. Today, the Gotland Rabbit Society is in charge of preserving this breed. Only those animals born from parents registered by the Society are considered purebred and can be registered and maintained in the official gene bank registry. Gotland Rabbits are inquisitive and energetic. The body of a Gotland Rabbit will depend upon the gender of the animal. While a doe will be elongated and feature a fine head, a buck will appear more compact and have a thicker muzzle and rounder head. However, the weight will be within the same range for both genders. The ears should be relatively thin, as well as medium in length, and they should be pointed instead of rounded. The eyes will appear alert, and they will be a bit large in size. A Gotland Rabbit\u2019s lovely coat will be fine and short. Even though it will typically be straight, there have been a few Gotlands that have featured the Rex fur type. All eye colors are allowed, and all fur colors and patterns are also allowed within the Gotland Rabbit breed. The Gotland Rabbit is an indigenous and rare breed from Sweden. Feeding your Gotland Rabbit a natural diet will help ensure his long-term health and happiness. Search for a high quality hay, as well as non-toxic plants and fresh grasses that have been grown organically. You can also feed your pet pellets that are specifically designed for rabbits, but only provide them as an occasional treat and in small amounts because they might have too many calories for landrace breeds like the Gotland. On top of that, you can provide your pet with fresh foods that include dark, leafy greens and vegetables, as well as some starchy vegetables and fruits as treats. And, as with any other pet rabbit, you should always provide him with fresh, clean water. In terms of enclosure, you want your rabbit\u2019s cage to be large and comfortable. Your pet should be able to move around, stand up tall, and stretch easily while in his cage, but your Gotland Rabbit will greatly benefit from time spent exercising and interacting with you outside of his cage as well. If you wish to keep your Gotland outside, you can do so if you provide your pet with protection against harsh sunlight, predators, and drafts. Overall, this breed is adapted to living outside all year, and these animals are generally hardy. Because of its history, the Gotland Rabbit has been able to retain genetic diversity, and it has also been able to maintain good health, so there are few genetic illnesses that are associated with this breed. Overall, this breed is considered hardy, as it is rarely afflicted with genetic defects or diseases. The key is to prevent your pet from becoming stressed, and to keep him away from sudden temperature changes and drafts that could reduce his body\u2019s ability to fight off infections. Gotland Rabbits will benefit from time spent exercising and interacting with you. Gotland Rabbits are known for having a great temperament, making them wonderful pets. They can be described as being friendly and lively, and they enjoy exploring their environment.

The original name for the Harlequin rabbit was the Japanese rabbit, however that was dropped during the World Wars. The Harlequin Rabbit breed is often called the clown of rabbits due to their unique colors and markings. This rabbit has a commercial body type, usually weighs anywhere from 6.5 lbs to 9.5 lbs and has a rather broad head compared to other rabbits. Harlequin rabbits have short, sort rabbit fur that doesn\u2019t need much maintenance to keep clean. Shedding is minimal, but if you\u2019re worried about the amount of fur that may find itself on your clothes and furniture, simply brush them with a wire bristled brush once a week or as necessary. Indoor rabbits will usually have a cleaner coat than outdoor rabbits, so if your rabbit has some dirt on him, be sure to spot-clean it with a damp towel. Under no circumstances should you give your rabbit a bath, as this causes them great stress and may give them a heart attack which can result in death. The Harlequin rabbit breed is often called the clown of rabbits due to their unique colors and markings. There are actually two kinds of Harlequin rabbits: the Magpie and the Japanese. Japanese Harlequin rabbits are usually orange and combined with either lilac, chocolate, black or blue. Magpie Harlequin rabbits are usually white combined with either blue, black, chocolate or lilac. Their body markings are either bands, bars or a combination of the two. In order to qualify for the American Rabbit Breeders Association\u2019s Standard of Perfection, Harlequin rabbits need to have 3 part frontal alteration. This means the ears must be different colors, the face must also be different colors and they must alternate with the ears. The chest and hind feet should also be two different colors. Harlequin rabbits are outgoing creatures who love to hop around and explore every inch of their rooms. Rabbits need an adequate enclosure to  spend some of their time to eat, sleep, etc. Should you have an outdoor enclosure, it should be raised and have enough space for the rabbit to stretch their legs out comfortably. It should also have a ramp that lowers to the bottom of their fenced enclosure so they can feel some grass and ground beneath their feet. Indoor rabbits should have a wire enclosure that also allows them enough space to stretch out. Their bedding should be spot-cleaned every day so they can lay down on clean, soft bedding and it should be completely replaced every week. A Harlequin rabbit\u2019s diet is like any other pet rabbit in that it should consist mostly of hay \u2013 70 percent. The rest of their diet should be a healthy mix of pellets, vegetables and fruits. Before feeding any new fruit and vegetable to your rabbit, make sure it does not cause any harm to your bunny by researching it first. If you\u2019re unsure, the easiest thing is not to feed it to them. Some surprising foods that are actually dangerous to rabbits include onions, leeks, chives and mustard greens. Contrary to popular belief, you should not feed your rabbit most lettuces, as they contain lactucarium, which will give your rabbit diarrhea. There are plenty of other leafy greens and vegetables that you can feed your rabbit such as parsnips, watercress, Brussels sprouts and fennel. Harlequin rabbits are active, happy-go-lucky creatures who need plenty of outdoor time in order to bond with their human family. While you\u2019re at work, it\u2019s best to keep them in their enclosure where they are safe from harm but while you\u2019re home making dinner or doing other chores, make sure to let your bunny roam free around the house so they can get their much-needed exercise, plus interact with their pet parents. The Harlequin rabbit does not have any known breed-specific health problems, however they are susceptible to other common rabbit problems, including overgrown teeth. Unlike humans, rabbit teeth continue to grow well into their adulthood \u2013 in fact, they never stop growing! Should your pet rabbit have a diet that lacks in hay, they will not be able to naturally shave their down their teeth. Their teeth could grow much more than they are supposed to and grow into their jaws and mouths and be very painful. Always monitor your rabbit\u2019s teeth by taking a peek in their mouth every week or so to make sure they are being kept nice and short. As with any rabbits, it is also important to keep their nails nice and short so they don\u2019t accidentally hurt themselves or other people while they are on laps. Either take your rabbit to your local veterinarian to do this or you can do it yourself by using a pair of sharp nail clippers. If you\u2019re doing it yourself, be aware of where your rabbit\u2019s nail quick is and don\u2019t cut their nails too short. Harlequin rabbits do not have any known breed-specific health problems. Rabbits are much harder to litter train than other animals such as cats, dogs and birds however it is possible with lots of patience, perseverance and plenty of treats. Many rabbit parents will have 5 or 6 litter scattered across their home so their pet rabbit can easily access the litter box instead of doing the deed wherever they please. Having said that, don\u2019t be alarmed if potty training your rabbit takes a few months\u2026 it may be a lengthy process, but it\u2019s well worth the end result. The Harlequin rabbit is an outgoing creature who loves to hop around and explore every inch of his rooms, even if they\u2019ve done it dozens of times before. They are truly the clowns of the rabbit world, both with their colorful bodies and personalities. They are good-natured bunnies who will appreciate the occasional pat on the head and back scratch. Although this is not a mini or small-sized rabbit, they still do well with children, so long as younger ones are supervised while they play with your harlequin. They will no doubt be enticed by their gorgeous coat and even more excited when they realize how energetic they are. Be sure to provide your rabbit with a few bunny-safe toys. Rabbits have different personalities and can be picky with their toys. You could decide to spend a good hundred dollars on a fantastic bunny-safe toy and find out your rabbit couldn\u2019t care less about it.

The Havana rabbit actually got its start in Holland when a rich brown rabbit was born in the litter of a Dutch doe in the late 1800\u2019s. The rabbit\u2019s gorgeous deep coloration inspired breeders to develop it into a new breed. The name \u201cHavana\u201d rabbit is because it resembles the chocolate color from Cuban cigars from the city of Havana. In 1916, the Havana rabbit was brought to the United States and shortly after, was accepted into the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA). The blue Havana rabbit was recognized by the ARBA in 1965 and the black Havana rabbit in 1980. Most recently, color specifications for the broken-colored Havana Rabbit line was made in 2008. The Havana Rabbit earned its name because its chocolate fur is the same color as Cuban cigars. The Havana rabbit is a compact breed that should not exceed 6.5 lbs. They have short, rounded bodies. The top line should form a half-circle  that rises over the hips before or down to the tail. They have short, straight legs with dark-colored toenails, short ears which are relatively close together, medium-sized eyes and a short head with full cheeks. This breed of rabbit has short, soft, flyback fur that does not much need maintenance to keep in tip-top condition. To keep their shedding to a minimum, indoor rabbits can be groomed once a week with a slick brush and when shedding time comes around (around Spring), increasing their brushings to twice a week. The Havana rabbit is recognized in four color types by the ARBA: chocolate, blue, black, and broken, which is best described as a mix of colors that looks like a Dalmatian.  The Havana rabbit comes in 4 colors: chocolate, blue, black, and broken. Like any other breed of rabbit, Havana bunnies require a diet consisting of at least 70 percent hay. The rest of their diet is made up a healthy balance of pellets, leafy greens, fruits and vegetables. Be aware of what kind of leafy greens you feed your rabbit, as some of them (like iceberg lettuce) contain no great amount of vitamins or nutrients and contain landanum, which can be harmful in large quantities. Also be careful of what kind of vegetables you decide to feed your rabbit, as some of them are harmful (such as beans, cabbage, potatoes, etc), and some fruits contain too much sugar. Havana rabbits do well whether they are indoors or outdoors, provided they are given plenty of time out of their enclosures to stretch their legs and catch some much-needed sunshine. Outdoor enclosures should be made of wood or wire and need to be raised off the ground in order to provide protection from wildlife. Indoor rabbit enclosures should be made of wire and have bedding that should be spot-cleaned every day for cleanliness and completely changed out at the end of every week. The Havana rabbit is not known to be susceptible to any particular health issues, but like any other rabbit, measures must be taken in order to raise a healthy, happy rabbit.  Remember to check their mouths once every week or two for ingrown teeth, which can grow into their jaw and faces and cause a lot of pain. The best way to prevent overgrown teeth is to have a proper diet with 70 percent hay, as the hay will naturally file down their teeth. Should you rabbit live outdoors, be aware that they will be more susceptible to flystrike. Flystrike is an extremely painful condition in which flies lay their eggs in a rabbit\u2019s fur near dirty areas. When the eggs hatch, they begin sustaining themselves by way of eating your rabbit from the inside out. In order to avoid flystrike, always check your rabbit for dirt or feces stuck on their coat. Always make sure your rabbit\u2019s enclosure and coat is clean and that your rabbit\u2019s eating habits remain constant. Should you decide to spay or neuter your rabbit, some owners notice that their rabbit tends to be less aggressive. However the Havana rabbit is not known to be hostile, so neutering them may do nothing to their personality. Does can be spayed once they are 4-6 months old while bucks can be neutered as young as 3 and a half months old. Havana rabbits are great show and pet bunnies who enjoy being free to roam indoors. Rabbits are sweet creatures who easily bond with their human family so long as they are given time and space to properly socialize on their own terms. Havana rabbits are great show and pet bunnies who enjoy being free to roam indoors, or outdoors in a fenced yard. While not the most energetic rabbit breed by any means, these medium-sized rabbits are perfectly capable of running around indoors or out and letting out a little mid-air hop. Should you decide to engage in some one-on-one playtime, you may find that your particular rabbit enjoys some ear or head scratches and some gentle back petting. Because of its medium size, the Havana rabbit makes a great pet for families with children of any age. Because it isn\u2019t too high energy, it makes an attractive pet for seniors looking for a fuzzy companion in their lives. Some rabbits need to be entertained with many toys (whether it is a store-bought one or something as simple as a toilet paper roll is entirely up to you), others don\u2019t need much to keep them happy. It all depends on your particular rabbit\u2019s personality, which each pet parent needs to discover with lots of playtime outside of their enclosures. When it comes to potty-training your rabbit, you may find it is significantly more difficult than training another pet such as a cat or dog. While more challenging, it is definitely not impossible to litter-train rabbits but they do require much more patience and time than other animals. Many pet parents have found that placing several litter boxes around the house works best, as your rabbit won\u2019t have to travel to the other side of your house to do the deed and risk not making it.", "facts": " Compact Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors, Apartment Rabbits, House Rabbits, Families with children, First-time owners, Indoor/Outdoor rabbits Calm, playful, affectionate, sweet", "tags": "broken color, family rabbits, flyback fur, gentle rabbit breeds, havana rabbit, ingrown teeth, rabbits for singles, "}, "himalayan rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/himalayan-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/himalayan-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Himalayan Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Himalayan rabbit is one of the oldest rabbit breeds, so much so that its origin has practically been lost in history. Some say it did indeed originate somewhere in the Himalayan mountain area, however others describe it being seen in other areas of the world. These rabbits made their first appearance in America around the early 1900s and were one of the earliest breeds to be recognized by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA). The Himalayan rabbit is gentle and patient, making them the perfect pet for families with young children or seniors. The Himalayan breed is the only kind of rabbit known to have a cylindrical body shape. When looking at this rabbit from an aerial point of view, the sides should be straight from its shoulders to the hind legs with little or no taper. Even when these rabbits are stretched out as far as they can, their feet will remain flat on the surface, which makes them truly unique. A Himalayan rabbit\u2019s flyback fur is short, soft and doesn\u2019t need much maintenance in order to keep its healthy sheen. Should you find your Himalayan rabbit is shedding more than usual (such as during spring), simply brush their fur 2-3 times per week or as required. Otherwise, a weekly brushing with spot-cleaning using a damp cloth should more than sufficient. The Himalayan rabbit\u2019s body is always white with different colored markings. The markings include colored \u201cboots\u201d, an egg-shaped marking on its nose and a colored tail and ears. The markings can be black, blue, chocolate or lilac. This coloration is due to a heat-sensitive enzyme on the Himalayan\u2019s body that creates a brown pigment melanin. This enzyme is active on the parts of the body where the Himalayan rabbit is discolored, such as their ears, nose, feet and tail. Anything from a rabbit-safe block of wood to a pet-store purchased toy should do fine to ease the Himalayan rabbit\u2019s boredom. Himalayan kits (which is short for kittens, also known as baby rabbits) are particularly sensitive to cold, so be sure to bring them indoors if the weather is a little on the chilly side. Should older Himalayan rabbits be exposed to cold temperatures,  their white fur could darken, but otherwise, they should do well so long as the temperature does not drop below the freezing mark. Outdoor enclosures should be made of wire or wood and should be raised in order to protect your rabbit from the elements and predators such as coyotes and raccoons. Indoor enclosures should be made of wire with a plastic bottom so bedding can be placed for comfort. Bedding should be spot-cleaned every day to rid of it feces, and completely changed every week. Some pet parents opt for buying a completely wire cage, however this is uncomfortable for your rabbit\u2019s feet and can cause issues in the long run. Make sure their enclosure is large enough so they can comfortably stretch out of their full size and although Himalayans are relatively small, they are long so make sure you purchase the correct enclosure size. Like other rabbits, the Himalayan will benefit from a diet that consists 70 percent of high-quality hay and the rest of a healthy mix of fruits, vegetables, leafy greens and pellets. There are plenty types of pellets and hay available on the market, some with higher protein content than the other depending on your budget.  Be aware of what kid of fruits, leafy greens and vegetables you have in your home as some are rabbit-safe and others are not. In fact, most leafy greens are unsafe as they can cause digestive issues, especially if you feed your rabbit a large amount of it. Feed your rabbit greens that are high in fiber and nutrients, such as romaine lettuce, and be aware of what kind of fruits you\u2019re feeding (nothing that is too high in sugar). Unlike some rabbit breeds (such as the Angora), the Himalayan rabbit is not susceptible to any particular health issues like Wool block. They do require regular checking in a few places such as their ears (for mites), their coat and backsides (for flystrike) and their teeth (for overgrown teeth). Overgrown teeth can protrude into your rabbit\u2019s face and jaw and be painful. Symptoms include a loss of appetite, droppings and overall less movement from your rabbit. A diet that is high in hay (70 percent is ideal) should be enough to prevent this painful condition, as hay naturally files down a rabbit\u2019s ever-growing teeth and ensure that they do not overgrow. When a rabbit\u2019s coat is soiled with feces, urine or other unpleasantness, flies may like to call your rabbit\u2019s bottom their home. They can lay their eggs and once the eggs have hatched, they will eat your rabbit\u2019s flesh while they are alive in order to get the nutrients to grow. This is excruciating for your rabbit and can cause death. If you believe your rabbit may have contracted flystrike, take them to your local veterinarian immediately for treatment. This rabbit\u2019s small size makes it ideal for smaller hands to carefully pick up. This rabbit\u2019s small size makes it ideal for smaller hands to carefully pick up. In fact, this breed of rabbit is not known to scratch or bite humans, making them the perfect pet for families with young children or seniors looking for a furry companion to add some color to their life. They are generally calm-natured animals who don\u2019t mind being picked up, petted and handled and unlike other high-energy rabbits, Himalayans are not particularly active. Having said that, they do require plenty of time out of their enclosures not only to socialize and bond with their human family but also to stretch their legs and catch some sunshine. Should you live in an apartment, pull back the drapes so your Himalayan can enjoy some much-needed Vitamin D and if you have a yard, make sure it is fenced so your rabbit won\u2019t escape. These rabbits also wouldn\u2019t mind having some toys to play with and chew up (not unlike other dogs like dogs and birds!). Anything from a rabbit-safe block of wood to a pet-store purchased toy should do fine to ease their boredom. Rabbits are not impossible to litter train, however they are significantly more challenging than training, let\u2019s say, a dog or a cat. They have the tendency to \u201cgo\u201d anywhere they please because in their mind, your living room court very well be their courtyard. To remedy this requires plenty of patience\u2026and lots of litter boxes. Place a few litter boxes around your home where you find your Himalayan tends to do the deed and with lots of hard work (and rewards!), you should be well on your way to litter-training your little rabbit.", "facts": " Cylindrical Singles, Seniors, apartment or houses, Families with children, First-time owners, Indoor or outdoor Rabbits Gentle, docile, calm", "tags": "docile rabbit breeds, himalayan rabbit, oldest rabbit breed, rabbits for familes, rabbits for seniors, "}, "holland lop": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/holland-lop/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/holland-lop.jpg", "name": "Holland Lop", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Not all rabbit breeds made it into this world naturally. Some were created with the help of careful breeders who wanted to ensure that their clients got the best bunnies that money could buy. The Holland Lop got its start in the 1950s in Netherlands. A Dutch breeder Adriann de Cock wanted to combine the qualities of a French Lop and a Netherland Dwarf Rabbit. These are two very different breeds, so it was an intriguing mix to say the least. Sadly, The resulting litter of six was unsuccessful. This was because their ears were erect and did not have the loping effect of the Holland Lop we know and love today. In 1952, de Cock took a doe from that litter of six and bred her with an English Lop buck. After a few hit and misses of breeding from these litters, de Cock successfully bred a Holland Lop with the French Lop\u2019s characteristic floppy ears. The rest, as they say, is history. This breed was recognized by Netherlands\u2019 Governing Rabbit Council in 1964 and by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association by 1976. Ever since then, the whole world has enjoyed having the incredible Holland Lop in their lives. The Holland Lop is a dwarf rabbit, which means it should weigh about 4 lbs. once fully grown. \n The Holland Lop is a dwarf rabbit, which means that it should weigh about 4 lbs. once fully grown. They have a wide, yet short body. This consequently gives these rabbits a compact body shape. They pose similarly to a cat, resting mostly on their hind legs and only slightly on their two front feet. The Holland Lop\u2019s head is broad with a distinct puff of fur at the back, that has become known as the \u201ccrown\u201d. The crown should be thick and wide and raised above the head. While their stocky body and fluffy round head would have been more than enough to make these bunnies cute, it\u2019s their floppy ears that make this breed district and endlessly lovable. Without a doubt, the Holland Lop\u2019s most famous feature is their large fur-covered ears which fall on either side of their heads. The ears are well-furred and thick and they are in the shape of a teaspoon (rounded tips and wider at the bottom). The slack ears that frame their adorable faces only add to the appeal these bunnies have for prospective owners. These rabbits were bred to be as adorable as possible, so you can expect them to worm their way into your heart at first site. The Holland Lop is one of the most popular rabbit breeds, both in the United States and around the world. And it\u2019s not merely their lovely appearance that charms people! Easy-going, sweet, and friendly, the Holland Lop will win you over with its wonderful personality. These bunnies will love you right back and bring joy to any home. That\u2019s certainly not true of any breed of rabbit and it is what has kept this particular breed so beloved for generations.  The Holland Lop\u2019s coat is of the rollback variety. It is dense and medium in length. This smooth and glossy coat does not require much grooming to keep it in good condition. So in addition to being adorable and lovable, the Holland Lop is a low-maintenance rabbit breed. No wonder children everywhere go so ga-ga for these things! As a rule of thumb, a weekly or bi-weekly grooming session should suffice. Simply brush your bunny with a slicker brush or a fur splitter (aka a wide toothed comb) to keep their coat tangle-free and lustrous. Of course, the purpose of coat grooming is not merely to maintain your rabbit\u2019s beautiful appearance. Rabbits are avid groomers, and as a result will ingest a lot of their own hair. Unfortunately, all of that fur muching might  lead to deadly intestinal blockage in your little friend. So the goal of brushing this bunny is to minimize the amount of loose hair your pet will ingest. Never forget to do this. Hair brushing is particularly important during the molting season. At the change of seasons, you may notice your rabbit will begin to shed a little more than usual. During these heavy-shedding periods, you will need to brush your bunny a few times a day. It may seem like your little bunny won\u2019t need those extra brushing sessions, but trust us, this is so important.  On the flip side, bathing is never recommended for rabbits. They aren\u2019t remotely fond of being bathed and it can cause significant stress. That\u2019s the last thing you want for your pet. If your Holland Lop gets dirty, simply use a moistened cotton ball to clean their fur. It might take longer to clean your pet this way, but will be so much better for the bunny in the long run. This breed of rabbit is recognized in a variety of colors and groups. They are divided up into two classifications: solid  (one color only) and broken (which contain patches of one or two other colors).  Some (of the many) examples include chestnut agouti, chinchilla, chocolate and opal in the \u201cAgouti\u201d group; tortoise, seal, smoke pearl and sable points in the \u201cShaded\u201d group; and cream, fawn, frosty, orange, tricolor, and red in the \u201cWide Band\u201d group. The impressive variety of coat colors within this breed only adds to the appeal and popularity of these bunnies. Cuteness is guaranteed with a Holland Lop, and in no less than 15 different colors and color combinations! The possibilities are almost endless.  The Holland Lop is recognized in a variety of colors and groups. To keep a Holland Lop happy and healthy does not require much time or effort. In comparison to a dog or cat, rabbits are much less demanding pets. Their diet and a good ratio of indoor to outdoor time are two of the most important aspects of their care. So take special care with those aspects.  The first thing you should do is provide proper rabbit housing. A Holland Lop might be a small bunny, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of room to feel happy and stay healthy in your care. The majority of bunny owners keep their pets indoors since they are family pets. That also tends to be the case with the Holland Lop. If you are the sort of rabbit owner who likes to let their bunny hop freely around your house, you will need to rabbit-proof your home. Make sure that there are no wires, chords, or other unsafe objects on the floor that your bunny could chew on. They should also have their own private litter and a cage to retreat to when they feel like it.   An indoor Holland Lop\u2019s enclosure should have sides made of strong wire to prevent them from chewing through the cage. However, they should never have a cage with a wire bottom. Cages and hutches with wire bottoms will hurt your pet\u2019s feet and lead to sore hocks. So, always make sure that they are only hopping on soft and comfy bedding instead. Pet owners will need to spot-clean the bedding every day to rid it of feces and replace the entire bedding every week. A bit of an annoyance sure, but one that will make your bunny\u2019s life so much more pleasant.  The cage should also be large enough for your rabbit to stretch out comfortably. This shouldn\u2019t be difficult since the Holland Lop is relatively small. The minimum cage size is 18 inches by 25 inches, but a bigger cage would be even better. Of course, no matter the how spacious the cage is, your pet will need a lot of out-of-cage time to exercise and be content. In addition to playtime in a rabbit-proofed space, you can always take your Holland Lop for some outdoor fun. Let them hop and play in a safely enclosed part of the garden or yard. With your supervision, of course. As for you rabbit\u2019s diet, it should consist of 70 percent high-quality hay and the rest should be a balanced mixture of fruits, vegetables, pellets, and leafy greens. You may find that your rabbit prefers one type of fruit to another (like apples, for instance). While it\u2019s great that your hopper has found a delicious fruit he loves to nibble on, perhaps you can use his love for this fruit as an advantage and use it only during training as a treats. This trick can be used for your animal in order to train them to do simple commands such as heeling or hopping or even for more complex tasks such as litter training (more on that to follow). Fortunately, the Holland Lop is not susceptible to any hereditary health issues, but taking proper care of your rabbit will make their life (and your veterinary bills) so much better in the long run. Make sure that you regularly check their mouth for overgrown teeth, which can grow into their jaws and mouths and become extremely painful. A diet high in hay will make sure this does not happen, as the hay will naturally file down your rabbit\u2019s ever-growing teeth. Spaying and neutering can be done at a young age in a rabbit\u2019s life. Your bunny does need not be older than six months before they can be safely spayed (some veterinarians will perform the procedure at four months, but most would rather wait until six months). Bucks, on the other hand, can be neutered at as young as three months old and it is commonly known that neutered bucks make for less aggressive companions (although admittedly Holland Lops are not known be aggressive at all, so neutering the buck may not do much). Holland Lops pose similarly to a cat, resting mostly on their hind legs and only slightly on their two front ones. In order to really allow your Holland Lops\u2019s personality to bloom, it is important to give them plenty of time out of their enclosures/hutches. Indoor rabbits should be let out of their cages with access to roam around at least in one particular room, if not your entire home. This will allow them to stretch out their legs, get some sunshine ,and most of all, interact with their favorite humans. These little guys make for wonderful first pets whether it is for a single person, a couple, or a family with younger or older children. The Holland Lop is a relatively active bunny and would also love to spend some time outdoors when the temperatures are just right. Fenced yards are wonderful, but if you have an open yard, investing in an exercise pen should definitely be a priority. This will give your rabbit a little bit of freedom without doesn\u2019t allowing them roam around into your neighbor\u2019s property. Bunnies might seem more manageable than dogs or cats on paper, but when they get excited they will get away from you rather quickly and get up to all sorts of mischief. You may well have a regular Bugs Bunny on your hands and need to keep that little scamp under control accordingly. In terms of toys, each rabbit has their own personality and may enjoy some toys to chew up and entertain themselves with. It may be as simple as a toilet paper roll to destroy or as elaborate as a mental pet toy from your local pet store. The only way to know for sure is to give your bunny some options and see what they prefer. You can\u2019t force a bunny to play, you can only control how they play and how much trouble they will get into. But don\u2019t let any potential trouble-making get in between you and the bunny of your dreams. The Holland Lop is a beautiful bunny and a wonderful pet suitable for any home. So if this article has piqued your interest in any way, run to your nearest pet store and see if they have a Holland Lop in stock. The pet of your dreams just might be a quick drive away.

That was where Mr. J. de Graaf created the breed when he started crossbreeding rabbits in 1977. This was done in an effort to get a blue-eyed, white rabbit. It was not until 1984 that the Hulstlander Rabbit was accepted to the Dutch National Rabbit Organization, and it was later accepted by the British Rabbit Council (BRC) in 2002 in the Rare Breeds category. The Hulstlander Rabbit features a medium length coat that\u2019s lustrous and dense. The body of the Hulstlander Rabbit will be compact and short. There will be well developed hindquarters and front legs, and the front legs will also be sturdy and short. Overall, the whole body is covered with muscles that are firm. The head should be broad, short, and strongly formed. The eyes should be lively, bright, and clear. The ears should be thick and large, and they should be held wide apart in a \u201cv\u201d shape. The ears should also be held upright, be covered well with fur, and feature rounded tips. The ear length should be anywhere from 3-4 inches. The Hulstlander Rabbit features a medium length coat that is lustrous and dense. It will also feature short guard hairs and a thick undercoat. Overall, the coat seems to have a sheen, and the surface will appear glossy and smooth. There should not be matting or molt, and there should not be any guard hairs excessively protruding from the coat. A Hulstlander Rabbit\u2019s fur will be white and free from any traces of yellow or ivory anywhere on the body. The eyes will also be a beautiful blue shade instead of pink, but the nails will be colorless. A Hulstlander Rabbit\u2019s fur will be white, and his eyes will be blue. You can house your Hulstlander Rabbit indoors, but be prepared to thoroughly rabbit-proof your home, as these curious animals enjoy exploring all of the nooks and crannies that they can find. You can also let your rabbit spend time in the great outdoors, provided that you have a safe garden area where your pet can get some fresh air and sunshine. If you are planning on housing your Hulstlander Rabbit outside, be sure to provide him with a safe and secure outdoor hutch that has plenty of room, is always kept clean, and is weatherproof. Feed your rabbit a high-fiber diet that consists of a diverse range of high quality hays, as well as pellets designed for rabbits. You should also provide your pet with a variety of fibrous vegetables. You can even feed your rabbit some fruit as a treat. Finally, always make sure that your rabbit has access to clean, fresh water. Because the Hulstlander is a hybrid rabbit breed, it is considered generally healthy. However, these rabbits can still be vulnerable to the conditions that most commonly affect all rabbits. For example, if your rabbit spends any time outside, you should treat him regularly for worms, ticks, and fleas. You can also talk to your vet about having your rabbit vaccinated against diseases like myxomatosis and VHD (Viral Haemorrhagic Disease). Also be sure to check your rabbit\u2019s teeth regularly to be certain that they are not growing too long. Providing your pet with gnaw toys designed for rabbits will help keep the teeth at an appropriate length, as will providing him with the right diet of fibrous veggies. Keep in mind, too, that overweight rabbits will find it difficult to groom themselves, and that could lead to flystrike, so feeding your pet the right diet will also ensure that he does not become overweight. Hulstlander Rabbits enjoy getting plenty of attention. Hulstlander Rabbits have been described as a friendly breed, particularly when they are able to spend a lot of time with their human family. These rabbits can be a bit cheeky, and they are inquisitive, loving, smart, and playful. They enjoy having their heads stroked, and they prefer being the center of attention. These rabbits can also be fun to watch, as they have a habit of standing up on their hind legs to look around, but they also have a tendency of falling over. When handled from a young age, they are confident and calm, and they learn quickly. They grow up to be outgoing and friendly, and they are eager to explore. Just be aware that this breed can also be a bit aggressive or territorial at times, particularly when not handled correctly or not handled often enough.

This breed was developed by crossing the French Angora rabbit with a Netherland Dwarf rabbit and the result was a small bunny with a wooly coat. This breed was recognized by the ARBA four years later in 1988 as the Jersey Wooly rabbit and is now one of the most widely-exhibited rabbits at shows in the United States, as well as a favorite pet. Jersey Woolys are also known as the \u201cNo-Kick Bunny\u201d because they are gentle, docile, and even-tempered. The Jersey Wooly rabbit has a compact body size and weighs between 1-3 lbs, making it a dwarf breed. They have small, erect ears that stand about 2-3 inches long. They have a square, bold head, which is why this breed is affectionately known as the \u201cMug Head.\u201d In order to keep the Jersey Wooly\u2019s coat clean and tangle-free, owners need to brush their rabbit\u2019s coat at least once a week during non-shedding seasons. Adult rabbits will need to be brushed a little more often once spring hits, as this time of year is commonly known as \u201cshedding season.\u201d Unlike other breeds of rabbits (like Angoras, for instance), the Jersey Wooly rabbit does not require any trimming or clipping to maintain their wool. Should your rabbit\u2019s coat get dirty, simply spot clean it with a damp cloth, as rabbits should never be given a full ear-to-tail bath (this causes them great stress and can cause cardiac problems). This rabbit breed is recognized by the ARBA in six different color groups. The Agouti group features chestnut, chinchilla, opal and squirrel colors; the Broken group features any recognized variety in conjunction with white; and the Self group consist of black, blue, chocolate, lilac, BEW (blue-eyed-white), and REW (red-eyed-white). The Shaded group features tortoise shell, blue tortoise shell, sable point, seal, Siamese sable and smoke pearl; the Tan Pattern group consists of black otter, blue otter, smoke pearl marten, sable marten, black silver marten, blue silver marten, chocolate silver marten, and lilac silver marten; and finally, the AOV (any other variety) group features pointed white black and pointed white blue variety. Because of their sweet nature, the Jersey Wooly makes a wonderful pet for most lifestyles. Due to its small size, this should be an indoor rabbit. The enclosure should be large enough to allow the Jersey Wooly rabbit to comfortably stretch it its cage (which shouldn\u2019t be very difficult since it\u2019s so small). The enclosure should be made of wire and have a plastic bottom which should be covered with bedding. The bedding should be spot-cleaned every day to clear it of debris and should be completely replaced every week. A Jersey Wool\u2019s diet is like any other rabbit\u2019s diet and should be made up of 70 percent good-quality hay (such as timothy hay). The rest of its diet should be a healthy balance of pellets, leafy greens, vegetables and fruits. Be sure to do your research and find out which foods are safe and which ones aren\u2019t for your rabbit,  as particular fruits and vegetables or parts of some fruits and vegetables (such as apple and pear seeds) are poisonous to bunnies. In order for a rabbit\u2019s personality to flourish, they need plenty of outdoor enclosure time to interact with their human handlers. This means letting your rabbit have plenty of time to hop about in a bunny-safe room (make sure there are no exposed electrical wires that can harm them) or setting them out in your fenced yard. Always be vigilant for predators (such as racoons) when your rabbit is outdoors, as they can cause serious harm to a rabbit this small. A Jersey Wooly rabbit is not as susceptible to wool block as other rabbits (English Angoras, for instance), but because of their long wool, they are still at-risk. Like cats, rabbits are clean creatures and regularly groom themselves by licking their fur. However, cats can regurgitate the wool they invest while rabbits do not have that ability. Consequently, the wool they invest builds up inside their stomachs and makes them feel full and as a result, they starve to death. Symptoms include a lack of appetite, decreased amount of droppings and less mobility in general. If you suspect your Jersey Wooly rabbit has wool block, contact your local vet immediately. Rabbits should also be de-wormed twice a year. This can be done by squeezing a pea-sized amount of de-worming paste and allowing your rabbit to eat it \u2013 this should protect them for six months. Also be sure to routinely check a rabbit\u2019s mouth for ingrown teeth which can grow into their jaws and faces and be very painful, and check they ears for signs and symptoms of ear mites. Some rabbit breeders believe that spaying/neutering your rabbit increases their life span by a few years. Does can be spayed as young as four months old while bucks can be spayed when they are as young as three and a half months of age. The Jersey Wooly\u2019s square, bold head has earned it the nickname \u201cMug Head.\u201d Jersey Woolys are also known as the \u201cNo-Kick Bunny,\u201d which means exactly what it sounds like: they are gentle, docile and not known to bite or kick their handlers due to their even tempers. Because of this, they make wonderful family pets for pet parents who have children of any age. Of course, young children should always be supervised when handling a rabbit, especially one of such a small size, but overall, they should be quiet and affectionate towards their handlers. Because of their sweet nature, they also make wonderful rabbits for first-time pet parents, seniors/retirees, couples and even singles who would like a cuddly companion to pass the time. Rabbits are harder to potty train than other animals such as dogs, birds and cats. Rabbits usually have a \u201cpotty corner\u201d in their enclosure where they usually like to do the deed. If you place a litter box in that particular corner, they will generally make the connection and slowly but surely understand that is where they are supposed to do their business. Some rabbit parents have found success by placing many litter boxes around their homes so their rabbits don\u2019t have to go to the other side of their house in order to find the right place to do the deed. These little bunnies would benefit from having a few rabbit-safe toys at their disposal. This can be as simple as an empty roll of toilet paper or a rabbit-safe wood block to as elaborate as mentally stimulating toys purchased at your local pet store. They love lots of time with their human handlers and enjoy being picked up and petted as often as you\u2019d like.", "facts": " Compact Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors, Apartment or House Rabbits, Families with children, first-time owners, Indoor rabbits Gentle, sweet, playful, docile", "tags": "dwarf rabbits, jersey wooly, Mug Head, No-Kick Bunny, rabbits for families, rabbits for seniors, Wool Block, wool rabbit breeds, "}, "lilac rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/lilac-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lilac-rabbit.jpeg", "name": "Lilac Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Lilac rabbit had its start in several places around the world at the same time. Back in the early 1900s, new breeds and colors were popping up everywhere and so, whenever a newly colored rabbit was discovered, it was made a new breed despite not having an unusual body type or fur.  The first breeder known to have exhibited Lilac rabbits  was H. Onslow of Cambridge, England, in 1913m but lilac-colored rabbits were also being produced the same year by Mabel Illingworth, who crossed Blue Imperials with Havana rabbits. In 1917, C.H. Spruty of Holland crossed Blue Beverens with Havanas to create a similar Lilac rabbit, but slightly larger. This became known as the \u201cGouda\u201d or \u201cGowenaar\u201d rabbit. The \u201cCambridge Blue\u201d was created in 1922 by R.C. Punnet (a Cambridge University professor) by using the same breeds as Spruty. The first Lilac rabbit imports were received by the U.S. and Canada circa 1926 and there was a great interest in the breed (despite never having achieved the same popularity as other breeds did). In 1940, Lilac rabbits were being shown at the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA), and by 1944, the National Lilac Rabbit Club of America was formed. The Lilac Rabbit has short fur that is soft to the touch. Lilac rabbits have a compact body type and weigh anywhere between  6-8 lbs. It has a short body with a slight rise at the top line, broad haunches, a short head, and ears that are moderately upright and short, measuring between 3.5-4 inches long. Lilac rabbits have short fur that is soft to the touch. They do not require much grooming, compared to wooly breeds such as the English Angora. Weekly brushings will keep its coat soft, but you may want to increase this amount to twice a week during molting periods, which usually occur twice a year. Like its name, the Lilac rabbit only has one ARBA-approved color \u2013 lilac/lavender. Depending on the light, the Lilac rabbit can appear more purple or more gray. ARBA standards calls for an \u201ceven pinky shade of dove color\u201d throughout the body and no other markings. Depending on the light, the Lilac rabbit can appear more purple or more gray. As a medium-sized, rabbit, Lilacs require a fairly large enclosure in order to live a lengthy, comfortable life. If it will be living outdoors, its wood enclosure needs to be raised from the ground and have a fenced bottom with a ramp, as it will keep it safe from the elements as well as predators. Indoor enclosures need to have a wire frame on the sides and a plastic bottom where bedding can be placed. Be sure to spot-clean the bedding every day and completely change the bedding every week. The Lilac rabbit\u2019s diet does not differ from any other rabbit breed \u2013 it requires a diet consisting of 70 percent good-quality hay such as orchard hay or timothy hay (alfalfa grass is also good for its overall health). The rest of the diet needs to be a balance of fruits, leafy greens, vegetables, and pellets. Like hay, there are plenty types of pellets available on the market, some with higher protein content than the others.  Be aware of what kind of fruits, leafy greens, and vegetables you include in its diet \u2013 not all are rabbit-safe. In fact, most leafy greens are unsafe as they can cause digestive issues, especially if you feed your rabbit a large amount of it. Feed your rabbit greens that are high in fiber and nutrients, such as romaine lettuce, and stay away from fruit that\u2019s high in sugar. Lilac rabbits need to spend some time out of their enclosures if owners wish to have a docile, friendly pet that is accustomed to dealing with humans of any age, as well as dogs and cats. Lilacs enjoy exploring its surroundings whether indoors or out, so always make sure indoor rooms are bunny-safe (no hazards such as exposed wires), and outdoor spaces should be fenced in to prevent running/hopping off and/or keep them safe. The best way to prevent health problems in your pet rabbit is to ensure it has a diet that is high in hay. For example, if your rabbit develops diarrhea because of a poor diet, its soiled coat can attract flies in the warmer months (especially if it is outdoors). If the rabbit is unable to groom itself properly, the flies can lay eggs in his fur (near the bottom). When those eggs hatch, they will begin to eat your rabbit \u2013 this is called flystrike. To avoid flystrike, make sure your rabbit eats a balanced diet and check their fur for any flies that may have landed on soiled fur. Other potential health problems include overgrown teeth. Your rabbit\u2019s teeth continuously grow throughout its entire life. Hay helps trim your rabbit\u2019s teeth. Overgrown teeth can grow into their mouths and jaws, causing immense pain. This can only be corrected by veterinarian who files down the teeth and prescribes antibiotics for any infection. Owners must also periodically check their Lilac\u2019s ears for any sign of ear mites. Lilac rabbits need to spend some time out of their enclosures if owners wish to have a docile, friendly pet that is accustomed to dealing with humans. Overall, Lilac rabbits are sweet, docile animals that enjoy exploring and being petted by its human family. Lilacs like to sit on your lap and be petted on its ears, head and back. Because of its friendly nature, the Lilac Rabbit does well with younger children who are gentle and understand how fragile rabbits are. This rabbit breed also makes a great companion for singles, couples or seniors. Lilacs also enjoy having toys that they can play with and chew. The most popular toys with Lilacs include cardboard boxes, plastic baby key rings, toys with bells, and stuffed animals. Your rabbit may also enjoy gnawing on a piece of rabbit-safe wood (this keeps its teeth in check as well), a ball or even an empty roll of toilet paper. Most rabbits are more difficult to train than a cat or dog, but it is not impossible. Litter training is possible with lots of patience, rewards and a few well-placed litter boxes around the house. Teaching how to make your Lilac rabbit stop, come or perform other common commands and tricks will come with time, plenty of repetition and (of course) treats.", "facts": " Compact Singles, Seniors, Apartment/House Rabbits,  Families with children, First-time owners, Outdoor/ Indoor Rabbits Docile, friendly, gentle", "tags": "docile rabbit breeds, lilac colored rabbits, lilac rabbits, rabbits for couples, rabbits for seniors, "}, "lionhead rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/lionhead-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lionhead-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Lionhead Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Who could possibly resist this fluffy ball of goofiness? A popular pet that is loving and easy to train, this rabbit breed has a lot to offer to every owner. The Lionhead rabbit\u2019s origin started in Belgium when breeders decided to mate a Swiss Fox with a Netherland Dwarf. The result was a rabbit with a genetic mutation causing wool to appear around the head and on the flanks and it became known as the \u201cmane\u201d gene. The Lionhead rabbit grew in popularity in Europe until finally, they made their way to the United States in the late \u201990s. In 2014, this breed was officially accepted into the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). Unique in looks \u2013 but also in character, the Lionhead Rabbit has a lot of traits that make it a fantastic house pet. Also, they are often seen in beauty shows and exhibitions \u2013 where their looks are prized and exemplified. Still, there is plenty you need to know before you become an owner of a Lionhead Rabbit. Here are the most important facts about the breed. The Lionhead Rabbit\u2019s mane is the result of a genetic mutation. The Lionhead rabbit has a wool mane circling around their head much like a lion\u2019s mane, hence their name. They have a high head mount, a compact body which should not exceed 3 1/2 lbs. and ears between 2-3 inches in length. Contrary to their compact body, the head of a Lionhead Rabbit can be disproportionately larger, with a well developed muzzle. It is accentuated by the mane, and as such it is the most prominent feature of the breed. The legs are usually proportional and of medium size. The ears of this breed can be quite distinct too \u2013 instead of the usual round tip and great size, the ears of the Lionhead are slightly pointed at the top and won\u2019t exceed a length of 3 inches. A Lionhead rabbit\u2019s coat is their pride and joy. In order to maintain its soft, matt-free appearance, they need to be brushed at least once a week during non-shedding season. When shedding season comes, these rabbits go through a molt and need daily brushings to keep its wool clean. There are two kinds of \u201cmane\u201d types that the Lionhead rabbit breed can have. They can feature a single mane (a wispy, thin mane around its head, ears, chin and sometimes on the chest and rum) or a double mane (like the single mane, only much thicker, and wool on their flanks that some refer to as a \u201cskirt\u201d). The length of their wool around their heads usually does not exceed 2 inches. There are several unique features about the Lionhead\u2019s coat. Besides the 2 inches of length, a Lionhead\u2019s \u201cmane\u201d has to form a full circle around the head in order to meet the breed standards. This mane also has to extend into a V shape towards the back of the neck. In some cases, the mane can extend and fall forward between the ears, creating a distinct fringe that is known as a \u201cwool cap\u201d. The length of the coat on the cheeks can vary in certain specimens, and the longer ones are quite a prized feature.  According to the ARBA Standards, Lionhead rabbits are recognized in black, chocolate, blue, tortoise, blue point, blue-eyed white, ruby-eyed white, chestnut agouti, seal, silver marten, smoke pearl, pointed white, sable point, and Siamese sable. They do not have any particular markings as per the ARBA Standards. Once comfortable, this rabbit will kick back, relax in its den and groom itself with its paws. In order to see their personalities blossom,  Lionhead rabbits need plenty of time outside of their enclosures to explore and form a lasting bond with their human families. We recommend keeping this small rabbit in an indoor enclosure, as outdoor ones are more exposed to the weather (rain or shine) and predators such as coyotes, dogs, racoons, etc. Of course, a pet rabbit can require a good deal more attention than a dog or a cat \u2013 they are smaller, more vulnerable, and less aware of their surroundings. It is strongly recommended that outdoor activities that are not 100% safe for your rabbit are done with the help of a leashed vest. That way you will ensure plenty of security while your rabbit can explore and enjoy the outdoors. \nTheir indoor enclosure however should be made of wire, be large enough for them to stretch out in and have one or two toys and have a plastic bottom. The bottom should be laid with good quality bedding (some pet parents like using small amounts of horse bedding) and should be spot cleaned every day and completely replaced every week. Rabbits, like most pets, enjoy a cozy, warm nook to lounge in, just like nature dictates. Make sure that the indoor enclosure has plenty of that cozy, den-style comfort. Their diet should consist of mainly hay (70 percent). The rest of their diet should be pellets and rabbit-safe fruits, leafy greens and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables  can also be used as incentives or treats to reward your bunny whenever they complete a task or obey a command (such as sitting, staying, or using their litter box). Adult rabbits can eat about 1/4 cup of high fiber pellets everyday for every 5 lbs. they weigh, so keep that in mind when feeding your Lionhead, as they are relatively small. Any doubts you might have regarding their diet can always be addressed to your vet. Rabbit diet is an important aspect of their overall care, and it is always better to talk it through with the experts. Like any rabbit breed, there are some health concerns that should be regularly monitored in order to raise a happy, healthy rabbit. A rabbit\u2019s teeth, for instance, never stops growing and is only filed down by a diet rich in hay. Should your rabbit not be eating enough hay, their teeth may overgrow and poke into their faces and jaws. To prevent this, make sure your rabbit diet consists of 70 percent hay (such as timothy) and periodically check their mouths for any overgrown teeth. Also be wary of ear mites that can grow inside your Lionhead rabbit\u2019s ears. Symptoms include scratching more than usual in one or both ears and they may even have some fur loss on the ears. If you suspect your rabbit has ear mites, take them to your local veterinarian to get treated. It isn\u2019t a reason for excessive worrying \u2013 mites are a somewhat regular occurence that can be treated fairly easily if spotted on time. Most domesticated rabbits also carry the E. cuniculi parasite, which is an abbreviation for Encephalitozoon cuniculi. While this parasite is present, a large percentage of domestic rabbits will not be hurt by it, however if the rabbit is overly stressed, the parasite may become active. Symptoms include a head tilt, paralysis, excessive urination and decreased vision. Consult your local veterinarian to learn more about this parasite or if you suspect your rabbit is suffering from it. Female Lionhead rabbits who have been spayed have a decreased risk of developing uterine cancer, so it\u2019s a good idea to get your doe spayed as young as four months of age. Bucks can be neutered as young as three and a half months old. The Lionhead rabbit has a wool mane circling around their head much like a lion\u2019s mane, hence its name. This breed of rabbit is energetic, affectionate and absolutely loves to play. They make wonderful family pets as they love to be picked up, held and petted as often as their human handlers like! Their outgoing character is one of the many things that makes them such a loveable pet. They enjoy roaming around their designated rabbit room, chasing humans around playfully and having plenty of toys they can chew and balls they can play with. Their small sizes make them wonderful apartment dwellers and a great pet for homes so long as they have plenty of time out of their enclosures so they can play and bond with their human family. Once comfortable, this rabbit will kick back, relax in its den and groom itself with its paws. While it enjoys playing and roaming around wherever you let him, they will also happily become tiny little \u201clap dogs\u201d when the time comes to watch some television after a hard day\u2019s work. Their even temperaments and sweet nature also makes them perfect pets for couples, singles, seniors or retirees who would like some furry companionship. Rabbits are a little harder to litter train than rabbits and dogs, but it is possible. They tend to \u201cgo\u201d in one particular corner of their enclosures so they associate whatever material is used in that corner as the ideal place to do the deed. Consequently, should you place a few of these litter boxes with the same material in different corners of your home, your rabbit may put two and two together. Should they successfully do their business in the correct place, always make sure to reward them with a small piece of fruit or rabbit-safe vegetable.", "facts": " Compact Singles, Seniors, House/Apartment, Families with children, Indoor rabbits Friendly, affectionate, energetic", "tags": "affectionate rabbits, ear mites, family rabbits, kid-friendly rabbits, lionhead rabbits, pet rabbits, rabbits with mane, "}, "meissner lop": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/meissner-lop/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/meissner-lop.jpg", "name": "Meissner Lop", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Meissner Lop is one of the oldest German rabbit breeds, but it is so rare today that is considered endangered. This breed got it start in 1900, when Leopold Reck, from Meissner (hence the name), decided to breed a large rabbit with a silvery fur, which was quite popular at the time. Although the true origin of the Meissner Lop rabbit is unknown, it is believed that it is the results of crossing French Lop with Mini Silver Rabbit. Even though it\u2019s not commonly found today, there are many breeders interested in preserving this stunning rabbit breed. Meissner Lop is mostly bred in Europe, and it is recognized by The British Rabbit Council (BRA). A rare and beautiful breed, Meissner Lop rabbits are an excellent choice for a pet, as they have great, lively personality and sweet nature. Considered to be medium to large sized, Meissner Lop rabbits weigh from 7.5 to 10 lbs. Apart from their unique shimmery coat, these rabbits share most of their physical traits with other lop rabbits. Their body type is compact, and their bodies are stocky, slightly stretched, with arched, well rounded back. Meissner Lop rabbits have a rounded head with the distinct long ears that fall to the sides of their head. Meissner Lop rabbits have a beautiful, soft fur. Their coats are very dense, with plenty of guard hair, and of medium length- their hair is around 3 centimeters long. But the most distinctive quality of Meissner Lop\u2019s coat is the silver ticking, which gives it a shimmery, shiny effect. None of the other Lop breeds display this silver dusting, which makes this breed unique. Their fur is easy to groom and doesn\u2019t require any special attention, except during the molting season, when these rabbits should be brushed more often, to help them with shedding and prevent hair from ending up in their digestive tract. The Meissner Lop rabbit comes in all self colors, but only four of them are recognized- black, blue, yellow and Havana. Black and Blue Meissner Lops are the most common, while other colors are rarely found, due to their diminished numbers. Regardless of the color of the coat, their fur is always silvered evenly throughout the body (less so on the ears and legs), giving the hair a mesmerizing sheen. Meissner Lop rabbit is unique among the lop breeds because of their silver-dusted hair. When it comes to living conditions, Meissner Lop rabbits are no different than other breeds. They can be kept indoors or outdoors, provided that all their needs are met, but, if you want to keep this breed as a family pet, it\u2019s best to keep them in your home. That way, the rabbit can socialize better with his family and will be much friendlier to people. In both cases, your bunny will need a proper enclosure to spend their time in. Due to their size, Meissner Lop rabbits will require a relatively large enclosure, in which they can lounge around, stretch their legs and sit. The floor of the hutch or the enclosure should be lined with rabbit-friendly bedding, which is to be cleaned daily and replaced entirely every week. Meissner Lop rabbits are well known as lively and friendly, and they need to be let out of their enclosures each day for some quality playtime. However, when you allow your bunny outside, whether in your yard or indoors, you need to make sure to create a safe environment for them. Inside your home, you\u2019ll need to rabbit-proof everything, hiding or removing any items that could hurt them or that they could damage, like electric cables or dangerous foods. In the outdoor areas, their playing space needs to be fenced and protected from potential predators. Their diet is the same as that of any other rabbit. They require a lot of hay, with the addition of pellets, fruits, and veggies and a constant source of fresh water. Meissner Lop rabbits are known as good feeders, so they are not usually picky and have a healthy appetite. Meissner Lop rabbits don\u2019t have any hereditary diseases or breed-specific health issues, but they do need proper care to lead long and healthy lives. The most common problems that affect all rabbit breeds are overgrown teeth, GI stasis, and viruses such as myxomatosis (prevented by vaccination). Rabbit\u2019s teeth continuously grow throughout their life, so it\u2019s essential to provide them with a way to grind them down. This means you\u2019ll need to feed them a lot of roughage, like hay, which helps their teeth stay in good shape. But, rabbits don\u2019t only nibble on hay and carrots. They are big on grooming themselves, which often leads to hairballs getting stuck in their digestive tract. Since rabbits can\u2019t vomit the hair out (like cats), the hair blocks their intestines, which, if left untreated, can have fatal consequences. To prevent this, groom your bunny regularly and watch out for any warning signs- constipation, lethargy, loss of appetite or poop connected by strands of hair. Unless you plan on breeding your rabbits, you should consider spaying or neutering. It\u2019s a simple, routine procedure that will make them more calm and docile, prevent potential problems with reproductive organs, and eliminate the possibility of urine marking. Playful, sweet, and friendly, these rabbits make lovely family pets. Not unlike all Lop breeds, Meissner Lop rabbits are friendly, affectionate and sweet-tempered. However, Silver Rabbits are a part of their ancestry, which means these bunnies are more active and lively than other lop rabbits. They will need to be let out of their enclosures each day, because they like to roam about and spend all that energy.  Meissner Lop rabbits love playing, so bunny toys and some quality playtime with their owner is all they need to be happy. They enjoy attention and being petted and make great pets for singles or seniors. As they have a good character and are relatively calm, they can be an excellent choice for families with older children, as well. However, it is important to educate your kids how to safely handle a rabbit, to prevent injuries or accidents. If you plan on keeping a rabbit as a pet in your apartment or house, litter training them will make things much easier for both you and them. Even though rabbits are not as easy to potty train like, say, cats, with a little patience and effort they can be taught to \u201cdo their business\u201d in a designated area.", "facts": " Compact Singles, Seniors, House/Apartment, Families with older children, First-time owners, Outdoor/Indoor Rabbits Friendly, playful, gentle", "tags": "affectionate rabbit breeds, cute rabbit breeds, family-friendly rabbit breeds, friendly rabbit breeds, Meissner Lop, meissner lop rabbit, playful rabbits, silver coat, "}, "mellerud rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/mellerud-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mellerud-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Mellerud Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Sharing part of its history with the Gotland Rabbit, the Mellerud Rabbit is an old breed of farm rabbits that had been common throughout Sweden. The rabbits became known as farm rabbits around 1881, and they were primarily kept for their fur and their meat. However, the farm rabbits disappeared from a majority of Sweden in the 1900s, causing many people to believe that they had gone extinct. In the latter part of the 1990s, though, a few of the old farm type rabbits were found in Mellerud at the home of an older woman known as Edith i Sj\u00f6skogen, who had kept rabbits since around 1937. This line of rabbits was believed to be older than 1937, and the only time an outside breed was added to this line was in 1968, with the addition of one male and one female black and white rabbit. In the early 2000s, as this population started to dwindle, Edith gave up seven rabbits that would provide the foundation for a breeding project directed at preserving the breed. It was not until 2011 that the Mellerud Rabbit finally received official landrace status by Jordbruksverket. Today, the Gotland Rabbit Society is also responsible for preserving the Mellerud Rabbit, as it is a rare breed. Only about 160 rabbits were registered as of 2013, so breeders are working on increasing that number for high genetic diversity. The Mellerud Rabbit is a rare breed. When it comes to this breed\u2019s conformation, it is similar to that of the Gotland Rabbit. Bucks are typically a bit more compact and will feature a thicker muzzle and rounder head. The does have a body that is relatively elongated, and they also feature a fine head. However, the bucks and does weigh the same amount. The eyes should have an alert expression and be somewhat large, while the ears should be medium in length, as well as relatively thin. The ears should also be pointed instead of rounded. The coat of the Mellerud Rabbit should be short and fine. A Mellerud Rabbit\u2019s fur will either be black with spotting, known as Dutch rabbit markings, or albino. There\u2019s a high degree of variation when it comes to the white markings on the Mellerud then there is in most traditional show breeds because the breeders never made it a goal to standardize the Mellerud Rabbit\u2019s markings. Also, most of these rabbits will have white on the front of the chest, along with a white muzzle, white front paws, and blazes to varying degrees. The white markings might even extend to the back, shoulders, hind legs, and sides of the face. Eye colors include blue, brown, or a mix of those two colors. Overall, the Mellerud Rabbit is considered strong and hardy. You can house your Mellerud Rabbit indoors or outside, as the breed is hardy and adapted to all climates. However, you should provide your outdoor rabbit with a large enough hutch that is safe from the elements, dry, and protected from harsh sunlight, drafts, and predators. Always ensure that your pet has access to fresh, clean water. These rabbits can be fed high quality hays, fresh grass, and a variety of vegetables. While pellets might be too high in calories for the Mellerud and other landrace breeds, you can provide them to your pet as a treat or in small amounts, rather than as a main part of his diet. Overall, the Mellerud Rabbit is considered strong and hardy. Be sure to provide your pet with a safe, stress-free, and clean environment in which to grow and explore, whether indoors or outside, and check your rabbit\u2019s teeth regularly to ensure that they are not becoming overgrown. Giving your pet plenty of fibrous vegetables and gnaw toys will help keep the teeth at the appropriate length and prevent problems. You should also make it a point to feed your rabbit the appropriate amount of food to prevent excess weight gain. When rabbits gain too much weight, they find it difficult to groom themselves, and that makes them vulnerable to flystrike. Finally, you can talk to your vet about vaccinations for your rabbit, as well as the option to spay or neuter your pet if you are not planning on breeding your rabbits. The Mellerud Rabbit is known for being lively and curious. Known for being lively and curious, the Mellerud Rabbit is also a bit calmer when compared to the similar Gotland Rabbit. Because they are good-natured and calm, these rabbits make wonderful pets. Like other rabbits, you should be gentle and calm when handling your Mellerud. Many breeds are not appropriate for young children, but if your older children know how to care for, pick up, and handle a rabbit, this breed will make a good family pet.

In fact, anyone who is serious about owning the finest and most adorable bunny available on the market needs to look into the exciting world of designer rabbits. These remarkably cute and desirable little pets have been taking the world by storm for decades and none of them are more popular or beloved than the Mini Lop. With their irresistible looks and plenty of positive character traits, they make great pets in so many ways. And in the end, one thing remains certain \u2013 if you like cute, cuddly, and infinitely fluffy, you will adore a Mini Lop rabbit. The Mini Lop originated in Germany when a German Lop was bred with a small Chinchilla rabbit. The newly developed breed became known as the Klein Widder or \u201cLittle hanging ear.\u201d Due to the distinct parent breeds, the Mini Lop has quite a unique look, mixing that fluffiness and rounded look of a Chinchilla, with the rabbit features of a German Lop. Besides the Klein Widder nickname, these rabbits have many names, but no matter what you choose to call them, these little darlings are certain to melt your heart. The soft and cuddly looks are hard to resist, as is their personality.  In the early \u201970s, a Californian breeder named Bob Herschbach spotted this newly developed breed at a show in Essen, Germany, and consequently brought a trio of them to the United States. He began breeding them and crossing the breed with a Standard Chinchilla rabbit. The first rabbit of this kind was presented to the American Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) with the name \u201cKlein Widder,\u201d but the name changed to the Mini Lop in 1974. The Mini Lop was successfully accepted into the ARBA later in 1980 by a man named Herby Dyke. Ever since then, bunny lovers everywhere have been seeking out Mini Lops to fill the rabbit sized holes in their hearts. Their \u201crise to fame\u201d amongst show rabbit breeds was nothing short of stellar, and the Mini Lop soon became a favorite of many. The Mini Lop makes an excellent pet for families with children and seniors. You might not find the words \u201cfuzzy basketball with a head\u201d in the ARBA Standard of Perfection for the Mini Lop, but it really does sum up how an ideal representative of what this breed should look like. The Mini Lop has a compact body type and is among the smaller rabbit breeds. An adult Mini Lop should weigh anywhere from 3 to 6 pounds, with the does being smaller than bucks. Regardless of their ultimate size, they all share signature circular body type: little furry balls of joy. In a nutshell, the rounded and soft looks is the go-to appearance for a Mini Lop. The fur is super soft and allows for a close trim.   The body is massive and thickest, despite its relatively small size. It is heavily-muscled and well-rounded, and dewlap is permitted for the females of the species. The neck should be as short as possible, with the broad head sitting close to their compact bodies (often it appears like they don\u2019t have a neck at all). As the name of the breed suggests, the rounded and well-furred ears sit lopping vertically to the sides of the head. They almost look like pigtails. Or, to sum it up, the Mini Lop is an adorable pudgy bunny whose cute looks leave no one indifferent! To gaze upon the Mini Lop is to fall in love with adorable rabbit perfection.  Mini Lops have a luxurious soft, medium-length rollback coat. However, despite their gorgeous fur, they do not require much care in the grooming department compared to wooly breeds such as the English Angora. Weekly brushings are all that\u2019s necessary to keep their coat soft will be enough for the most part. But some owners may wish to increase the amount of grooming to twice a week during molting periods, which usually occur twice a year. That could be a wise choice just to be safe. In addition to helping keep rabbit hair off your furniture, frequent brushing during periods of increased shedding can also protect your pet\u2019s health. As avid self-groomers, rabbits can ingest a lot of their own hair by accident, which can seriously endanger them if a hairball forms in the intestine. By helping them get rid of loose hair with brushing, you minimize the possibility of your pet rabbit getting sick. So, it might be wise to monitor your Mini Lop\u2019s molting seasons to avoid any unnecessary health issues. If your Mini Lop is a proud show rabbit, you need to remember that their coat needs to meet certain standards that are expected for the breed. The ideal Mini Lop coat should be quite thick and dense, sporting that iconic sheen, overall looking glossy and lustrous. It also has to be medium in length with a good roll back. Coat that is extremely short, too long, thin, silky, or harsh, is seen as a fault on shows. The ARBA accepts a range of colors and markings for the Mini Lop. There are seven different color groups that are common with this breed: agouti, broken, pointed white, self, shaded, ticked, and wide band. These categorizations might not mean much if you\u2019re new to the world of rabbits, but they do make it clear that there\u2019s a pattern or a shade of the Mini Lop to match anyone\u2019s preference. Some of the most common colors spotted in Mini Lops are \u2013 amongst others \u2013 Chocolate, Ruby-eyed white, Opal, Lynx, White, Black, Chestnut Agouti, Chinchilla, Blue-eyed white, Lilac, Orange, Blue, and Tri Color. Such variation is not often spotted in the world of pet rabbits, and allows for plenty of diversity in shows as well as for people that are picking out a pet. Whether you want a tri-colored, solid black, or anything in between, you\u2019ll be able to find it! Yet another reason why the Mini Lop has become such a beloved option for rabbit owners. They aren\u2019t just adorable, they are practically customizable.  Mini Lops should be out of their enclosures to play and create a lasting bond with their human handlers. Like all rabbits, Mini Lops need an adequate enclosure to live their lives, eat, sleep, etc. Outdoor enclosures should be raised and have enough space for the rabbit to stretch their legs out comfortably. It should also have a ramp that lowers to the bottom of their fenced enclosure so they can feel some grass and ground beneath their feet. This is something that your outdoor Mini Lop will sincerely appreciate. On the other hand, indoor rabbits should have a wire enclosure that also allows them enough space to stretch out and of course, a corner to do their business. Their bedding should be spot-cleaned every day so they can lay down on clean and soft bedding. It should be completely replenished every week. Health issues can arise surprisingly quickly if rabbit owners don\u2019t pay careful attention to the cleanliness of their rabbits home. It is a responsibility that needs to be taken quite seriously. Thankfully, the Mini Lop\u2019s diet does not differ from any other rabbit breed. That means they require a diet consisting of 70 percent good-quality hay such as orchard hay or timothy hay (the occasional alfalfa grass snack would also be good for their overall health). The rest of the diet should be a nice balance of fruits, leafy greens, vegetables, and pellets. Like hay, there are plenty types of pellets available on the market, some with higher protein content than others. While lower quality pellets can cost quite a bit less, it\u2019s really not worth it if you care about the health and happiness of your pet. It\u2019s also a good idea to be aware of what kind of fruits, leafy greens, and vegetables you have in your home because some are rabbit-safe and others are absolutely not. In fact, most leafy greens are unsafe as they can cause digestive issues, especially if you feed your rabbit a large amount of it. Feed your rabbit greens that are high in fiber and nutrients (such as romaine lettuce) and be aware of what kind of fruits you\u2019re feeding (nothing too high in sugar). Your rabbit might seem to enjoy other greens and fruits more, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are the healthiest choice. You know, just like humans. Mini Lops should be allowed out of their enclosures to play and create a lasting bond with their human handlers as often as possible. Remember to bunny-proof any room that your indoor rabbit resides in, as they will often chew on anything they deem a toy. That could be a harmless (but pricey) mistake or something far more unfortunate.  Should you wish to provide your rabbit with some outdoor fun, remember to place them in a fenced portion of your yard (there are a few rabbit proof fences readily available online or at pet stores) and always have an adult present to supervise and shield your rabbit from any dangers (such as racoons, dogs, etc). Indoor rabbits love to have outdoor adventures, but they won\u2019t be nearly as cautious as their humans might prefer when left to their own devices. So be careful. Mini Lops are not susceptible to any particular disease, but there are a few health concerns  that every pet rabbit owner needs to be aware of. With their needs met and proper living conditions provided, there are thankfully not many problems that these bunnies face. Please keep that in mind and make sure to provide the best possible life to your pet. It\u2019s obvious advice, but there are sadly far too many pet owners out there don\u2019t take their responsibilities seriously.  First and foremost, if a rabbit goes outside, they are very susceptible to flystrike, a condition in which flies lay their eggs on soiled patches of fur (usually around their rear). When the eggs hatch, their main source of nutrition is the rabbit itself and they will start to devour the rabbit from the inside out, causing excruciating pain.  Symptoms include seizures, loss of motion (listlessness) and skin irritations. These parasites are something out of a horror movie and you absolutely do not want to be a supporting character in that nightmare. All rabbits are avid groomers and will ingest a lot of their own hair while cleaning themselves- similar to cats. Unlike felines, though, rabbits can\u2019t vomit, so any hairballs that form in the intestine can become stuck and cause blockage or GI stasis. The preventive includes regular brushing and feeding a lot of roughage. This condition can be life-threatening if not noticed on time, so pay attention to common signs. No poop or very little of it, lethargy ,and loss of appetite all point to hairball blockage. If you notice any of these signs, rush your pet to a veterinarian with experience in small animals. This problem is common enough to be easily rectified by an experienced vet, but timing is crucial. So keep and eye on your Mini Lop and act quickly if you notice any of these warning signs.  Additionally, always be sure to check your rabbit\u2019s teeth, as they continuously grow throughout their entire lives and are usually worn down by a high-hay diet. If their teeth are overgrown, they may pierce their jaw and/or faces, which also causes a lot of pain and limits your rabbit\u2019s ability to eat. So make sure that both you and your vet monitor their teeth growth, especially later in life.  Also, be sure to also carefully inspect your rabbit\u2019s ears for ear mites. These parasites easily infect rabbits in direct contact with a bunny that\u2019s already infested, so make sure to take all of your pets to the vet if you notice even one of them displaying the signs such as ear scratching, head shaking or anything odd about appearance of their ears. This problem can also get out of hand very quickly, so getting him to a vet soon after noticing any warning signs is quite important.  The Mini Lop is often described as being a \u201cbasketball with a head.\u201d These medium-sized rabbits are known to be the cuddliest pet rabbits around and are often described as looking like teddy bears because of their adorable looks and affectionate nature. True to their nicknames, they are indeed great pets for children to pick up, and more than happy to be petted from head to little fuzzy tail! Like most rabbits, their personalities bloom when they are given plenty of time to be out of their enclosures where they can safely roam around their rabbit-proof room or outside in a fenced portion of the yard.  Your rabbit may also benefit from having a few toys to nibble on and play with. This can be as simple as an empty toilet paper roll or as complex as a mentally stimulating rabbit-safe toy from your local pet shop. Because of their sweet disposition, Mini Lops make excellent pets not only for families with children (both younger or older), but also for couples, singles, and seniors who are looking for a cuddly companion. It\u2019s hard to find anyone who wouldn\u2019t fall in love with one if these beautiful little bunnies. Most rabbits are a little more difficult to train than the common house cat or dog, however it is not impossible. Litter training is possible with lots of patience, rewards, and a few well-placed litter boxes around the house. Teaching your Mini Lop stop, come or perform other common commands and tricks will come with time and plenty of repetition. It is important to note that Mini Lops will do best in a calmer family surrounding. Kids that are too eager to play and careless might prove to be too much for a fluffy Mini Lop, and stress them out. The ideal environment is a loving family household with older children that know how to care for a pet. Nevertheless, while a Mini Lop is a friendly and loving pet, it won\u2019t hesitate to show its \u201cangrier\u201d side as well. Of course, you won\u2019t be able to take them seriously due to their immensely cute looks, but hey \u2013 it is what it is. A Mini Lop might show displeasure by vigorously stamping their hind foot. This happens for example when strangers happen to invade their place, or some daily routine is not met.\n Also, remember that a Mini Lop pet will need plenty of time outside. Rabbits naturally crave open air and grassy environments to play in and \u201cexercise\u201d. A pet rabbit that is often cooped up indoors or in a cramped environment can develop unhealthy habits and a despondent mood. However, when you take your bunny outside for playtime and some fresh air, it is crucial to make sure that they are safely enclosed and protected from potential predators- such as birds of prey or neighborhood cats and dogs.", "facts": " Compact Singles, Seniors, House or Apartment, Families with children, First-time owners, Indoor/Outdoor rabbits Friendly, playful, affectionate", "tags": "american mini lop rabbit, basketball with a head, family rabbits, Flystrike, Klein Widder, mini lop, rabbits for first-time owners, rabbits for kids, "}, "mini rex rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/mini-rex-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mini-rex.jpg", "name": "Mini Rex Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "When seeking out a rabbit, most people will merely get whatever is available. This is a mistake. Like any other popular pet, there are a variety of rabbits out there with a variety of qualities. Not every rabbit is the right choice for every home. So how will you be able to spot the all-star rabbits from the bargain basement bunnies? Well, fortunately you\u2019ve come to the right place. We\u2019ve been taking a look at the finest rabbits out there, breed by breed. To day we explore the qualities of the Mini Rex Rabbit. Is this the right rabbit to bring into your family? Keep your eyeballs glued to this page and scroll on to find out. The Rex fur gene in rabbits was first discovered in 1900s France. Soon after that, these types of rabbits were being bred all over the world. Their popularity exploded. You might even say that they bred like rabbits (please excuse the pun, it was irresistible). The ARBA recognized the original Rex Rabbit breed- these bunnies weigh about 9 lbs, but demand grew for a smaller version. As a result, the Mini Rex Rabbit was born. A rabbit that crammed all of the beloved qualities of the Rex into a tiny little furball.  The Mini Rex breed was first developed by Monna R. Berryhill of Texas, who bred a black Dwarf Rex buck and a undersized Lynx Red doe. The litter produced seven kits, marking the first of the new breed.  In 1986, Berryhill introduced the Mini Rex Rabbit, and the American Rabbit Breeders\u2019 Association (ARBA) recognized it as a new breed of rabbit. Every since then, the Mini Rex has been a favourite pet of rabbit lovers everywhere. The Mini Rex rabbit is a popular breed for families looking for a first-time pet for their children. The Mini Rex might be the pet that finally proves once and for all that size doesn\u2019t matter. The diminutive size of these bunnies didn\u2019t diminish their beauty. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite! Rex rabbits are known for their well-proportioned physique, luxurious coat, and overall charming appearance. The miniature size of The Mini Rex rabbit only increases their appeal. It\u2019s everything that everyone loves about the Rex packed into a tiny package that is even more adorable in every conceivable way.  At half the size of the standard Rex, these rabbits weigh between 3 and 4.5 pounds when fully mature. The does (females) are bigger than the bucks (males). The Mini Rex Rabbit has a compact body type. Their backs are rounded, with well-developed shoulders, hindquarters, and midsection. The body is well-filled, the depth and width of it in balance. Legs are straight and rather short. When it comes to the head, it should be relatively close to to the shoulders, with a short neck, giving these bunnies an ever more compact appearance. The ears are thick and upright- their maximum length is 3.5 inches. A gorgeous physique that can only be described as a mini masterpiece of rabbit design.  The Mini Rex rabbit has a distinct kind of fur that is different than the long, soft wool of the English Angora, for example. The Mini Rex rabbit does not have any long guard hairs protecting its underfur. Ontop of that the secondary guard hairs are the same length as the undercoat, which means that all you can feel is the fine hairs that have a texture reminiscent of velvet. Petting the Mini Rex Rabbit is a luxurious treat that everyone deserves to experience at least once in their lives. This breed\u2019s fur is short (ideally 5/8 inch in length), smooth and springy, and not too soft or silky. The fur should also be extremely dense, straight, and upright. The good news is that maintaining that beautiful coat doesn\u2019t require much effort. Their short fur does not need much maintenance. In fact, owners should try not to brush this rabbit breed\u2019s coat too often, as it may actually damage its texture. Groom only when necessary, but no more than once every other week. Should its coat get dirty, simply spot-clean it with a damp cloth. So, be very careful with your Mini Rex\u2019s coat if you want to enjoy those velvety pleasures. Mini Rex rabbits comes in a rainbow of colors and markings, far too many to mention here, but we\u2019ll try. These include sable, castor, blue, himalayan, lilac, lynx, opal, broken (any accepted variety with white), tricolour (white with colors such as black and orange, chocolate and orange, blue and fawn, etc.), and pattern (a broken pattern with nose makings, eye markings, colors ears, and tail and body spots). There is a Mini Rex Rabbit out there to suit any colour preference. It\u2019s just a matter of putting in the effort to find the rabbit of your dreams. It\u2019s out there somewhere. Search away! Don\u2019t brush the Mini Rex\u2019s coat too often, as it may actually damage the fur\u2019s texture. The first thing you should get for your new pet is a home of their own. Rabbits need to have a safe space to sleep in, eat in, and of course, do their business in. There are a few options available when purchasing a proper rabbit enclosure. Apartment dwellers may opt to have an indoor rabbit cage as a primary residence for their pet (or as a safe nook for them to retreat too after spending most of their time hopping freely around the apartment). Whatever the case is with your bunny, their safety and comfort should be your primary concern. You are making a home for your rabbit, after all. Not just any enclosure will do if you truly love your rabbit. Needless to say, not all rabbit hutches, cages, and enclosures are made alike. They certainly are not all meant to be considered equal.  Indoor rabbit enclosures should be made of bunny-safe wire with a plastic bottom in order to place rabbit-friendly bedding at the base. The wire should be strong and durable, as bunnies like to chew everything and could easily gnaw their way through a week cage. Regardless of the material that you choose, it should be on the bottom of the cage. Wire bottoms are hard on rabbit\u2019s feet and will cause discomfort and injury (even sore hocks are a common side effect of standing on wire, so choose your base wisely). As for the bedding, choose rabbit friendly options such as shredded paper or cardboard, wood pellets, straw or hay. The bedding will need to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced every week. Nobody said that taking care of a rabbit was easy. Like any type of pet ownership, there are significant responsibilities involved. You have to be prepared to deliver if you intend to treat your rabbit right.  If you have a fenced backyard, you can also purchase or build your own rabbit hutch. You could even construct your own a rabbit shed if you are really committed. However if you have an outdoor enclosure for your rabbit, always be aware of outdoor temperatures, how much sun your rabbit is exposed to, and if there are any local predators you should be wary of (racoons, birds, coyotes, etc.). These little furballs need to be looked out for. Rabbits kept in this manner are often more susceptible to illness, they are much less friendly and social around humans, and, for all intents and purposes, they won\u2019t be a cuddly pet whose company you get to enjoy when you live with them. So, while your rabbit may appreciate an outdoor lifestyle, it may not foster the type of relationship that you hope to have with your pet.  In addition to proper housing, you should provide a well-balanced, healthy diet to your Mini Rex Rabbit. All rabbits need a diet composed mostly of pellets and hay (about 70 percent). Adult rabbits will eat about 1/4 cup of high-fiber pellets everyday for every 5 pounds they weigh (Mini Rex rabbits, for instance, would not need more than 1/4 a day since they are typically small). They will also enjoy fresh fruits, leafy greens, and vegetables including carrots, watercress, red or green lettuce, celery, mango, pear, peach, and more. Remember to research what you\u2019re feeding your rabbit before giving it to them. Some foods may be dangerous to its health (apples are great, but their seeds contain tiny amounts of cyanide). Never consider your rabbit a means of disposing of any extra produce taking up space in your fridge. Just because rabbits will eat just about anything, doesn\u2019t mean they should. Be careful about what food you put in your rabbit\u2019s cage. With good basic care and living conditions, your Mini Rex Rabbit probably won\u2019t be raking up vet bills. Rabbits are fairly healthy animals when they are living in a healthy environment and have all of their needs met. However, there are a few potential issues you should be aware of. For instance, bunnies are prone to teeth problems. Yep, those iconic rabbit chompers can quickly turn into a health hazard if you aren\u2019t careful.   You see, unlike most animals, rabbit teeth never stop growing. Thankfully, they are also constantly being worn down by everyday activities such as chewing their food (mostly hay). If your rabbit\u2019s teeth are not being worn down at the right rate, its teeth may start growing into its  jaw and face. Obviously, this sort of overgrowth can cause your rabbit severe pain. Signs of overgrown teeth or an infection due to overgrown teeth may include loss of appetite, sluggish activity, and drooling. Be sure to check your rabbit\u2019s mouth weekly for signs of overgrown teeth. If you suspect an infection, bring your pet to the vet right away. Another issue that all rabbits deal with is snuffles. This is a respiratory disease whose symptoms are watery eyes, sneezing and runny nose. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not as benign as it sounds. This is no common cold that rabbits can shake off. The condition is caused by pasteurellosis bacteria, which causes sores, abscesses and even blindness in rabbits. However, you can solve this with good hygiene in the rabbit\u2019s enclosure and timely treatment with antibiotics. So keep an eye out for any of those symptoms and take your rabbit to the vet promptly if any of these symptoms pop up.  Should you decide to spay or neuter your rabbit, does can be spayed once they are 4-6 months old while bucks can be neutered as young as 3.5 months old. Fixing your rabbit is recommended unless you plan on breeding them, as it will eliminate the possibility of some behavioral issues (marking in males) and minimize health risks (uterine cancer in females).  The Mini Rex rabbit has a rounded back with well-developed shoulders, hindquarters and midsection. The Mini Rex rabbit is a popular rabbit breed for families looking for a first-time pet for their children. Because of its quiet, calm nature, these bunnies are also wonderful choices for couples, singles or retirees looking for a little bundle of joy. Kits (baby rabbits) shouldn\u2019t be alone with children without supervision. Rabbits often squirm and may fall if the child is not holding securely enough. Should your child be holding the rabbit, make sure they are siting on the ground to minimize risk of falling. Rabbits are harder to train than other pets, but it definitely isn\u2019t impossible. Training rabbits to stay, come, or even potty train comes with lots of time, patience and rewards (preferably a piece of food). Owners must approach rabbits with an extremely patient mindset in order to train. Never yell or shout at your rabbit when you become frustrated. Rabbits may become aggressive or refuse to participate in any further training. When it comes to toys, rabbits do benefit from having some entertainment. Your rabbit may even enjoy simple DIY toys like stuffed toilet paper rolls or store-purchased items. It\u2019s all up to your rabbit\u2019s individual personality!", "facts": " Compact Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors, House/Apartment Rabbits, Families with children,  First-time owners, Indoor Rabbits Calm, curious, friendly", "tags": "family-friendly rabbits, mini rex rabbit, rabbits for seniors, rex rabbits, "}, "mini satin rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/mini-satin-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/mini-satin-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Mini Satin Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Standard-sized Satin rabbits were popular in the mid-1930s, when these satinized Havanas were bred by Mr. Walter Huey, a well-known breeder. By the 1970s a woman by the name of Ariel Hayes of Michigan tried to breed Mini Satin Rabbit, but gave up her quest in 1892. However, the search was not over. From the mid 1980-1999, many breeders contributed to trying to create the small Satin rabbits. Mr. J Leo Collins obtained a Certificate of Development and created only two varieties of the Mini Satin: the red and the albino world. The red-eyed white Mini Satin was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association in 2006. Since then, there have been many more colors accepted by the ARBA. If you socialize the Mini Satin Rabbit from the start, it will make a wonderful companion. The Mini Satin Rabbit has a compact body that weighs anywhere from 3-4.5 lbs once it is fully grown. It is short and well-rounded when viewed from any direction and has a round, full head. Like the standard Satin rabbit, the Mini Satin Rabbit\u2019s coat has a beautiful, shiny fur that is appealing, especially at shows. It does not need much maintenance in order to keep its fur in tip-top shape; a bi-weekly brushing with a slicker brush is sufficient. If your indoor rabbit is shedding a more than usual, it is probably because it is either spring or fall, the time of year when rabbits tend to shed. Increase the brushings to every week and you will notice less stray hairs. Remember never to bathe your rabbit but instead, spot clean it with a damp cloth when and where necessary. There are quite a few color varieties accepted by the ARBA when it comes to Mini Satin rabbits. Colors include black, blue, broken (any color mixed with white), chocolate, chocolate agouti, copper, chinchilla, opal, otter, red, siamese, silver marten, tortoise, and white. Owners much approach Mini Satin rabbits with an extremely patient mindset when it comes to training. The Mini Satin\u2019s small size makes it an excellent rabbit for both houses and apartments, as it do not need much space or a large enclosure to keep it happy. Because of its small size, it isn\u2019t recommended for outdoor enclosures, as predators may make quick dinner out of them. Indoor enclosures need to be made of wire with a solid bottom and need to be large enough to allow the Mini Satin to comfortably sleep, eat and play inside. The bottom should be laid with bedding/hay; it needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. Rabbits will enjoy a diet composed mostly of pellets and hay (about 70 percent). Adult rabbits will eat about 1/4 cup of high-fiber pellets everyday for every 5 pounds they weigh (Mini Satins, for instance, would not need more than 1/4 a day since they are  small). It will also enjoy fresh fruits, leafy greens and vegetables including carrots, watercress, red or green lettuce, celery, mango, pear, and peach.Research rabbit food before giving it to them, as some food or some part of the food may be dangerous to its health (apples are great, but their seeds contain tiny amounts of cyanide which is harmful). Unlike some rabbit breeds (such as the Angora), the Mini Satin rabbit is not susceptible to any particular health issues like Wool block. They do require regular checking in its ears (for mites), its coat and backside (for flystrike), and its teeth (for overgrown teeth). Overgrown teeth can protrude into your rabbit\u2019s face and jaw and be very painful. Symptoms include a loss of appetite, droppings and overall less movement from your rabbit. A diet that is high in hay (70 percent is ideal) should be enough to prevent this painful condition, as hay naturally files down a rabbit\u2019s ever-growing teeth. When a rabbit\u2019s coat is soiled with feces or urine, flies may like to call your rabbit\u2019s bottom their home. Flies lay eggs in the fur and once the eggs have hatched, they will burrow into your rabbit. If you believe your rabbit may have contracted flystrike, take it to your local veterinarian immediately for treatment. Bucks can be neutered when they are young as 3 1/2 months old while does should wait until they are 4-6 months old before being spayed. Like the standard Satin rabbit, the Mini Satin\u2019s coat has beautiful, shiny fur that is very appealing. Generally, the Mini Satin rabbit is gentle and calm; however if it is not used to the human that it is interacting with, it may be a little bit skittish and/or snippy.

A breeder named Jane Bramley combined the Lionhead Rabbit with a Mini Lop Rabbit to produce this uniquely beautiful breed. Jane\u2019s breeding technique worked because the mutation that\u2019s responsible for giving the Lionhead Rabbit its lovely mane and bib is caused by a dominant gene. In other words, when you breed a purebred Lionhead Rabbit with another breed, the offspring will feature that mane and bib. Therefore, the Mini Lion Lop can be produced by crossing the Lionhead Rabbit with a Mini Lop, with a Lionhead/Mini Lop hybrid, and with Dwarf Lops, which would result in the Dwarf Lion Lop Rabbit. In 2006, this breed was accepted by the British Rabbit Council (BRC). It has been championed in the UK by Jane Bramley, who has worked on achieving recognition for these adorable pets. The breed is not yet recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). The Miniature Lion Lop is a new breed from the UK. Overall, the Miniature Lion Lop is similar to the Mini Lop, but there are some distinctive characteristics that make it stand out, one of which is the Lionhead Rabbit mane, as well as the area of the chest that features more fur. This is why it can also be considered a mini version of the Lionhead Rabbit. This small rabbit\u2019s body can be described as strong, firm, well muscled, thickset, broad, and short. The back legs are described as stocky, short, powerful, and carried parallel with the rest of the body. The haunches are well rounded and the rump is short. The front legs should be straight and short. The chest should be deep and broad, and there should be curved sides where the chest meets the rabbit\u2019s shoulders, which are strong and broad as well. The tail should be well furred and straight, and there can also be a small dewlap in adult females. The head should be wide and have a curvy profile, and there should be a noticeable width in between the animal\u2019s eyes. You will also notice a broad muzzle, full cheeks, and eyes that are large, bright, and bold. The neck is not entirely visible. The wide ears should hang down on the sides of the head, and they should be carried close to the cheeks. Also, the basal ridge of the rabbit\u2019s ears will be prominent across the top of the head. The ears should be well furred, thick, rounded at the ends, and broad. And the insides of the ears shouldn\u2019t be visible when looking at the animal from any angle. The coat of a Miniature Lion Lop will be medium in length, as well as soft and dense with roll back and a lot of guard hairs. There will also be a longer mane that is around 2-3\u201d long, and it should circle the head. Also, the mane should create the shape of a \u201cV\u201d behind the rabbit\u2019s neck, while falling over the head between the animal\u2019s ears. Some rabbits can even be double-maned. The pads and legs of the Mini Lion Lop should also be well furred, and there could be a bit of extended fur surrounding the flanks. There are many colors that this beautiful little rabbit can feature, even though it was originally bred to only showcase a few specific colors. The main colors for the Miniature Lion Lop include steel, opal, iron gray, blue, beige, chocolate, seal point, blue point, smoke, sable (including light, medium, and dark Siamese sable), Siamese smoke, black fox, black otter, butterfly, orange, fawn, sooty fawn, white with red or blue eyes, agouti, and black. Mini Lion Lops enjoy exploring, being social, and playing. Your Mini Lion Lop should have the opportunity to spend some time exploring the great outdoors, whether you decide to let him live indoors or outside. When housing a Mini Lion Lop outside, make sure the hutch is large enough for your pet to hop around, stand up on his hind legs, and turn around comfortably. The enclosure should be kept out of direct wind and sun, and it should be totally waterproof and weatherproof, as well as protected from predators. When housed indoors, you can train your pet to use a litter tray, and you should also provide him with a safe and quiet place where he can relax and be alone if he wants to, such as a dog crate. Rabbit-proof your home to ensure your belongings, including wires and cables, will not be chewed on, and give your rabbit room to run around and play safely. Whether your Miniature Lion Lop lives indoors or in your garden, you will need to give him access to a big exercise area, particularly in the early morning and late evening, when his energy will be highest. In terms of diet, you can provide your pet with high quality hays, rabbit pellets, and plenty of fibrous veggies and leafy greens. Always provide clean water too. As would be the case with any other rabbit breed, you will need to check your pet\u2019s teeth regularly to ensure he is not developing any dental issues like overgrown teeth. Providing your Mini Lion Lop with a fibrous diet and gnaw toys will help prevent problems. Feed your pet the appropriate diet to also help your rabbit maintain a healthy weight, as overweight animals find it difficult to groom themselves thoroughly. In addition to the fur becoming soiled, overweight rabbits could become vulnerable to flystrike. Talk to your vet about having your pet vaccinated, as well as treated for worms, ticks, and fleas. You can also have your rabbit spayed or neutered. Miniature Lion Lops are considered friendly and even-tempered. In terms of their personality, Miniature Lion Lops are considered friendly and even-tempered. They can also be active and lively, and they enjoy being around their human family, getting plenty of attention and having fun by playing. However, the breed is still being developed, so the temperaments of these rabbits can vary. You should let your rabbit explore, and you should provide him with a variety of toys, such as noisy cat toys and boxes. And if you have the room for more than one Mini Lion Lop, these rabbits enjoy being social with one another, so you will find them playing with each other and grooming each other.", "facts": " Compact Rabbit owners of all experience levels Friendly, social, even-tempered, lively, active", "tags": "lion lop, lionhead rabbit, lop rabbit, mini lop, Miniature Lion Lop, miniature lop, rabbit, rabbit breed, "}, "netherland dwarf rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/netherland-dwarf-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/netherland-dwarf-rabbit-668x445.jpg", "name": "Netherland Dwarf Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Netherland Dwarf rabbit saw its first steps in Holland when a group of five men, led by Jan Meyering, worked for 30 years to develop a standardized small rabbit that would be accepted and available in a variety of colors. To create this breed, they bred all-white Hermelin rabbits with local native rabbits, as well as many other domestic breeds both small and large. The Netherland Dwarf rabbit was recognized by Holland in 1940. A mere 17 Netherland Dwarf rabbits survived World War II and in 1947, several English breeders were given 9 offspring in a few colors and shades. In 1950, the British Rabbit Council recognized the new breed. Finally, this rabbit breed arrived in the United States 15 years later in 1965, its purpose to breed and improve Polish rabbits in the United States. The American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) accepted the Netherland Dwarf rabbit as a recognized breed in 1969 and today, it is one of the most popular rabbit breed in the world. The Netherland Dwarf rabbit is one of the most popular rabbit breed in the world. Netherland Dwarf rabbits have rather large eyes compared to the rest of its compact body, which makes for a cute rabbit. They have short, small ears carried high on their head and their face is round and short. They reach an adult weight of 2.5 lbs, which makes them look like a kit for the rest of their lives. A Netherland Dwarf\u2019s coat is not particularly difficult to maintain. It is short to medium in length, soft, and does not need much grooming to keep it in shape. Should you find that your rabbit is shedding more than usual, this may be due to the time of the year (shedding season). If you wish to brush your rabbit during this time so there is less fur in the house, use a bristled brush and stroke in the natural direction of its fur. Remember that rabbits should never be bathed, as this causes them great stress and may cause cardiac problems. If your rabbit\u2019s fur is dirty, simply clean it with a damp cloth. The Netherland Dwarf rabbit has many colors that are accepted by the ARBA. This includes Chinchilla, Tortoise Shell, Sable Point, Black Silver Marten,  Blue Tan, Orange,  Chocolate Himalayan, and  more. There is no particular markings on this rabbit that makes this breed stand out from any other small/dwarf breed. A Netherland Dwarf rabbit\u2019s coat is short to medium in length, soft, and does not need much grooming. A proper diet is probably one of the most important aspects of rabbit ownership. Two things should be given in unlimited amounts to ensure your rabbit is well fed and their health is maintained: fresh water and good-quality hay. Pellets, fresh fruits/vegetables and leafy greens should only make up 25 percent of its diet (or even given as occasional treats). Some rabbit-safe vegetables include carrots, fennel, broccoli, and cucumbers, and as for fruits, try to only serve your rabbit fruits that are low in sugar (such as apples). The Netherland Dwarf rabbit is a small rabbit (one of the smallest of the dwarf varieties), and so their enclosure does not have to be large to keep them content. Because of its small size, we recommend this rabbit be kept indoors to keep them safe from predators and the elements. Cages should be made of wire and have a plastic bottom in order to line it with bedding. Bedding should be spot-cleaned every day to rid it of feces and needs to be completely replaced at the end of every week. Should you wish to raise a well-socialized rabbit who enjoys human interaction, you must take this rabbit out of its enclosure and have regular playtime. These little rabbits may look adorable and fun, but they have a natural disposition to be a little on the shy side and will jump right out of your hand if s/he does not take to you. The more often they are outdoors being held, petted and simply being around humans, they more likely you will have a rabbit who enjoys your presence and who actually wants to be with you. With lots of playtime and patience, the Netherland Dwarf will easily befriend you. Netherland Dwarf rabbits tend to be more at-risk to develop malocclusion. Malocclusion occurs when a rabbit has a growth spurt but the jaw and mandible don\u2019t grow at the same rate. Consequently, the bottom incisors protrude from the upper incisors, which means they won\u2019t connect with each other while chewing. Teeth will be unable to naturally be worn down and they grow out to control.  Overgrown teeth can be a problem in other rabbits if their diet does not mainly consist of hay. If this does happen, malocclusion can be corrected with a trip to your local vet, where they trim your rabbit\u2019s teeth. Rabbits can be spayed/neutered for purposes of aggression. Bucks can be neutered as young as 3.5 months old, while does should wait until they are 4-6 months old before being spayed. Spayed/neutered rabbits tend to live longer than those who are not fixed. Netherland Dwarf rabbits can be shy and slightly skittish. Unlike other mini/dwarf rabbits who enjoy human presence, letting your Netherland Dwarf rabbit know that you mean no harm can be a little bit of a learning curve. Because of their naturally shy and slightly skittish disposition, we don\u2019t recommend this rabbit for families who have young children, as they can easily be dropped and get hurt if they are far  off the ground. Socialize these rabbits at a young age and offer plenty of human interaction \u2013 their shy nature should diminish and you\u2019ll have an adorably energetic rabbit who enjoys the company of their human handlers. They are also great little bunnies for couples, singles or seniors who live in either a home or apartment. Another learning curve is litter training. Like most rabbits, potty training them is arguably more difficult than teaching a dog/cat, but not impossible. Most rabbits \u201cgo\u201d in a particular corner in their cage so it won\u2019t be too hard to find out where they\u2019d rather \u201cgo\u201d in your home. Many rabbit owners have found success by placing several rabbit litter boxes around the house so they don\u2019t have to hop all the way to their cage in order to do the deed. With lots of time, patience and rewards, it is very much possible to train these little bundles of fur where to do their business. Pet rabbits who are out of their enclosures generally need some toys to keep them occupied. This can be as simple as a few rolls of empty toilet papers rolls they can chew up. It all depends on your rabbit\u2019s personality and what they personally like to play with. As with any pet, be sure you rabbit-proof your room.", "facts": " Compact Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors, Apartment/House Rabbits, Families with older children, Indoor rabbits Skittish, quiet, shy, sweet", "tags": "malocclusion, Netherland Dwarf, short ears, "}, "new zealand rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/new-zealand-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/new-zealand-white-rabbit.jpg", "name": "New Zealand Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Although their name suggests it, these rabbits are not actually from New Zealand. In fact, they are the first American rabbit breed to be developed. At the beginning of the 20th century, American breeders crossed the popular rabbit types from the \u2018old country\u2019 in hopes to develop a meat-producing, show quality rabbit. By 1913, their crosses with genes of Belgian Hares and Flemish Giants were gaining popularity under the name of New Zealand Red Rabbit. Soon after, the albino sports of the breed were developed separately. The first litter of what will become New Zealand White rabbits were born in 1917 when a New Zealand Red doe had four albino kits. The striking beauty of these pure white sports with crimson eyes prompted the breeder to try and replicate them through selective breeding. After this, the rest is history. New Zealand Rabbits became very popular all across the United States. Many breeders tried to improve upon their qualities or selectively breed them for different purposes. Today, there are 5 distinct New Zealand Rabbit breeds that are recognized by ARBA. New Zealand Reds were recognized in 1916, New Zealand White Rabbit in 1920 and Black New Zealands in 1958. The newest additions to the breed are the broken variety, which was accepted by ARBA in 2010 and the blue variety which had the same luck in late 2016. New Zealand Rabbits are large, muscular animals that have a beautiful coat. The New Zealand has a rather well-rounded commercial body shape, which is slender yet muscular. This breed was primarily developed for the production of meat and their appearance shows it. From hips to loins to ribs, the New Zealand rabbit is a well-filled animal. Their head is moderately rounded, and in proportion with the rest of their body. Ears are thick, well-furred with rounded tips and carried erect. Does are bigger than bucks with a maximum weight of 10 to 12 pounds, where the male of the breed is supposed to weigh between 9 and 11 pounds.   New Zealand rabbits have short, soft flyback fur that is set tightly in the pelt. Their coat does not need much grooming (as rabbits are generally clean animals), however, should you keep your New Zealand as a pet, you may find grooming them from time to time will reduce the amount of loose hair in your home. To boot, this will make sure your pet doesn\u2019t ingest a lot of their own hair during self-grooming which can be dangerous for their health.  Grooming them once every week or biweekly with a bristled brush should do the trick. Always remember that rabbits should not be bathed, as this causes them great stress and may cause cardiac problems. Instead, spot-clean any dirty areas with a damp cloth. The New Zealand rabbit has five colors that is recognized by the ARBA. These are red, white, black, blue, and broken, the latter being any color mixed with white. Each of the coat colors belongs to a separate variety of the breed.  New Zealand rabbits enjoy being handled and are rather easy-going. Like all rabbits, New Zealands need an adequate enclosure to eat, sleep, etc. Outdoor enclosures should be raised and have enough space for the rabbit to stretch their legs comfortably, hop about and sit up. Considering this rabbit\u2019s size, their habitat needs to be rather large. As a rule of thumb, any New Zealand Rabbit will need an enclosure that\u2019s 30\u201d by 36\u201d. Indoor rabbit enclosures should be made of sturdy wire all around, have a plastic or metal bottom and be large enough for the New Zealand rabbit to stretch out, just like outdoor enclosures. The bottom of their cages should be covered in rabbit-safe bedding, and it needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. Hay, wood pellets, shredded paper, and sawdust are some of the most common choices for rabbit cage bedding.  In addition to spending time inside their spacious and comfortable enclosure, rabbits will also need to be let out to play on a regular basis. However, before you let your pet out, you need to bunny-proof the space they are going to be in. Indoors, remove any toxic house plants or foods your rabbit could get to, hide electric cables and protect wooden furniture legs your bunny will try to gnaw at. Outside, make them a pen that will keep them in a safe area, away from predators and without means to wander off. In both cases, you will have to supervise your bunny. A New Zealand rabbit\u2019s diet is no different than any other rabbit diet in that it should consist mainly of high-quality hay. Most rabbit owners agree that timothy hay is the best bang for your buck, but orchard hay is also acceptable and the occasional alfalfa grass is also beneficial. The rest of the diet should be a good balance of fruits, leafy greens, vegetables, and pellets. Like hay, there are plenty types of pellets available on the market, some with higher protein content than others.   Be aware of what kind of fruits, leafy greens, and vegetables you have in your home as some are rabbit-safe and others are not. In fact, most leafy greens are unsafe as they can cause digestive issues, especially if you feed your rabbit a large amount of it. Feed your rabbit greens that are high in fiber and nutrients, such as romaine lettuce, and be aware of what kind of fruits you\u2019re feeding (apples are a wonderful choice).  Thankfully, the New Zealand rabbit is not susceptible to any particular disease or health problems, however there are some things potential rabbit owners need to watch out for. Overgrown teeth, for example, is a common problem in pet rabbits which is mostly diet-related. Rabbits must have a diet high in hay, as the hay is responsible for keeping their teeth at a manageable length (unlike cats and dogs, a rabbit\u2019s teeth never stops growing throughout its life). Should your rabbit\u2019s teeth overgrow, they may grow into their jaw and face, causing immense pain. Make sure to take a peek inside your bunny\u2019s mouth about once every week or so to make sure this is not a problem. De-worming paste is also a must for indoor or outdoor rabbits to keep them worm-free. A pea-sized amount twice a year should be sufficient. Indoor/outdoor New Zealand rabbit owners should also check its ears weekly, as ear mites can develop. There is a also painful condition called flystrike that can occur (mostly with outdoor rabbits) that happens when flies lay their eggs in soiled fur (mostly around their bottoms). Once the eggs hatch, their main source of nutrition is your rabbit\u2019s insides and this causes them excruciating pain.  Should you suspect your rabbit is suffering from flystrike, take them to your local veterinarian immediately to get treated. Bucks can be neutered as young as three and a half months old while does should wait until they are six months old to be spayed. The New Zealanders are docile and calm rabbits to start with, so the main benefit of fixing them is not to minimize aggressiveness. If your rabbit is not going to be used for breeding, sterilization has other important consequences besides preventing your pets to produce more rabbits. Neutered males are less likely to mark with urine and females will have a lower risk of getting uterine cancer.  The New Zealand rabbit is great as a pet \u2013 it is generally good with children and other pets. Because the New Zealand rabbit was developed to be meat/fur producers, they are generally docile and easy to handle. However, should you decide to keep a New Zealand as a pet, they are generally good with children and other pets so long as they are given time to properly socialize at a young age. They enjoy being handled and are rather easy-going, which makes them a great family pet for couples who have younger or older children. These bunnies are also calm and friendly, making them great starter pets as well for singles, couples or seniors who are looking for a furry companion to keep them company. This breed of rabbit is not known to bite, kick or be overall aggressive and loves to be picked up or held on laps while they are petted and loved \u2013 they are even sometimes called \u201crag dolls\u201d because they flop like a actual rag doll wherever you set them down. While they are not known to bite, all rabbits should be given a few toys they can happily chew, nibble and gnaw in order to reduce boredom and possible keep their teeth nice and short. Depending on your rabbit\u2019s personality, this can be as simple as an empty rule of kitchen paper towels to as complex as a mental stimulation pet toy from your local pet store. While not the easiest indoor pet to train, it is indeed possible to litter train a rabbit. Many owners find having several litter boxes spread across the home is a necessary evil in order for their indoor rabbit not to leave their droppings all over their home. They also find that if their rabbit is prone to doing the deed in one particular corner, they place a litter box in that corner so the rabbit can make the connection and understand that they should be doing their business in the box. With lots of time, patience and a few treats, litter training should be successful within a few months.", "facts": " Commercial Rabbits for Singles,  Rabbit for Seniors, Apartment/House Rabbits, Families with children, First-time owners, Indoor/Outdoor Rabbits Affectionate, even-tempered, quiet, docile", "tags": "family-friendly rabbits, flyback fur, new zealand rabbit, Overgrown teeth, pet rabbits for kids, pet rabbits for seniors, "}, "new zealand red rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/new-zealand-red-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/new-zealand-red-rabbit.jpg", "name": "New Zealand Red Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Although the name may not suggest it, New Zealand Red rabbit originates from the United States. First selected in 1910 in California, these showy rabbits were meant to be a commercial breed and were bred for their fur and meat. Thankfully, this is not the case anymore: these stunning red rabbits are now treasured as pets. The exact combination of breeds that were used to create New Zealand Red rabbit is unknown, but some experts think the now extinct Golden Fawn breed is the key to the breed\u2019s genesis. The sources claim that Golden Fawns (Flemish Giant and Belgian Hare hybrids) were bred with Belgian Hares to achieve the spectacular ginger fur. The British Rabbit Society recognizes The New Zealand Red rabbit as a separate breed, while ARBA perceives it as a color variant of the New Zealand Rabbit breed. Best known for their vivid ginger coat and great personality, New Zealand Red rabbits make wonderful family pets. The New Zealand Red rabbits weigh between 6.5 to 10 lbs and are considered to be a large breed. They are sturdy and thickly built, with a semi-arched body shape, which may be their main difference from the commercial shaped New Zealand Rabbits- apart from the distinct color of their coat. Their long, upright ears are in proportion with the rest of their body and the rounded head. The short, flyback fur of New Zealand Red rabbits makes them exceptionally undemanding when it comes to grooming. Their hair is of normal type and not too fine, so brushing won\u2019t be a chore: going through their coat with a brush once a week will be more than enough to keep these bunnies neat and tidy. Of course, as all rabbit breeds, New Zealand Red rabbits will shed more during the molting season and will require more frequent grooming during that period. Although not exceptionally silky and soft, the fur of these rabbits is not coarse or rough to the touch- petting them feels lovely! The name New Zealand Red clearly states what color these rabbits come in: only red pigmentation of the coat is allowed for this breed. And it\u2019s not a dull pale reddish brown, either. These rabbits flaunt a spectacular coat color of deep, vibrant cinnamon-red hue, without any patterns or markings. Their bellies are creamy beige, and they have brown eyes. These rabbits are affectionate, social, and love being handled by their owners. New Zealand Red rabbits can be kept both indoors and outdoors, but if you plan on getting them as a pet, it\u2019s better to have them share a home with you. That way, their lovely personality can truly shine through, and they can get the chance to develop a meaningful bond with you and members of your family. However, an adequate cage for the bunny is mandatory, regardless of where you decide to keep them, as it will serve as a safe haven and a cozy retreat for your pet. The enclosure should provide the rabbit with enough space to comfortably move around, sit, and stretch his hind legs. Though rabbits need to have their own enclosure where they can safely play and rest, it doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be let outside regularly. Ideally, your bunny should have regular access to the outdoors where they could enjoy some supervised playtime and get the chance to roam about and explore. You should never leave your rabbit unattended when they\u2019re out of the cage, though: even if they don\u2019t get lost or attacked by a predator, rabbits can hurt themselves by nibbling on something they shouldn\u2019t, like electric cables or toxic foods. Their diet is no different than that of any other pet rabbit- New Zealand Reds will thrive if their meals are based primarily on hay and high-quality rabbit pellets. Of course, a variety of veggies and fruits, such as carrots, lettuce, or strawberries, should be given both as a vitamin boost and as a yummy treat. New Zealand Red rabbits are generally considered to be a healthy and robust breed, and they don\u2019t have any breed-specific diseases or hereditary conditions you should be aware of. But, when it comes to health issues that are common to all rabbit breeds, you should pay attention to early warning signs that something is wrong with your pet rabbit. For example, poop connected by strands of hair or constipation can signal that your pet has hairballs that caused an intestinal blockage (commonly known as GI stasis). Thankfully, this, as well as most other rabbit health issues, is completely preventable. Regularly groom your pet and provide plenty of hay in their diet: not only it will keep their digestive tract healthy, but it will also help them grind down their teeth. In general, lack of appetite, apathy or sudden mood and personality changes tend to signify an underlying medical condition, so it\u2019s best to contact a vet if you notice any of these symptoms in your bunny. Smart and easy-going, The New Zealand Red Rabbit is an ideal choice for first-time owners. Easy-going and friendly, New Zealand Red rabbits make excellent family pets. These sweet-natured bunnies don\u2019t mind being handled and enjoy cuddles and petting. They are also a great choice if you have children or other pets in your household: as long as they are well-mannered and respectful, New Zealand Red won\u2019t mind the interaction. These pretty-looking rabbits can be successfully litter trained, provided that you have the patience to teach them and start the training at an early age. New Zealand Reds are a smart breed and will pick up on what you teach them if you are persistent!

He crossed several commercial-typed rabbits in the late 1940s and eventually made way for a rabbit he called \u201cTawnies.\u201d He enlisted the help of a few other breeders and together, they developed their brightly colored tawnies into a new breed and obtained an American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association\u2019s (ARBA) working standard under the name \u201cWashingtonian.\u201d The new rabbit breed was presented in an ARBA convention in 1953, where the name was changed to Palomino and in 1957, the Palomino Rabbit was officially recognized by the ARBA. The Palomino rabbit needs plenty of time outside of its enclosure to explore and thrive. The Palomino rabbit weighs anywhere from 8-10 lbs once fully grown and has a commercial style body type. It has a well-rounded hind quarters, firm flesh, have large, upright ears and brown eyes. This rabbit has coarse, short to medium rollback fur which does not require much maintenance in order to keep it show-worthy. During off-seasons shedding times, bi-weekly grooming sessions are perfectly acceptable. During the spring, owners may want to increase the number of brushings depending on how much the rabbit\u2019s shed. Once to twice per week should be plenty during these molting periods. The only two colors accepted by the ARBA is lynx, the latter being the most popular.  The golden color is an orange/beige cream color with white undercoat while the lynx variety has a silver or gray surface color blending to a beige/orange or white/cream coat. The Palomino rabbit makes a wonderful first-time pet. In order to see its personality blossom, the Palomino rabbit needs plenty of time outside of its enclosure to explore and form a lasting bond with its human family. This particular breed does well either in indoor or outdoor enclosures, as its coat is dense and coarse enough to handle cold temperatures (even with snow), so long as its outdoor enclosure is protected from the elements (sun, rain, snow). Outdoor enclosures should also be covered on three sides to protect rabbits from cold drafts in the winter, as well as provide ventilation and shade at the same time during the hotter months. Indoor enclosures should be made of wire and have a solid bottom in order to lay down rabbit-safe bedding (horse bedding is acceptable as well). Bedding should be spot-cleaned everyday to keep it sanitary and needs to be completely replaced at the end of every week. As with any rabbit, the Palomino\u2019s consists of 70 percent high-quality hay (such as orchard hay), with the rest being a healthy mixture of leafy greens, pellets, fruits and vegetables. Adult rabbits can eat about 1/4 cup of high-fiber pellets everyday for every 5 lbs. it weighs. Always make sure to research what kind of fruit/leafy green/vegetable you\u2019re planning on feeding them, as some are not recommended for rabbits and others contain high levels of sugar and are better left as treats. Due to the Palomino\u2019s short, coarse coat, it is not at-risk for digestive issues such as woodblock. It is still susceptible to other problems such as overgrown teeth, flystrike and ear mites. Owners need to check the Palomino rabbit ears every 2-3 weeks for the latter and if your rabbit\u2019s diet does not consist mainly of hay, it may develop overgrown teeth. This will affect if/how much they eat, as its constantly growing teeth can grow into its jaw, and be painful. This can be corrected with a quick trip to your vet at first, and then switch to a diet that is higher in hay, as it naturally grinds down your rabbit\u2019s teeth. Female rabbits (called does) can be spayed when they are as young as four months old, however vets tend to wait until they are six months old. Male rabbits (called bucks) are eligible to be neutered as young as three and a half months old. All rabbits should also be given worm prevention treatment and checked for ticks and fleas regularly. The Palomino Rabbit has coarse, short to medium rollback fur, which does not require much maintenance. Palominos love to be out of its enclosure and into the world. Due to its gentle nature, it does well with children so long as it is handled carefully and has enough time out of its enclosure to become social animals. If it spends too much time in its enclosure, it will become depressed and/or bored, especially if it has no companion rabbit. The Palomino Rabbit is a wonderful first-time pet, as it is relatively low maintenance so long as you provide it with essential items to keep it safe, healthy and happy. Because it is a sociable animal, these rabbits are also good pets for couples and seniors, so long as retirees are able to physically to tend to the rabbit\u2019s needs. Rabbits are harder to litter train than other animals, however it is possible with lots of patience, perseverance and plenty of treats. Many rabbit owners will have 5 or 6 litter boxes scattered across their home so their rabbit can easily access do the deed wherever it pleases. Having said that, don\u2019t be alarmed if potty training your rabbit takes a few months\u2026 it may be a lengthy process, but it\u2019s well worth the end result. Be sure to provide your Palomino rabbit with a few bunny-safe toys. Rabbits have different personalities and can be picky with its toys. Some rabbits are content with just some cardboard or a discarded piece of wood while others require elaborate toys that mentally stimulate.

Devie D\u2019anniballe is credited with creating the Miniature Plush Lop in the United States, starting in 1995. She was able to develop this breed by crossing the Miniature Lop, the Miniature Rex, and the Holland Lop. Her goal was to breed a pet rabbit that would showcase a combination of all of the positive qualities of those breeds, while at the same time breeding out any problems that were associated with them. D\u2019anniballe ended up creating a new breed that featured a compact body, lopped ears, and hypoallergenic Rex fur. This new breed also has a wonderful personality, as these rabbits are friendly, adventurous, outgoing, affectionate, and playful, as well as docile and tolerable of being held. The Standard Plush Lop was developed later, in 2002, by Christine Toyer in Australia. She crossed the Standard Rex with the Dwarf Lop, creating a breed that combined the short and velvety coat of the Rex with the endearing personality of the Lop Rabbit. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the Plush Lop Rabbit is still considered in development. The Plush Lop is a newer breed that can be divided into the standard size and the mini size. The body of the Standard Plush Lop should be compact and firm, and it should feature well rounded loins, a deep and broad chest, and wide shoulders. Overall, the rabbit should have a well muscled and strong appearance. The hindquarters and the shoulders should be about the same in terms of width, and the head, which is well developed and bold, should be set well on the animal\u2019s shoulders. There will be little visible neck, and there should be a good width in between the eyes, which are large, bright, round, and bold. You\u2019ll also note a broad muzzle and full cheeks, and the basal ridge of the animal\u2019s ears should be prominent across the top of the head. Also, the hind legs will be strong, short, and parallel with the body, while the front legs will be straight, short, and strong. The rabbit\u2019s tail should be well furred and straight. A small dewlap can be found on the females. The ears should be well furred, rounded, thick, and broad, as well as carried close to the cheeks. They should also hang down straight behind the rabbit\u2019s eyes, and they should not point backwards or forwards. The insides of the ears shouldn\u2019t be visible. The overall appearance of the Miniature Plush Lop is similar to that of the Standard variety. The body should be compact, thickset, firm, and bold, as well as cobby, well muscled, and short. The head, which has a rounded profile, should be broad and bold and feature well developed, full cheeks, and it should be set well into the rabbit\u2019s shoulders. The muzzle should be broad, the basal ridge of the rabbit\u2019s ears should be prominent, and there should be a good width between the eyes. There should also be little visible neck, and the rump should be well rounded, well muscled, and short. Also, the chest should be deep and broad and feature curved sides where the chest meets the shoulders, which are strong and broad. The front legs should be straight, short, and thick, while the hind legs should be strong, carried parallel with the body, and short. The tail should be well furred, strong, and straight, and a small dewlap may also be noted. A Mini Plush Lop will have ears that are well furred, rounded, thick, and broad, and they should be carried close to the animal\u2019s cheeks, straight down behind the eyes, not pointing backwards or forwards. The insides of the ears shouldn\u2019t be visible. The eyes should be large, bright, round, and bold as well. For the Standard and the Mini, the soft coat of the Plush Lop should be about \u00bd inch in length, and it should feature a fine and silky texture that is free from wooliness. There should be good density, and it should be level and smooth over the whole body. There should also be a lustrous sheen, and the fur should be plush and firm without any projecting guard hairs. The Plush Lop also does not shed excessively, but will molt two times a year. The Standard and Mini Plush Lop can feature any pattern or color that\u2019s accepted by the British Rabbit Council (BRC), except the broken pattern. The coat of a Plush Lop is smooth, soft, and silky. The Plush Lop does better when housed indoors, though you do have the option of keeping your pet outside if you provide him with a large enough enclosure that is safe from predators and the elements. Indoors, you can give your rabbit a cage to use as a place to retreat and rest when he\u2019s not playing and exploring. Always provide your rabbit with plenty of fresh, clean water. In terms of diet, rabbits do well on a variety of high quality hays, as well as rabbit pellets and plenty of vegetables, including leafy greens. Like other rabbit breeds, the Plush Lop might develop dental problems, particularly if his diet is lacking in fibrous vegetables and he isn\u2019t provided with gnaw toys that will keep the teeth at the appropriate length. You can talk to your vet about having your pet treated for ticks, worms, and fleas, especially if he\u2019ll be spending any time in your garden. Your vet can also discuss the option of having your pet spayed or neutered, as well as vaccinated. Always feed your rabbit a healthy diet that will allow him to maintain an ideal weight, as overweight rabbits have a hard time grooming themselves and become vulnerable to flystrike. The Plush Lop has a friendly and docile personality. The Plush Lop makes a fantastic family pet because it\u2019s known for its sweet and docile personality. These rabbits will be happy when sitting in your lap and relaxing, but they\u2019ll also hop around the house with curiosity. Plus, they enjoy playing, so you can provide your pet with a variety of toys, and they get along well with children because they are gentle.", "facts": " Compact Rabbit owners of all experience levels Friendly, adventurous, outgoing, affectionate, playful, docile", "tags": "dwarf lop rabbit, lop breed, lop rabbit, lop rabbit breed, mini lop rabbit, Miniature Lop Rabbit, miniature plush lop, Miniature Rex Rabbit, plush lop, rabbit, rabbit breed, Rex, rex lop, rex rabbit, standard plush lop rabbit, "}, "polish rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/polish-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/polish-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Polish Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "Despite its name, the Polish Rabbit breed has its origin in England and it may have been offspring of an albino Dutch rabbit. In the early 1800s, a few white rabbits of small sized (and probably mixed origins) popped up in England and breeders began calling them \u201cPolish\u201d (we will never know why they decided to call them by this name).  It is thought that it was developed by breeding a Dutch and Himalayan rabbit dating back to the 1600s. By the 1900s, they were one of the most popular meat breeds in Europe, especially in Belgium. These rabbits eventually made their way to America around 1912 and were used to source other breeds, such as the Netherland Dwarf. Soon after, the Polish Rabbit was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). The Polish Rabbit has a short head with full cheeks, large eyes and short ears. This rabbit breed has a short head with full cheeks, large eyes and short ears which point and touch each other all the way to the tip. They have a compact body shape and carry the dwarf gene, meaning they should not weigh more than 3.5 lbs. The Polish rabbit has short, soft, flyback fur that is easy to maintain in comparison to other breeds, which have longer wool (Angoras, for instance). To keep it maintained, you should groom your rabbit once a week or biweekly. During the spring or when they start to shed, you may want/need to increase your grooming to twice a week in order to keep your house fur-free. There are six varieties of Polish rabbit coat color/markings that are accepted by the ARBA. They are: Ruby-Eyed White (REW), Black, Blue, Chocolate, Blue-Eyed White (BEW) and Broken pattern (which is any color mixed with white). Polish rabbits love attention and will happily let you  pick them up. These rabbits do not need a large enclosure, as they are small in size. Having said that, we do recommend this breed stay indoors because of their small size (it makes them easy targets for predators such as racoons and coyotes). Your indoor rabbit enclosure should be made of wire, be large enough for your rabbit to comfortably stretch out and have a plastic/metal bottom that\u2019s covered in comfortable bedding (horse bedding works well). The bedding needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced every week. A Polish rabbit\u2019s diet is like any other rabbits in that it should consist mainly of hay (70 percent), while the rest should be a healthy balance of pellets, leafy greens, fruits, and vegetables. Research what kind of fruits, vegetables and greens are rabbit-friendly \u2013 if you\u2019re not sure if a particular food can be eaten, the rule of thumb is simply not to give it to them. Limit the amount of fruits that are high in sugar, and make sure to stay clear of iceberg lettuce, as it contains too much water and too little fiber to count as a good meal. Do not feed your rabbit yard clippings as grass can be treated with fertilizer, insecticides, pesticides, and other chemicals that can harm your rabbit. Polish rabbits are not particularly susceptible to any specific hereditary disease, however there are many common problems that can occur. Cages should always be made of galvanized steel and should have a separate part where droppings will not get caught in their fur, or else problems such as flystrike can occur. Flystrike is an extremely painful condition that can often leave your bunny immobilized in agony or even result in death if their cages are not properly tended after. Two other common rabbit conditions are ear mites and overgrown teeth. Be sure to check your rabbit\u2019s ears for signs of ear mites (more common with rabbits with have larger ears). Check your rabbit\u2019s mouth at least once every other week to make sure their teeth are an appropriate size. A diet high in hay will make sure that their teeth are properly shaven down (hay does this naturally), but if you find your rabbit\u2019s teeth are still growing out of control, a rabbit-safe block of wood they can chew on is sufficient to keep them at a reasonable length. Otherwise, teeth that are growing into your rabbit\u2019s jaw or face need to be taken care of by a veterinarian. A Polish rabbit\u2019s docile, affectionate nature makes it a wonderful pet for singles, couples, seniors, or families. Most believe that smaller rabbits are best suited for families with young children, as the rabbit is still small, cuddly and adorable well into its adult years. However, the smaller the rabbit, the easier it is for children to drop them and accidentally hurt them, so we do not recommend this rabbit breed for small children despite their excellent disposition. Their docile, affectionate nature is wonderful for singles, couples, seniors or for families with children old enough to understand how delicate rabbits are. These rabbits love attention and will happily be picked up, held and petted by their human companions. Their small size makes them a great pet for those living in small apartments. Providing some toys for your rabbit to chew and play with is also a good idea, because your rabbit may entertain itself in other ways (your personal property may be their first culprit). These small rabbits are slightly more trainable than larger ones \u2013 magicians, for example, often use these small rabbits as part of their show. While teaching your Polish rabbit how to pop out of an \u201cempty\u201d top hat may not be your top priority, teaching them how to stay, come and litter training them would be useful. Teaching rabbits how to perform tricks and training is not as easy as teaching a dog or cat, but it is possible with time, patience and rewards.", "facts": " Compact Rabbits for Singles, Rabbit for Seniors,Apartment /House Rabbits, Families with older children, First-time owners, Indoor Rabbits Calm, docile, friendly", "tags": "apartment rabbits, dwarf rabbit breeds, flyback fur, indoor rabbits, polish rabbit, rabbits for seniors, "}, "rex rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/rex-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rex-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Rex Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Rex Rabbit wasn\u2019t born yesterday, ya know! This is an illustrious little bunny with quite a rich history worth exploring. The Rex Rabbit was developed around 1919 in the French village of Louch\u00e9-Pring\u00e9, by breeders who were impressed by this wild rabbit\u2019s beautiful and luscious fur. This stunning breed was developed from a litter of wild gray rabbits. They were selectively bred into a domestic breed and shown in an international rabbit show in Paris in 1924, where there was great interest among breeders because of the recessive rex gene. These rabbits may have been found int the wild initially, but they quickly exploded in popularity and became coveted as pets. Following its first showing in Paris, the breed was introduced to the United States that same year and was shown by American rabbit breeder John C. Fehr and his partner Alfred Zimmerman. The breed was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) soon after. It\u2019s been a stable in the homes of rabbit lovers ever since. To see a Rex Rabbit in person is to fall hard into bunny love. You\u2019ll need to own one immediately and you won\u2019t regret it. The Rex rabbit has short, soft fur that points out instead of against their bodies, making this breed super plushy. The Rex rabbit has a commercial-sized body type and can weigh anywhere between 7.5-10.5 lbs. once fully grown. The ideal weight for bucks is around 8 pounds and 9 pounds for does. Pretty standard stuff.  According to the ARBA Standard of Perfection, the Rex Rabbit is a well-proportioned animal, with medium body length, well-rounded hips and a loin, ribs, and shoulders that complement them.  These rabbits are real lookers. Their head is broad and set close to the body- and, as everything about these bunnies, it\u2019s in perfect balance with the rest of their stunning physique. The ears are erect and medium-thick, evenly covered with short plush fur typical of the breed, and their legs are short and straight. As for the personality and behavior of the Rex Rabbit, you can expect this breed to be docile, friendly, and open to handling and petting. In other words, these are sweethearts and charmers in the rabbit world, destined to bring joy to any home that welcomes them in as a pet. Rabbits aren\u2019t always the most social pets, so that makes this breed particularly attractive for bunny lovers who like to get up close and personal with their pets. They love receiving attention from their humans, which makes them ideal rabbits for homes with children (who are often disappointed by the antisocial nature of many rabbits). The Rex Rabbit has a unique gene which gives its coat a velvety texture. The coat is extremely dense, and the hair\u2019s length and quality uniform all across the body. Hairs are short but not shorter than half an inch- or longer than \u215e of an inch. This short, soft fur that points out instead of against their bodies like most rabbits makes this breed feel super plushy. Unfortunately, their smooth and dense fur made them interesting to the fur industry. Many horrible owners often kept this breed around for their pelts alone. Thankfully, we are long past that unfortunate chapter in the Rex Rabbits history. They are now owned only by those who who love them as living beings regardless of how pretty their fur might be.  Now, when the Rex Rabbit is a popular pet, their unique coat is considered to be just one of their many charming qualities and not a source of profit. Despite its one-of-a-kind coat, though, this breed is not high maintenance when it comes to grooming. In fact, it requires even less grooming than other rabbit varieties. Owners should try to groom this rabbit as little as possible, as over-grooming can damage its coats. If there\u2019s excess dirt on your rabbit\u2019s coat, simply clean it with a damp cloth. Never bathe your bunny, as this causes great stress and can cause cardiac problems and even result in death. As much as you might enjoy bunny bath time, it\u2019s simply not a good idea for your pet. Fortunately there are plenty of easy alternatives. In the United States, there are 16 accepted coat colors for the Rex Rabbit breed. Some of these include castor, seal, chinchilla, opal, black, white,  Californian, amber, as well as Broken (which is any color mixed with white). In other words there is a Rex Rabbit out there to suit any personal pet preference. Rex Rabbits are great pets for seniors and first-time pet parents as well as singles or couples. To make sure your bunny stays healthy and happy under your roof, you will need to provide proper rabbit housing. The two main aspects to consider are the size and the type of materials.  Enclosures need to be large enough for your rabbit to comfortably stretch out in, have enough room to play, do its business and eat. This translates to at least 12 feet of cage space (6 x 2 feet), coupled with a minimum of 32 square feet of bunny-safe playing space, which is usually fenced by a pen or a playpen gate.  As for the bunny-safe materials of the enclosures, choose indoor cages made of strong wire that have a solid bottom. Wire bottom at the cage is a big no-no, as it will hurt your bunny and lead to sore hocks. The enclosure needs to be lined with bedding, spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week.  In order to become a socialized, well-rounded rabbit, pets need to be taken out of its enclosures as often as possible and allowed to roam free in a bunny-safe room. The longer they interact with their human families, the sweeter and more docile (and playful!) they will become. More often than not, owners decide on giving their rabbit the free reign of home. Well, after rabbit-proofing everything, of course.  Rabbits have extremely strong teeth and a tendency to chew everything, which often leads to catastrophe. Not only that your furniture or shoes could be ruined, but your bunny could die after nibbling on electric wires or eating a dangerous houseplant. So, to avoid any potential problems, ensure that the space is safe for your pet (and your valuables protected) before you let your bunny roam free. In case you have a garden or a backyard where your Rex Rabbit can play, make sure to let them out only in a well-secured pen and with you supervising them. In terms of their ideal diet, the Rex Rabbit is no different than most other bunny breeds. They require a diet that consists of 70 percent high-quality hay (such as orchard hay) with the rest being a good mix of leafy greens, fruits, pellets and vegetables. Hay such as alfalfa should only be given in moderation and fruits/vegetables which contain high levels of sugar should be used mostly as treats. Always research what kind of food you are giving to your rabbit, as there are some that are safe and others that can make them sick. Additionally, you should ensure your rabbit always has access to fresh and clean water. Unlike most animals, rabbit teeth never stop growing. Thankfully, they are also constantly being worn down by everyday activities such as chewing their food (mostly hay). If your rabbit\u2019s teeth are not being worn down, its teeth may start growing into its jaw and face, causing severe pain. Signs of overgrown teeth or an infection due to overgrown teeth include loss of appetite, slugging activity or drooling around the mouth. Be sure to check your rabbit\u2019s mouth weekly for signs of overgrown teeth and bring them to the vet if you suspect they have an infection, as it can be treated with antibiotics, and veterinarians can also fix their overgrown teeth problem. In addition to helping your bunny grind down their teeth, roughage (hay) will promote better digestion, too. Rabbits are avid groomers and will ingest a lot of their own hair during the self-cleaning process. Unfortunately, they can\u2019t vomit hairballs like cats do, and instead, clumps of hair get stuck inside their intestines. This is known as GI stasis, a potentially fatal condition that affects all rabbits. To prevent it, feed a lot of high-quality hay, groom your pet regularly, especially in the heavy shedding seasons, and inspect their feces for signs of poop that looks like string of pearls.  Ears should also regularly be checked for ear mites, as this is a common condition in rabbits, especially outdoor rabbits. If you decide to spay or neuter your rabbit, some owners notice that their rabbit tends to be less aggressive, however this breed of rabbit is not known to be hostile, so neutering your Rex may do nothing to its personality but make them calmer. Does can be spayed once they are 4-6 months old while bucks can be neutered as young as 3 and a half months old. Breeders/owners should try to groom Rex rabbits as little as possible, as over-grooming can damage their coats. Rex rabbits are generally docile rabbits who won\u2019t mind being picked up and petted, especially if it\u2019s by a family who frequently lets them out of their cage to explore their surroundings. Like any domesticated animal, it will grow attached to the family member who spends the most time with them and feeds them the most often, but it will generally be unafraid of any person who picked them up with care and pets them. Its low maintenance makes them great pets for seniors and first-time pet parents as well as singles or couples who would like to try pet ownership. This rabbit breed is suitable for children so long as they understand how to pick up and care for rabbits, as it is a fragile animal and requires a different care than cats or dogs. In terms of toys, each rabbit has its own personality and may enjoy some toys to chew and entertain itself with. It may be as simple as a toilet paper roll to an elaborate pet toy from your local pet store.", "facts": " Commercial Singles, Seniors, House/Apartment Rabbits, Families with children, First-time owners, Outdoor/Indoor Rabbits Playful, intelligent, calm, affectionate", "tags": "first-time rabbits, rabbits for seniors, rex coat type, rex rabbit, velvet fur, "}, "rhinelander rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/rhinelander-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rhinelander-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Rhinelander Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Rhinelander Rabbit originated in Grevenbroch, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany by Josef Heinz and was first shown in 1902. To create the breed, Heintz crossed a Japanese buck (known as the Harlequin Rabbit in North America) with a gray-checkered doe. One of the litter\u2019s kits was the first \u201cRhinelander,\u201d sporting some of the same dual-colored markings we know today. Heintz then crossed the Harlequin with a Checkered Giant doe, which produced a desirable kit. It was with this litter that he decided to continue to breed, thus creating the Rhinelander rabbit, which was accepted as a breed in Germany in 1905. These rabbits were brought to the United States in 1923 and accepted by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) in 1925. The Rhinelander Rabbit disappeared from American and was only reintroduced in 1972, when Robert Herschbach of California attended a German show and purchased four animals for his rabbitry back home. The ARBA once again recognized the Rhinelander breed in 1975. The Rhinelander Rabbit has a white base coat that, unlike any other rabbit, is decorated with two different colored markings. This breed has a full-arch body shape and weight anywhere between 6.5-10 lbs. once fully grown. Rhinelander Rabbits have long limbs and the same width from shoulders to hip. It also has long ears, measuring no longer than 4 3/4 inches and falling into a \u201cV\u201d shape. The Rhinelander\u2019s fur is soft, short and dense, and does not require much in order to keep it in shape. Owners should brush its coat once every other week during off-season shedding periods to remove any stray hairs. Rabbits have one or two yearly molts \u2013 during these times, you should brush your rabbit every week with a slicker brush in order to keep up with shedding. Under no circumstances should you bathe a rabbit, as this causes immense stress and can even lead to death. Instead, simply spot-clean its coat with a damp cloth. The Rhinelander rabbit has a white base coat that, unlike any other rabbit, is decorated with two different colored markings. Like the English Spot, this rabbit breed must have colored ears, eye circles and a nose marking that resembles a butterfly, as well as a cheek spot below each eye. In order to be show-worthy, Rhinelanders must also have 2-10 spots on its flanks and hindquarters that are orange/yellow and black or, since 2012, fawn and blue. Rhinelander rabbits must have colored ears, eye circles and a nose marking that resembles a butterfly. Like any rabbit, the Rhinelander\u2019s diet must consist of 70 percent hay in order to stay healthy. The rest of its diet should be comprised of pellets and a select amount of fruits, vegetables and leafy greens. Always do your research before feeding your rabbit anything from your fridge, as some vegetables, leafy greens and fruits can be hazardous to your rabbit\u2019s health. This rabbit does well in either indoor or outdoor enclosures, however rabbits seem to be healthier overall when indoors (extreme weather conditions can have an impact on your rabbit\u2019s overall health). Outdoor enclosures should be made of wire or wood and should be raised off the ground in order to protect rabbits from the elements, as well as potential predators. Indoor enclosures should be made of wire, and have a solid bottom to hold bedding tjat needs to be spot-cleaned everyday and completely replaced at the end of every week. Rhinelander rabbits are not at-risk for any particular diseases, however there are some health issues that rabbits are susceptible to. Rabbit teeth never stop growing, and a diet high in hay is the only thing that will naturally wear teeth down. If the rabbit\u2019s diet does not consist mainly of hay, the rabbit\u2019s teeth begin to grow into its jaw and/or face and will be extremely painful. A quick trip to the veterinarian (and a long-term solution of changing its diet) will remedy this problem. Outdoor rabbits that do not have sanitary cages may also develop flystrike. This is a painful condition when flies lay eggs in the rabbit\u2019s coat. In order to prevent this, always spot-clean your rabbit and keep cages in clean condition. Bucks can be neutered as young as three and a half months old, while does can be spayed at 4-6 months old. The Rhinelander Rabbit\u2019s docile, patient nature will make for a wonderful first-time pet. While not impossible, most rabbits are more challenging to potty train than your average dog or cat. Many rabbit owners have found success in placing several litter boxes across their home. With plenty of patience and rewards, your rabbit will understand the basics of potty training. In order to be properly socialized, remember to take your Rhinelander Rabbit out of its enclosure for a minimum of four hours per day. Like other pets, rabbits need plenty of time outside of the enclosure to interact with people and other animals. Rhinelanders are ideal family pets for singles, couples, seniors and families with children, as long as kids are taught how to pick up and care for rabbits.

More specifically, the breed has roots within the Salland region in the Netherlands. Known for its incredible color, the Sallander Rabbit has a small following in the U.S., as it is not yet recognized by the ARBA (American Rabbit Breeders Association). However, the breed is recognized in the U.K. by the BRC (British Rabbit Council). When this breed was first developed, the kits had a striking appearance, as their coat appeared as though it had been painted by an artist. Because of its beautiful coat, this breed is now making its way into other rabbit breeds, including the Lionhead Rabbit and lop breeds. In 1975, the Sallander Rabbit was formally recognized, and the breed was then exported to the United Kingdom in the \u201890s. Today, it is rarely seen outside of the U.K. and the Netherlands. The Sallander Rabbit has a coat that looks like it\u2019s been painted by an artist. A Sallander Rabbit can be described as fairly stocky and rounded, as well as muscular, cobby, and medium in size. The neck will be barely visible, as it is short, but the head will be robust and will feature a broad muzzle. The ears should be wide and long, and they will be roughly 4 or 5 inches long. These rabbits also have bright eyes that give them an alert and bold appearance. When looking at a Sallander Rabbit, you will also notice that the legs are powerful, despite being short. The coat of a Sallander Rabbit will be one of its distinguishing features, not only because of its coloration, but also because it is soft, dense, and short to medium in length. The lovely fur of a Sallander Rabbit will feature light gray markings that darken on the belly, flanks, and cheeks. The nails should be horn or gray in color. The ears, tail, feet, and face should be a deep, dark gray that ends up creating a strong contrast with the light gray that is found across most of the body. You will also notice a whirling pattern across the fur, making it look as though the animal has been painted. Sallander Rabbits are known for being lively, active, and skittish. If your Sallander Rabbit will be living inside your house, you need to set up a dog crate or a rabbit cage that will be quiet, safe, secure, and comfortable for your pet. You can train your rabbit to use a litter tray, and you can rabbit-proof your house so that he can roam freely without destroying your possessions. Even if your rabbit lives indoors, giving him access to the great outdoors through the use of a secure area in your garden is a good idea. If you are going to have your pet living outside all the time, though, make sure that he has a large hutch in which he can remain comfortable and dry. It should be sheltered from the elements, including direct sun, and it should be secure from predators and easy to keep clean. Provide your rabbit with a variety of high quality hays, vegetables, and rabbit pellets, and always provide clean, fresh water. Like other rabbit breeds, the Sallander Rabbit should be protected from extreme temperature changes, fumes, and dust. It is important to keep in mind that these animals are delicate and need to be provided with the right environment where they can be as stress-free as possible. Also, like other rabbits, the Sallander\u2019s teeth could become overgrown, so it is important to check his teeth regularly. Provide your rabbit with plenty of gnaw toys and fibrous vegetables to keep the teeth worn down to the appropriate size. Feeding your rabbit the right diet will ensure he will not gain too much weight and become unable to groom himself properly. This will also protect against flystrike, which overweight rabbits become prone to developing. Rabbits should also be vaccinated against Viral Hemorrhagic Disease (VHD) and myxomatosis, and you can treat your rabbit for fleas, worms, and ticks if he spends time outside. Having your female spayed will prevent uterine cancer, and it will also prevent her from becoming territorial or grumpy while in heat. Males can also be neutered to prevent spraying, especially if they are kept with other rabbits. Sallander Rabbits typically won\u2019t stay calm when handled. Sallander Rabbits are known for being lively, active, and skittish. They are not the type of rabbit breed that will stay calm when they are handled, so they are not the best choice for those seeking a family pet that will enjoy snuggling and being held. These rabbits are not a good option for families with young children either, as they do not enjoy being petted. Despite being skittish, these rabbits are not known for being aggressive. When they are understood and handled properly from a young age, they will exhibit affection towards their human family. For these reasons, it is best to introduce a Sallander Rabbit into your family only if you are experienced in handling, holding, and keeping pet rabbits.

Fehr, who first created the satinized Angora back in 1930, but gave up on the project because he thought their fur was weak. Fifty years later, a Dutch woman living in Ontario, Canada named Leopoldina Meyer was shown a copper satin doe that had a long, woolly coat. Enchanted with its fur, she paired it with a French Angora and the result was a kindling of Satin Angoras. The Satin Angora rabbit is often used as a fiber animal, which means they are bred to shave their coat \u2013 a process that doesn\u2019t cause any discomfort. Satin Angora rabbits have a commercial body type, with their sides having a slight taper from the hindquarters to the shoulders. They have relatively plain ears that can sometimes be slightly tufted and their oval head has a broad forehead and a slightly narrower muzzle. The Satin Angora rabbit is often used as a fiber animal, which means they are bred to shave their coat \u2013 a process that doesn\u2019t cause any discomfort. In order to take their coat, breeders brush the rabbit often or clip its thick coat using a pair of sharp scissors, which does not cause it any pain \u2013 like human hair, it always grows back. Although they are mostly used for this purpose, it is certainly not uncommon to have an Angora rabbit as a house pet, as they are very sociable, affectionate rabbits who love to cuddle with people and play with their own toys. A Satin Angora\u2019s fur is their pride and joy (the very reason why they are called \u201cSatin\u201d Angoras, after all). Their wool is finer, softer and silkier than other Angora rabbits. The reason their fur looks like satin is due to a recessive gene that causes the casing around the pigment in each hair to be translucent rather than opaque, like most fur. This gives their coat a distinctive sheen or luster. This gene also causes the diameter of each strand of hair to be smaller than normal wool. This means that this rabbit also produces some of the finest wool of any other rabbit breed. The Satin Angora rabbit can have white, grey, brown or tan fur, or a combination of these colors. Their wool is finer, softer and silkier than other Angora rabbits. Depending on how thick and long your Satin Angora\u2019s fur is, combing them with a slicker brush (the kind used to dogs and cats alike) once or twice a week should be sufficient to keep it mat-free. Make sure you have a bag near to take the clumps of fur off the brush and resume brushing \u2013 you may have to do this a few times. Due to their thick, dense fur, Angoras generally do well even in cold temperatures. Should you keep an outdoor enclosure, be sure to install plastic or wooden walls on three sides of the enclosure to keep the draft out. Don\u2019t keep your Angora out when the temperature is too hot if your enclosure does not a way to keep them ventilated. A large wire cage that keeps them off their soiled bedding should be sufficient to keep your bunny happy. Their diets should consist of 4-8 ounces of daily pellets, depending on their weight and age, as well as a handful of hay for their daily intake of fiber. To help digestion, feel free to add a tablespoon of sunflowers seeds to their pellets and always make sure your rabbit has fresh water at all times. Your Satin Angora rabbit would benefit from daily outdoor activity time to soak up some much-needed sun\u2026and to stretch out their muscles, of course! Always remember to always watch your rabbit whenever young children are involved. The number one health issue when it comes to Angora rabbits is Wool Block. Because rabbits groom themselves like cats, they end up ingesting loose fur that their tongues pick up. However, cats get rid of this loose fur by throwing up hairballs and unfortunately, rabbits cannot do that. Angoras are particularly susceptible to this because their fur is so thick. When their bellies are full of their own fur, they feel too full to eat and if left untreated, this causes them to starve themselves to death. The best way to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen is to regularly brush their fur and always be aware if your rabbit is eating and drinking enough during the day because if they aren\u2019t, it could be a symptom of Wool Block. Other health issues that Angoras are at-risk for include ear mites, rabbit hemorrhagic disease, snuffles, coccidiosis, enteritis, fly strike and myxomatosis. Be sure to keep a block of wood (not plywood) near your rabbit\u2019s cage, as they need to gnaw something in order to keep their teeth from growing too long. Satin Angoras do well with other rabbits and also enjoy human attention. Angoras, whether they are Giant, English, French or Satin, are docile creatures that have no problem being handled. Satin Angoras in particular have been bred as fiber animals, and so they are tolerant of stroking and grooming. The Satin Angora rabbit does well with other rabbits and also enjoy human attention. Should you have an indoor Angora, their temperament is comparable to a well-mannered cat \u2013 they will nap in any little corner of your home and will greet you at their cage door to be petted. They are also known to be little clowns and enjoy the occasional toy such as ball, piece of soft wood or even a pine cone. Angoras are generally happy bunnies that are incredibly friendly with everyone they meet, even strangers! They love to go outside to run and hop around, so having a backyard where they can get some sunshine is definitely a requirement.

This resulted in kits that had the satin gene. At first, Huey would place these Satin Havanas in shows against other Havanas. After some time, the American Federation of Havana Breeders sponsored \u201cSatin Havanas\u201d as its own breed. After many years of tweaking the breed, the Satin rabbit was recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association in 1956. The Satin Rabbit has silky, short, rollback fur that has a unique satin sheen to it. Satin rabbits weigh anywhere from 8.5-11 lbs once they are fully grown and have a commercial body type.

The Satin Rabbit needs to be taken out of its enclosure every day for a few hours in order to be properly socialized and create a lasting bond. This means taking it out of its cage when you are home to play, pet, and simply allow it to hop around and explore . You may also want to take your rabbit outside for some sunshine, fresh air, and playtime. Indoor enclosures should be made of wire with a solid bottom and be large enough for your Satin to hop around freely. Outdoor enclosures can be made of wire or wood, it must be protected from the elements (rain,shine, snow, etc.), and be on a raised platform to protect rabbits from any predators. Both indoor and outdoor enclosures need to be lined with bedding that should be spot-cleaned everyday and completely replaced at the end of every week. A well-balanced rabbit diet consists of 70 percent hay with the remaining 30 percent being leafy greens, fruits, and vegetables. There are many different kinds of hay available, however most rabbit owners opt for timothy hay as it has a high percentage of crude protein, calcium and fiber, is more readily available in stores, and is cost effective. Others types of hay to feed your rabbit includes orchard grass, oat hay, meadow hay, and alfalfa. Water should always be readily available for your rabbit to drink, either in a bowl or bottle attached to their enclosure. The Satin rabbit is not susceptible to any particular health problems, but as with any pet, preventative measures must be taken to ensure it is happy and healthy. Indoor rabbits can develop a Vitamin D deficiency, which can cause a host of problems. To ensure your rabbit has enough Vitamin D, either take it outdoors for some fresh air and sunshine, or let it play in an indoor room that has plenty of windows. Be sure to check your rabbit\u2019s ears for any earwax buildup and/or ear mites, and be sure to bring it to the veterinarian if anything seems out of the ordinary. Monitor the inside of its mouth for overgrown teeth, as this can happen when a rabbit does not have a proper hay diet (hay is important not only to its general health, but also because it wears down a rabbit\u2019s teeth, which continuously grow throughout its life). Outdoor Satin rabbits need to be checked for any soiled fur, as this results in flystrike, an deadly condition that can result in death. The hair in a Satin Rabbit\u2019s coat contains tiny air bubbles inside that catch the light and give it a satin sheen. Be sure to socialize your rabbit as soon as you can, preferably when it is still a young kit. Socializing your pet means taking the time to bring it out of its enclosure, petting it, and introducing it to children and other animals. Satin Rabbits are generally docile, calm pets once socialized, and will have no problem being picked up by an adult or child.

The breeds that were the foundation for the Siberian Rabbit are not known, but it is known that the new Siberian Rabbit breed was developed for use in the fur trade. However, because demand in that industry declined after World War II, the breed\u2019s popularity also went downhill. Nevertheless, the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) and the British Rabbit Council (BRC) worked hard at protecting this breed and preventing its disappearance. Today, Siberian Rabbits are kept as show animals and as pets. The breed has a dedicated following, thanks to its great personality and beautiful appearance. Siberian Rabbits are known for being docile, smart, and easygoing. A medium sized breed, the Siberian Rabbit features a compact and neat body that has a slightly arched back. The legs and feet should be medium boned. The head, which is proportional to the rest of the body, should also be medium in size, but it is longer than it is wide. Also, the neck should be short but visible, and the ears, which will be roughly 4 inches long, should feature good fur covering and be held upright. One of the distinguishing features of the Siberian Rabbit is its glossy, smooth, and dense coat that has few guard hairs. It should be about 1 inch long, and the coat should also have \u201croll back\u201d fur that springs back to the original position when it is stroked in the opposite direction. The Siberian Rabbit\u2019s main colors include blue, brown with a pearl gray undercoat, black with a blue undercoat, and lilac. The color should be the same hue over the entire body, and there should be evenly distributed and obvious flecking that blends in with the rest of the fur. White hairs on this breed are actually considered a fault. The eyes will be lilac, brown, or blue to match the color of the rabbit\u2019s coat. However, the black Siberian Rabbit will have dark brown eyes. The Siberian Rabbit has a beautiful, glossy, dense coat. When housing your rabbit outside, the hutch should be totally protected from the elements. The enclosure should also be large enough that your rabbit can hop and move around comfortably. If you are housing your rabbit indoors, be sure to rabbit-proof your belongings. You can also give your pet some access to the great outdoors by setting aside a secure spot in your garden where he can explore and play. Feed your rabbit a varied diet that consists of rabbit pellets, plenty of veggies, and high quality hays. Some good examples of vegetables for rabbits include dandelion leaves, kale, carrot tops, and cabbage. When it comes to hays, you can provide your rabbit with orchard grass, Timothy hay, oat hay, and meadow hay, as a few examples. Also be sure that clean water is always available. And starchy veggies and fruits can be provided as a treat, as they should be limited in a rabbit\u2019s diet. The Siberian Rabbit is considered generally hardy, but these animals, like other rabbits, are still delicate. First off, their teeth will grow continuously, so you need to keep an eye on your pet\u2019s teeth to ensure they are not becoming overgrown. Giving your rabbit plenty of fibrous veggies and gnaw toys will help keep the teeth at the appropriate length. Monitoring your pet\u2019s diet will also ensure he does not gain too much weight, which would make it difficult for him to groom himself, making him vulnerable to flystrike. And you can also discuss having your rabbit spayed or neutered, as well as vaccinated against illnesses like Viral Hemorrhagic Disease (VHD) and myxomatosis. Also keep in mind that, like other rabbits, the Siberian could be vulnerable to viral infections and colds, but you can help prevent these ailments by keeping your pet in a stress-free environment that is also free of drafts and sudden temperature changes. Keep an eye out for conjunctivitis and ear mites, as well as intestinal problems like coccidiosis, hairball obstructions, and bloat too, as they are also common amongst rabbits.

The breed was recognized and a working standard was approved by the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) in 1925. At first, this breed was known as the American Heavyweight Silver but the name was changed to American Silver in 1929 and later to Silver Fox. It is known to be one of the rarest breeds in America and is considered to be threatened by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. The Silver Fox Rabbit is known to be one of the rarest breeds in America.

Despite this, it does not require any special treatment in the grooming department. Bi-weekly grooming with a slicker brush during off-shedding seasons should be sufficient. Remember to never bathe your rabbit, as this causes them great stress. Instead, use a damp cloth to spot-clean any impurities on its coat. While Silver Fox Rabbits come in a variety of colors (such as blue, chocolate and lilac), the ARBA only currently accepts black Silver Foxes. Blue Silver Fox rabbits were accepted by the ARBA, however it was removed in the 1970s due to decrease in the number of blue Silver Foxes being shown. Silver Fox rabbits are known to be gentle, docile creatures and are wonderful mothers. Like any other breed of rabbit, Silver Fox rabbits require a diet consisting of at least 70 percent hay. The rest of the diet is made up a healthy balance of pellets, leafy greens, fruits and vegetables. Be aware of what kind of leafy greens you feed your rabbit, as some of them (like iceberg lettuce) contain no vitamins or nutrients. On the contrary, it contains landanum, which can be harmful in large quantities. Be careful of what kind of vegetables you feed your rabbit, as some are harmful (such as beans, cabbage, potatoes, etc), and other fruits contain too much sugar to be healthy for them. Silver Fox rabbits require a large enclosure to live a lengthy, comfortable life. Should your rabbit spend most of its time outdoor, wood enclosures that are raised from the ground and have a fenced bottom with a ramp are preferred to keep rabbits safe from the elements as well as predators. Indoor enclosures should have a wire frame on the sides and a plastic bottom where pet owners can place bedding.  Some rabbit cages also have wire bottoms, however the wire is harsh on your rabbit\u2019s feet, so use bedding is soft and more comfortable. Because of that, don\u2019t use wire-bottomed cages for any rabbit, especially the Silver Fox because of its large size. Be sure to spot-clean the bedding every day to give your rabbit a dung-free area to sleep and completely change the bedding every week. Pet Silver Fox rabbits should spend a good chunk of its time out of enclosures in order to cultivate a docile, friendly rabbit that is accustomed to humans of any age, as well as other pets such as dogs and cats. The Silver Fox Rabbit enjoys exploring its surroundings whether indoors or out, so always make sure indoor rooms are bunny-safe (no hazards such as exposed wires) and outdoor spaces should be fenced in to prevent running/hopping off and/or keep it safe. Silver Foxes are not susceptible to any particular disease and is, overall, a healthy rabbit. The inside of its ears should be regularly checked for ear mites or excess buildup of wax, and must be cleaned periodically. Like most other rabbits, the Silver Fox Rabbit should also be checked for overgrown teeth, as teeth do not stop growing. Rabbits that have a correct balance of hay, fruits and vegetables, however, should have no problem with overgrown teeth.

While this breed of rabbit is not susceptible to digestive issues such as Wool Block, care has to be taken in order for it to live a long, healthy life. Two problems that are most common in outdoor rabbits are ear mites and flystrike. Flystrike occurs from soiled fur, usually during the summer. Flies lay their eggs in soiled fur and the larvae eat the rabbit. Flystrike is extremely painful, and symptoms include lack of appetite, fewer droppings in your bunny\u2019s cage and sudden jumping/thrashing in pain. If you suspect flystrike, immediately take your rabbit to a veterinarian to get treated.

If your rabbit\u2019s diet does not consist of 70 percent hay, its incisors could begin to grow into its face/jaw. This is a painful condition and can only be corrected by a veterinarian, who can shave down the teeth. A simple change in your rabbit\u2019s diet should keep its teeth naturally worn down.

Rabbits are harder to litter train than other animals such as cats, dogs and birds, however it is possible with lots of patience, perseverance, and plenty of treats. Many rabbit owners will have a few boxes scattered across their home so their rabbit can easily access the litter box.  Training them may take a few days to a few months. Be sure to provide your rabbit with a few bunny-safe toys. Rabbits have different personalities and can be picky with toys. Some rabbits are content with cardboard or a discarded piece of wood, while others require elaborate toys that provide mental stimulation.

The Silver Rabbit was introduced onto American soil and was accepted into the American Rabbit Breeders Association (then-called the National Pet Stock Association) around 1910. It was one of the first breeds to ever be accepted and today, it is accepted in three different varieties: black, brown and fawn. The Silver Rabbit is primarily brown, fawn or brown, and its coat is intertwined with white guard hairs, giving it a beautiful silvery luster. Once you\u2019ve put your hands on a Silver rabbit, you will notice that they feel unlike any other rabbit you\u2019ve ever held before. Silver Rabbits have a hard, stocky body with dense, short coats. It weighs anywhere from 4-7 lbs once fully grown. Despite having a compact body type, it is medium in length rather than short.

It snaps back into shape quickly after you run your hand from the top of its head to its back. The rabbit is primarily brown, fawn or brown, and intertwined in its fur are white guard hairs, which give the Silver rabbit a beautiful silvery luster. Despite its unique fur, it doesn\u2019t require any more grooming than the typical rabbit. It should be brushed with a slicker brush about once every week to keep stray hairs at bay. The Silver rabbit is accepted in only three different colors: black, brown and fawn. It does not have any particular markings or patterns to distinguish it from any other breed. Silver rabbits are active animals that need to be let out of its cage to release pent-up energy. Indoor rabbit enclosures should be made of wire, have a plastic or metal bottom, and be large enough for the Silver to stretch out. The bottom of the cages need to be covered in rabbit-safe bedding \u2013 it needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. In warmer environments, the Silver Rabbit can live outdoors in a raised enclosure made of either wire or wood. When it comes to their diet, this rabbit breed needs access to clean, fresh water and high-quality hay.  Hay should be 70 percent of its diet while the rest should be a healthy balance of pellets and rabbit-safe vegetables, fruits and leafy greens. There are some foods that should be avoided (iceburg lettuce, for example, does not have enough nutritional value to be worth feeding) while others are completely fine in moderation (apples and carrots are a wonderful treat). Check your rabbit\u2019s ears biweekly for any sign of ear mites, as this is common in outdoor rabbits. Flystrike is also another issue that occurs when flies lay eggs in a rabbit\u2019s soiled coat (usually on their bottom). Lack of appetite, lethargy and/or sudden yelps can be signs of flystrike. Take your rabbit to a local veterinarian if you believe it has flystrike. A pea-sized amount of deworming paste is recommended every fall and spring. As well, if your Silver Rabbit\u2019s diet does not consist of 70 percent  hay, its teeth may begin to grow into its faces/jaws. This is a painful condition and can only be corrected by a veterinarian, who can shave down the teeth. A simple change in diet should keep teeth naturally worn down. Bucks can be neutered as young as three and a half months old and does can be spayed at 4-6 months of age. Spaying and neutering your rabbit can not only prolong their life, but it can also make them less aggressive. The Silver rabbit is considered a rare breed. If you happen to get your hands on a Silver, consider yourself lucky \u2013 the breed is rare and the original type is only available in the United Kingdom or United States. Having said that, the breed is relatively calm and gentle-natured and are an excellent choice for seniors, singles, or couples. With proper socialization, this rabbit breed is also wonderful for growing families with other even-tempered animals and children of any age, so long as kids have been properly trained on how to handle and take care of a rabbit. Silver rabbits are also active creatures that need to be out of the cage for a few hours to stretch its legs and let out all of the day\u2019s energy. This, of course, means they are quite adventurous and love to explore. Like other rabbits, Silvers enjoy playing with its human family. Small- to medium-sized dog harnesses often fit rabbits of this size, which is a great idea if you\u2019re looking to take your rabbit outside for some Vitamin D. Rabbits are a little bit harder to potty train than other animals (such as dogs, cats or birds) but with the correct amount of patience, repetition and rewards, Silvers will pick up on the training.", "facts": " Compact Singles, Seniors, House/Apartment, Families with children, First-time owners, Outdoor/Indoor Rabbits Friendly, docile, active, affectionate", "tags": "dense flyback fur, domestic rabbit, rare rabbit breed, Silver Rabbit, white guard hairs, "}, "smoke pearl rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/smoke-pearl-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/smoke-pearl-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Smoke Pearl Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Smoke Pearl Rabbit appeared for the first time in public in a show in 1926. Mr. Lawrie Stenhouse of Scotland developed this breed, and it is one of just two rabbit breeds that are truly of Scottish origin. Originally, Mr. Stenhouse bred Chinchilla Rabbits, Sable Rabbits, and Beveren Rabbits, but it isn\u2019t clear whether the Smoke Pearl Rabbit is the result of using dilute Sable Rabbits or if there was a crossing of Blue Beverens with Sables. When this breed was shown for the first time in the middle of the 1920s, it was known as the Smoke Beige Rabbit. However, the name was changed in 1932 because it was believed that Smoke Pearl was more attractive. That was also the year that the British Fur Rabbit Society accepted this new breed. Beyond that point in history, however, there are only a few records regarding the breed. A lot of experts think that it never gained the popularity that it needed outside of Scotland, or that it may have gone extinct. But about 10 years later, the Smoke Pearls started making appearances again within the litters of Sable Rabbits in the Midlands. Breeders were then determined to make this breed a success. They lobbied for it to be accepted by the new show society, and a national club was formed in 1945, when the Smoke Pearl started to gain in popularity again. Today, the Smoke Pearl Rabbit is a rare breed, so it is difficult to find. The Smoke Pearl Rabbit has a luxurious, thick, and soft coat. When looking at a Smoke Pearl Rabbit, you will notice that this is a small to medium sized breed that features a well-muscled and neat body with a slight arch to its back. It also carries the tail in a straight line, and the legs and feet are straight as well. The head is longer rather than square, and the well furred ears are short but they are held upright. Also, the eyes will be bright and bold and have a red glow to them. Because the Smoke Pearl Rabbit was bred originally for its fur, it features a luxurious, thick, dense, and soft coat. In fact, the coat is so thick that this rabbit has a cuddly appearance. The color of the beautiful coat on the Smoke Pearl Rabbit is a smoky brown or blue. In fact, the main colors for this breed include beige, blue, and light pearl gray. You will notice that there are smoky points that are combined with white guard hairs and a pale saddle area, creating the impression of a light underside. The ears, though, should not have any white ticking. The Smoke Pearl Rabbit is a rare breed, so it is difficult to find. You can house your Smoke Pearl Rabbit indoors or outside. Just make sure that your pet has an outdoor hutch that is completely weatherproof and waterproof. It should be placed in a spot that is secure and sheltered, and it should be spacious and easy for you to clean. It should also be large enough for your rabbit to comfortably move around in all directions, stand up on his hind legs, and hop. Even if your pet will be housed indoors, providing him with regular access to a safe garden area will give him the exposure to the great outdoors that he craves, and it will allow him to be active as he explores. When your pet is exploring and playing indoors, however, be sure your belongings have been rabbit-proofed to prevent things like cables from being chewed on. You can also train your pet to use a litter tray, and he should have his own cage or crate to retreat to for silence and security. The Smoke Pearl Rabbit is a hybrid breed, so it is considered relatively hardy, as well as generally free from hereditary diseases. Nevertheless, you should still watch out for the ailments that commonly affect all rabbits, as they are delicate animals that require plenty of love and care. One of the main things that you will need to look out for is overgrown teeth. Because rabbits\u2019 teeth grow continuously, you will need to provide your pet with plenty of high-fiber vegetables, as well as gnaw toys that are designed for rabbits. Doing so will ensure the teeth remain healthy and are always at the appropriate length. Whether you house your rabbit indoors or outside, always protect your pet from extreme temperature fluctuations, as well as polluted or dusty conditions that could results in respiratory problems. By feeding your rabbit a diet that is packed with vegetables, hays, and rabbit pellets, you can rest assured that your rabbit will not become overweight or obese. Overweight rabbits won\u2019t be able to groom themselves properly, leaving them vulnerable to developing flystrike. You can also talk to your vet about having your Smoke Pearl Rabbit vaccinated against conditions like myxomatosis and Viral Hemorrhagic Disease (VHD), and you can discuss having your rabbit treated for worms, ticks, and fleas as well. These rabbits are laid-back and enjoy being around people. In addition to it attractive appearance, the Smoke Pearl Rabbit is popular because of its wonderful, affectionate personality. These rabbits are laid-back and enjoy being around people because they prefer having the attention on them. They also enjoy cuddling and being stroked, and they will bond rather quickly with other Smoke Pearl Rabbits, so you can keep more than one as a pet. This rabbit breed is a great choice for families with children, as well as beginner rabbit owners. They really do crave human company, and they require playtime and fun. They also don\u2019t mind being picked up by those who know how to handle rabbits gently, and they like being petted and stroked. Just be sure that you and your family have plenty of time to devote to your pet before introducing a Smoke Pearl Rabbit into your household.", "facts": " Semi-Arch/Mandolin Rabbit owners of all experience levels, including families with children Friendly, cuddly, enjoys attention, social, affectionate, laid-back", "tags": "Beveren rabbit, chinchilla rabbit, rabbit, rabbit breed, Sable Rabbit, Smoke Pearl Rabbit, "}, "standard chinchilla rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/standard-chinchilla-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/standard-chinchilla-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Standard Chinchilla Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Standard Chinchilla Rabbit originated in 1919 in France, developed by crossing wild rabbits with Beverens and Himalayans. Its unique coat color made it an instant hit, especially when it first appeared in United States, where it was an absolute sensation. Chinchillas were considered \u201cthe next best thing\u201d after the Belgian Hare and circa 1920s, thousands were registered with what would later become the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). The Standard Chinchilla Rabbit was soon developed to be larger and longer, which led to the development of the American and Giant Chinchilla. All three \u201cChin\u201d breeds were recognized by the ARBA in 1930. There is only one color accepted by the ARBA \u2013 the color of an actual chinchilla. Standard Chinchillas can weigh anywhere from 5-7 lbs. once fully grown and have a plump, company body type. This breed also has erect ears which should not exceed five inches in length. The Standard Chinchilla has soft, rollback fur which , like most short-to-medium haired rabbits, do not require much grooming in order to keep it in show-worthy condition. Should your rabbit\u2019s fur become stained, never give them a bath- instead, spot-clean them with a damp cloth. Grooming should be done bi-weekly during off-molting seasons and weekly when their molts are in full swing. There is only one color accepted by the ARBA and that is the color of an actual chinchilla. The under color is dark slate blue at the base and the top edge a darker blue with a portion of light grey in between. The slight eye circles are well defined and of a light pearl color, and the underside of the tail is also white while the topside is mostly black with a few white hairs. Eye colors can be brown, blue-grey or marbled, however dark brown is preferred. The Standard Chinchilla Rabbit is known to be sweet, docile creatures who have no problem being picked up by their owners or strangers. . Indoor enclosures need to be large enough for your rabbit to comfortably stretch out to its full length, plus have room leftover so it can play with any toys in its enclosure, plus food, water and anything else in the cages. These enclosures need to be made of wire and should have a solid bottom made of either metal or plastic in order for bedding to be placed. This bedding needs to be spot-cleaned for cleanliness every day and completely replaced at the end of very week. The diet of a Standard Chinchilla Rabbit is like any other rabbit, which means it needs a diet consisting of at least 70 percent good-quality hay (timothy\u2019s hay is what most rabbit breeders tend to purchase). Fruits and vegetables can also be used as incentives or treats to reward your bunny whenever it completes a task or obeys a command (such as sitting, staying, or using their litter box). Adult rabbits can eat about 1/4 cup of high-fiber pellets everyday for every 5 lbs. it weighs. Always make sure to research what kind of fruit/leafy green/vegetable you\u2019re planning on feeding them, as some are not recommended for rabbits. Standard Chinchillas are susceptible to problems such as overgrown teeth, flystrike and ear mites. Rabbit owners need to check their rabbit\u2019s ears every 2-3 weeks for mites. If your rabbit\u2019s diet does not consist mainly of hay, it may develop overgrown teeth. This will affect if/how much it eats, as its constantly growing teeth can grow into its jaws and faces and be painful. This can be corrected with a quick trip to your local vet at first, and then switch to a diet that is higher in hay, as it naturally grinds down your rabbit\u2019s teeth. Female rabbits (called does) can be spayed when they are as young as four months old, however vets tend to wait until they are six months old. Male rabbits (called bucks) are eligible to be neutered as young as three and a half months old. All rabbits should also be given worm prevention treatment and checked for ticks and fleas regularly. The Standard Chinchilla\u2019s unique coat color made it an instant hit when it first came to the United States. Standard Chinchilla\u2019s are known to be sweet, docile creatures who have no problem being picked up by its owners or strangers, so long as it is handled with care. Being smaller than the American or Giant Chinchilla means that it is more suitable for children, as it is smaller and easier to hold and pet. Its size also makes it a wonderful pet for those living in houses or apartments. Its thick fur also makes it suitable for indoor and outdoor conditions, so long as outdoor enclosures are properly built to allow for proper air flow as well as shelter it from harsh weather conditions. Standard Chinchillas make excellent pets for seniors, singles, couples and growing families alike. Like most rabbits, the Standard Chinchilla Rabbit needs to be out of its enclosure for several hours a day and interact with other animals and humans alike in order to be properly socialized. This means opening the cage and allowing it to explore the room as well as taking it outside to it can get some much-needed fresh air and sunshine.\nThis breed also enjoys having toys that they can play with and chew up. The most popular toys rabbits seem to enjoy include cardboard boxes, plastic baby key rings, toys that have bells in them and stuffed animals! Your rabbit may also enjoy gnawing on a piece of rabbit-safe wood (this keeps its forever-growing teeth in check as well), a ball or even an empty roll of toilet paper it can roll around and chew up. However, every rabbit is different and rabbit owners will only know what its favorite toy is by process of elimination. Most rabbits are a little more difficult to train than the common house cat or dog, however it is not impossible. Litter training is very much possible with lots of patience, rewarding and a few well-placed litter boxes around the house.

Created in the early part of the 1980s by crossing the Lilac and Californian rabbit breeds, the Sussex Rabbit is described as being like a teddy bear, not only because of its personality, but also because of its cream or gold colored coat. Even though the Sussex Rabbit is still a rare breed because it is newer than other breeds, as more and more people learn about its lovable personality, it is developing a large base of fans. Today, Sussex Rabbits are kept as companion animals, but they also excel as show rabbits. The Sussex Rabbit is a fairly new breed. A Sussex Rabbit will be attractive, regardless of which of its two colors it sports. You will notice that the body shape can be described as well rounded. The head will be short and the legs will also be short. The ears will be held upright as well. The coat of a Sussex Rabbit will be soft, dense, and thick, but it will also be short. Because your rabbit\u2019s coat will be dense and thick, you should brush your pet at least once a week for the majority of the year. However, during molting seasons, you should increase the grooming sessions to once a day. The Sussex Rabbit is a breed that features two colors. One is a gold color, also known as the teddy bear color. This is a red-gold color that features chocolate brown shading. The other color would be cream, which is much lighter and features lilac or pink-cream shading. Sussex Rabbits are greedy with food and prone to excess weight gain. Your Sussex Rabbit will be an herbivore, so it is important to feed him a varied diet that consists of a range of vegetables, fruits, rabbit pellets, and high quality hays. Also be sure to always provide your pet with a source of clean, fresh water to drink. This will ensure that he will get all of the nutrition and hydration that he needs to thrive. This breed is well suited to living indoors, but you can certainly let your rabbit outside in your garden to get some more fresh air, sunshine, and exercise than he would get indoors. Just be sure to provide him with a safe environment in which he can freely explore. Whether indoors or outside, provide your pet with a cage, hutch, or crate that he can use to relax in and move freely in. Outdoor enclosures should be weatherproof as well. Thanks to its small size, the Sussex Rabbit can live comfortably with other pets, including dogs and cats, provided that they all get along. One of the main health concerns that you need to worry about with a Sussex Rabbit is weight gain. It is important to monitor your pet\u2019s weight and ensure that he does not gain too much weight, especially since this breed is known for being quite greedy when it comes to food. If your rabbit were to become overweight, it could become difficult for him to properly groom himself, and that would leave him vulnerable to flystrike, especially if he regularly spends time outside. Also, because the head of the Sussex Rabbit is compact, this breed can suffer from mouth problems and eye ailments. Dental problems, in particular, are common amongst all rabbit breeds, including the Sussex Rabbit, so giving your pet plenty of fibrous veggies and gnaw toys will help ensure that his teeth do not become overgrown. Talk to your veterinarian about having your rabbit vaccinated against VHD (Viral Haemorrhagic Disease) and Myxomatosis, and always check your rabbit for worms, fleas, and ticks if he has spent time in the great outdoors.

Mirjam Gille and Linda Ahlsen started working on this breed in the early 2000s, and the first litter was born in 2004. A similar breed, known as the Elfin Rabbit, was also being developed at the same time in the United States, so breeders began working together to create a single breed with a single standard. Breeders wanted to develop a rabbit breed that would be able to excel at sports and shows. Even though they were able to collaborate for a while, though, they eventually split up because of disagreements in terms of standard and name. Some of the many breeds that have been included in the development of the Swedish Hare include the Belgian Hare, the Polish Rabbit, the Dwarf Lop, the Holland Lop, the Netherland Dwarf, the English Rabbit, and the Gotland Rabbit. The Swedish Hare is bred to enjoy being athletic and active. The Swedish Hare should appear graceful, powerful, and alert. This is a fine-boned breed that is narrow in the shoulders and features straight, long front legs. The flank should be muscular and there should be strong and well-rounded hindquarters and loins. Also, the animal\u2019s hind feet will be broad and long to enhance sporting performance. The head should be fine and long, and the neck should be long as well. When you look at this rabbit from the side, the ears, head, chest, and front legs will form a vertical line. The back will form a graceful arch from the tail to the back of the neck, while the belly will be tucked up well. The tail of the Swedish Hare will be straight and it can be held flat on the floor or against the rabbit\u2019s body. The ears will be erect at the top of the head and, when measured, should be approximately the same length as the measured distance from the nose to the base of the rabbit\u2019s ears. They will also be rounded and well covered. A Swedish Hare\u2019s flyback fur will be close to its body, and the fur should not be any longer than an inch. If you were to stroke the rabbit in a reverse direction, the fur should quickly move back into its original position. Also, the coat should not showcase any matting, baldness, or wooliness. Instead, it should always be smooth. All colors, markings, and patterns are accepted when breeding the Swedish Hare. A Swedish Hare\u2019s flyback fur will be close to its body, and the fur should not be any longer than an inch. Because the Swedish Hare is a smaller rabbit breed, your pet will not require a large enclosure, but his cage should be big enough for him to move around freely, stand up straight, and stretch. You should let this active rabbit out of his cage regularly so that he can run and jump around, as well as get some much-needed exercise. If you are going to bring your pet outside when the weather is warm and dry, you should use a safe outdoor enclosure to protect your pet. Your Swedish Hare\u2019s varied diet should consist of hay, leafy greens and various vegetables, fruits, and pellets specifically made for pet rabbits. However, hay should make up around 70% of the diet. Be sure to always provide fresh, clean water too. Like other rabbit breeds, the Swedish Hare might be susceptible to conditions that include dental problems, gastrointestinal ailments, parasitic infections, respiratory infections, and head tilt. Feeding your pet the appropriate diet, making sure his cage is always kept clean, and allowing him to get physical exercise and plenty of love and attention will help you keep your pet happy and healthy, and you will also be able to recognize signs of illness as soon as they occur if you spend plenty of time with your pet.

Hermann Leifer and M\u00fcller wanted to create a rabbit breed that had a pelt similar to one of Arctic foxes, as their fur was highly coveted in that era. They started by crossing Angora rabbit with Havana rabbit, but the resulting breed wasn\u2019t what they\u2019ve hoped it to be. Even though Swiss Fox Rabbit didn\u2019t have a fox-like fur, which lessened its initial popularity, it was further developed by rabbit breeding enthusiasts to create a beautiful, docile, soft-haired rabbit we know it as today. Even though it is still a rare and relatively unknown breed, the Swiss Fox Rabbit is recognized and shown throughout Europe. The Swiss Fox Rabbit is a rare long-haired breed that makes an excellent family pet. A medium-sized breed, Swiss Fox Rabbit has a compact body type and weighs between 5.5 and 7.5 lbs. They are well-muscled, with short necks, and slightly upright posture. Their ears are strong, carried upright and long, usually around 4 inches. Although they originate from Angora, Swiss Fox rabbits have no facial furnishings, and the hair on their head and ears is shorter than on the rest of their bodies, creating an attractive contrast. Even though it\u2019s not fox-like, the fur of Swiss Fox Rabbit is beautiful in its own right. They have long hair of normal type, and their coat is very soft and easy to groom. Their glossy, silky fur is dense, with an undercoat and plenty of awn hair. During the molting season, they should be regularly brushed to help the shedding process and minimize the amount of hair that ends up in your rabbit\u2019s digestive tract. Inspired by the bluish hue of an Arctic fox\u2019s seasonal coat, the breeders first created a Swiss Fox Rabbit with a blue coat. Now, the accepted coat colors include white (with red or blue irises), black, Havana, and Chinchilla. Like all long-haired rabbits, Swiss Foxes have diluted colors, which are more pastel than vibrant. When it comes to patterns, this breed can have self (mono-colored) and agouti (chinchilla) specimens. Even though they have long, fine hair, their coat is very low-maintenance. Originally bred for commercial purpose (fur), this rabbit breed is now kept mostly as a pet. They could adapt to living in an outdoor hutch, provided that their needs are met, but would fare better if kept indoors. Swiss Fox Rabbits need a spacious enclosure or cage to spend their time in, so make sure to choose one that fits their size. The enclosure should leave enough room for your bunny to comfortably hop around, sit up straight and stretch. You should also make sure to use a rabbit-friendly bedding for the cage, such as wood shavings or straw, and clean it as soon as soiled. The bedding should be replaced entirely once a week. Not unlike all rabbits, this long-haired breed thrives on a diet that is rich in fibers and roughage. Veggies, some fruits, and rabbit pellets will provide your bunny with important nutrients, but quality hay is an essential part of their diet. Roughage such as meadow hay or alfalfa hay is not only healthy for rabbits, it keeps their teeth in check and helps their digestion. Social and friendly, Swiss Fox Rabbits will need quality playtime to be happy. If you are letting your bunny play outside, always make sure they are supervised, and in a safe, enclosed space, to prevent them from wandering away or being attacked by predators. When it comes to indoor fun, get some rabbit toys for their cage and let them out to play and exercise in a rabbit-proofed room. In case you work long hours, consider getting a pair of Swiss Foxes- they\u2019ll keep each other entertained and happy while you\u2019re away. Similar to all long-haired breeds, Swiss Fox Rabbits are particularly susceptible to digestive issues, such as GI stasis. As rabbits are avid groomers, a lot of their hair ends up in their gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to intestinal obstruction, and in severe cases, death. To prevent this problem, feed your bunny a lot of roughage and veggies high in fiber, and brush them routinely, especially during the molt seasons. If you notice pearly poop (poop connected by strands of hair), or that your bunny is constipated, contact your vet immediately. Feeding a diet with a good percentage of roughage is not only beneficial for the rabbit\u2019s digestive system, but it also helps them grind their teeth down. Rabbit\u2019s teeth keep growing throughout their lifetime, and if they\u2019re left unchecked, overgrown teeth can cause a myriad of health issues. Unless you plan on breeding Swiss Fox Rabbits, you can spay or neuter your pet. Does are prone to uterine cancer, so spaying is advisable to prevent any health issues down the road. Sterilization also helps with unwanted urine marking in males (and females), so neutering your buck is an option worth considering, too. Swiss Fox Rabbits have a sweet nature, and love to play and cuddle with their owners. Smart and affectionate, Swiss Fox Rabbits are an excellent choice for a family pet. They enjoy human companionship and can be litter trained. As long as you know how to handle rabbits properly, this fluffy bunny will love sitting on your lap and enjoy plenty of cuddles. Calm and docile, they\u2019ll get on great with older kids, but only if the children know how to responsibly cuddle with them, without lifting them up or playing too rough. Agitated rabbits can try to jump out of a person\u2019s hold, seriously injuring themselves and the handler in the process, so make sure that you don\u2019t leave your kids alone with the bunny.", "facts": " Compact Indoor, First-time owners, Experienced owners, Families with older children, Singles, Seniors Friendly, calm, docile, smart", "tags": "calm rabbit breeds, cuddly rabbit, docile rabbit breeds, family-friendly rabbit breeds, kid-friendly rabbit breeds, sweet rabbits, Swiss Fox Rabbit, "}, "tan rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/tan-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tan-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Tan Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "This breed was discovered around 1880 in England when a colony of wild rabbits bred with domestic rabbits. Breeders began braising and refining the tan-marked rabbits, and the breed grew in popularity. England had established black, blue and lilac Tan Rabbits by the 1920s. A decade later, it made its way to the United States, and the first Tan specialty club was formed circa 1936. However, this club was later replaced by the Tan Rabbit Specialty Club in 1960, but it wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that the full-arched breed became popular. After the breed standard underwent major revisions, a Tan rabbit won Best in Show at the American Rabbit Breeder\u2019s Association (ARBA) Convention in 2003, and it continues to grow in popularity. Tan rabbits are one of the few ARBA-accepted rabbit breeds that have a fully arched body. Tan rabbits are one of the few ARBA-accepted rabbit breeds that have a fully arched body. This means it has an arch starting at the nape of the neck that runs smoothly over its shoulders, midsection and hips. Tans have a lean, well-balanced body, and have large ears that stand tall on its head. Tan rabbits have glossy flyback fur. Like most rabbits, it does not take much maintenance in order to keep clean Never give your rabbit a full bath, as this causes great stress and can even lead to death. Instead, spot-clean your rabbit with a damp cloth whenever necessary (rabbits are generally clean animals, so owners do not have to worry too much about hygiene). Rabbits will shed a little bit more than usual twice a year, so you will notice an increased amount of stray hairs in your clothes and around your home during these times. To avoid this, simply brush your rabbit outdoors 1-2 times per week with a slicker brush during heavy shedding periods; otherwise, grooming your Tan Rabbit once every two weeks should be sufficient. When breeding full-arched rabbits, the Tan is the easiest to be show-worthy as every tan kit produced will always have the same colors as the buck and doe parent. All Tan rabbits have a red-orange highlight pattern on an otherwise dark coat (which can be blue, lilac, chocolate or black); the dark shading is on the Tan\u2019s back, head and sides. The tan markings are found on the inside of the ears, jowls, nostrils, around each eye, underside of tail, belly, chest and the nape of the neck. Tan rabbits have glossy flyback fur that\u2019s easy to maintain. Like any rabbit, the Tan rabbit\u2019s diet must consist of 70 percent hay in order to stay healthy. The rest of its diet should be comprised of pellets and a select amount of fruits, vegetables, and leafy greens. Always research before feeding your rabbit anything from your fridge, as some vegetables, leafy greens, and even some fruits can be hazardous to your rabbit\u2019s health, or will not contain enough nutrients to be beneficial for its health. This rabbit does well in indoor and outdoor enclosures. Pet rabbits seem to be healthier overall when kept indoors, as owners are less likely to \u201cforget\u201d about these animals if seen everyday (plus, extreme weather conditions can have an impact on your rabbit\u2019s wellbeing). Outdoor enclosures should be made of wire or wood and need to be raised off the ground in order to protect your rabbit from the elements (such as some rain/snow), as well as potential predators. Indoor enclosures should be made of wire and have a solid bottom to hold bedding, which needs to be spot-cleaned everyday and completely replaced at the end of every week. Because this is such an energetic and lively breed, Tan rabbit enclosures need to be large enough to allow it to hop and jump without getting hurt. The Tan rabbit doesn\u2019t have any health issues particular to its breed, however rabbit owners should check their pets for common rabbit problems such as overgrown teeth. Overgrown teeth occur when the rabbit has a poor diet that does not consist mainly of hay, which slowly grinds its teeth down naturally. If your rabbit isn\u2019t eat as much, doesn\u2019t eat at all, has fewer droppings or just doesn\u2019t seem to act normal, be sure to check its mouth for signs of overgrown teeth, which can grow into the jaw or face and be extremely painful. A proper diet is also important to ensure other digestive problems do not occur. For example, if your rabbit develops diarrhea because of a poor diet, its soiled coat can attract flies in the warmer months (especially if it is outdoors). If the rabbit is unable to groom itself properly, the flies can lay eggs in the fur (near the bottom). When those eggs hatch, they will begin to eat your rabbit, causing them extreme pain (flystrike). To avoid this from happening, make sure your rabbit eats a balanced diet and check for any flies that may have landed on soiled fur. A pea-sized amount of de-worming paste twice a year is also recommended to keep your rabbit protected. You should also check your rabbit\u2019s ears periodically for ear mites. The Tan rabbit\u2019s friendly and curious nature makes it an excellent pet for a variety of owners. Due to its lively, energetic nature, the Tan rabbit may not be suitable for seniors or families with young children, as it can easily run off and be difficult to catch. Having said that, its friendly and curious nature makes it an excellent pet for experienced rabbit owners or for singles and couples looking for an active rabbit. Tans require lots of time outside of its cage in order to be properly socialized so it can grow accustomed to humans. Rabbits love to play, but it is up to the owner to find out what exactly it enjoys playing with. It can be something as simple as a ball or cardboard box, to a particular toy from your local pet store. Like cats and dogs, every rabbit has its own personality and will enjoy some toys over others. While not impossible, most rabbits are more challenging to potty train than a dog or cat. Many owners have found success when placing several litter boxes around the home, and rewarding their rabbit with a treat when it is used.  With plenty of positive reinforcement, patience and rewards, your Tan rabbit may pick up potty training.", "facts": " Full Arch Singles, House Rabbits, Families with older children, Indoor Rabbits, Outdoor Rabbits Intelligent, energetic, sweet, friendly", "tags": "active rabbit breed, flyback fur, fully arched body, Tan Rabbit, two-tone coat, "}, "thrianta rabbit": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/rabbit/thrianta-rabbit/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/thrianta-rabbit.jpg", "name": "Thrianta Rabbit", "type": "rabbit", "text": "The Thrianta rabbit breed got its start in Holland, where it was developed by a breeder named H. Andreae, who wished to create a breed in honor of the royal House of Orange. He bred a variety of rabbits (such as Havanas and Tortoise Papillon) to create this new breed of rabbit and named it after where he lived, Thrianta. This breed was recognized by the Dutch in May of 1940, just before World War II. Unfortunately, most of the Thrianta Rabbits were used as a meat source during the war and it was almost wiped out completely. The few Thriantas that did survive were bred with German rabbits, and this new breed of Thriantas were brought over to America circa 1996. The breed was recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) in 2005 and the breed continues to grow in popularity. The Thrianta rabbit breed was created in honor of the royal House of Orange. The Thrianta rabbit can weigh anywhere from 4-6 lbs once it is fully grown and maintains a compact body shape. Overall, this rabbit breed should be rounded, smooth and plump with hindquarters that all also round from all directions. It should have a short, full head set on a short neck and erect, stocky, thickly-furred ears. Thrianta rabbits have short, thick, medium-length rollback fur which is soft to the touch. It does not require any special grooming but would benefit from being groomed once every two weeks with a slicker brush. During molting season, Thrianta rabbits should be groomed every week or as necessary to remove stray hairs from the coat and keep it in good condition. Under no circumstances should any rabbit be bathed, as this causes great stress and may even cause their death. Instead, simply spot-clean its coat with a damp cloth to remove any dirt. The ARBA accepts only one color of Thrianta rabbit and that is its signature fiery red throughout its entire body with no other body markings. The Thrianta rabbit has a signature fiery red coat, with no other body markings. Like any other breed of rabbit, Thriantas require a diet consisting of at least 70 percent hay. The rest of its diet is made up a healthy balance of pellets, leafy greens, fruits and vegetables. Be aware of what kind of leafy greens you feed your rabbit, as some of them (like iceberg lettuce) contain almost no vitamins or nutrients \u2013 on the contrary, some contain landanum, which can be harmful in large quantities. Also be careful of what kind of vegetables you decide to feed your rabbit, as some of them are simply harmful (such as beans, cabbage, potatoes, etc) and other fruits contain too much sugar to be healthy for them. Thrianta rabbits do well indoors or outdoors, provided this breed is given plenty of time out of its enclosures to stretch its legs and enjoy some much-needed sunshine. Outdoor enclosures should be made of wood or wire and need to be raised off the ground in order to provide protection from wildlife. Indoor rabbit enclosures should be made of wire and have bedding that should be spot-cleaned every day for cleanliness, and completely changed out at the end of every week. To have a well-rounded Thrianta rabbit who is friendly of new people (young or old, new or familiar), proper socialization is a must. This means taking your Thrianta kit out of its enclosure for as long as you can every day and introducing it to new experiences (such as being outside) and allowing newcomers to pet and play with your rabbit in your home. Rabbits also do well with other non-threatening pets, so long as the other animal is also willing to accept the new pet into its home. Remember to always be present when two animals are together, as they don\u2019t always get along (as much as we hope they do). Due to the Thrianta\u2019s short coat, it is not at-risk for digestive issues such as woodblock, however it is still susceptible to problems such as overgrown teeth, flystrike and ear mites. Rabbit owners need to check their rabbit\u2019s ears every 2-3 weeks for mites, and if your rabbit\u2019s diet does not consist mainly of hay, it may develop overgrown teeth. This will affect if/how much it eats, as its constantly growing teeth can grow into its jaws and faces and be painful. This can be corrected with a quick trip to your local vet at first, and then switch to a diet that is higher in hay, as it naturally grinds down your rabbit\u2019s teeth. Female rabbits (does) can be spayed when they are as young as four months old, however vets tend to wait until they are six months old, as there is less risk involved on the operating table. Male rabbits (bucks) are eligible to be neutered as young as three and a half months old. All rabbits should also be given worm prevention treatment and checked for ticks and fleas regularly. The Thrianta rabbit is an excellent breed for those wanting to try out pet ownership with a rabbit, as they are gentle, sweet animals. The Thrianta rabbit is an excellent breed for those wanting to try out pet ownership with a rabbit, as they are gentle, sweet animals who do not require much maintenance in order to keep it happy. Its docile nature also makes them excellent pets for families with younger children, as its size is small enough to be manageable but not small enough to be extremely fragile or easy to accidentally hurt. The Thrianta Rabbit also make great pets for singles, couples and seniors. Rabbits are much harder to litter train than other animals such as cats, dogs and birds however it is possible with lots of patience, perseverance and plenty of treats. Many rabbit parents will have 5 or 6 litter scattered across their home so their pet rabbit can easily access the litter box instead of doing the deed wherever they please.

This German rabbit breed is still popular throughout Europe, but can be more difficult to find in North America, and it isn\u2019t recognized as a breed by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). This breed was named after the town where David G\u00e4rtner developed it. It is believed that the Thuringer Rabbit was created by crossbreeding the Himalayan Rabbit, the Silver Rabbit, and the Flemish Giant Rabbit. Only a few Thuringers survived World War II, so it took years to revive the breed in Europe. Since their development, Thuringer Rabbits have been used for their fur, as well as their meat. The coat of the Thuringer Rabbit is dense, soft, and silky. This is a medium to large sized rabbit breed that is stocky and well-rounded. You will barely notice this rabbit\u2019s neck, but you will note the well-developed head that is set close to the body. The muzzle will be broad as well. The rabbit\u2019s long and strong ears will be held upright, and they will be covered well in fur. The ears are usually about 4-5\u201d long. Also, the legs are sturdy, and you might even notice a small dewlap. The luxurious medium length coat of the Thuringer Rabbit is dense, soft, and silky. The Thuringer Rabbit is a uniquely beautiful breed that features a coat that is buff to deep yellow ochre with blue-black ticking. The fur on the belly of this rabbit will be a charcoal color, and that color will extend along the bottom half of the rump and flanks, as well as the legs and tail. You will also notice the shaded charcoal color on the rabbit\u2019s face, especially on the ears, cheeks, and muzzle. The eyes of the Thuringer Rabbit will be dark brown or chestnut in color. The social Thuringer Rabbit will seek out your attention. These rabbits prefer a calm environment, and they should be given a cage that is large enough for them to move around comfortably, stand, and stretch. It is best to keep them indoors for the most part, as that will protect these animals from predators and extreme temperatures that could make them sick. If you are planning on letting your pet explore the great outdoors for some sunshine and fresh air, it is best to supervise him while using an exercise pen, lawn enclosure, or extension hutch. Always provide your rabbit with a source of clean, fresh water. In terms of diet, you can provide hay, pellets designed specifically for rabbits, and a variety of fresh vegetables. Grass hays like orchard, oat, and timothy can also be given to your pet for some variety. Alfalfa, however, will be high in calories and should only be given as an occasional treat. And when it comes to fresh foods, you can cut up dark, leafy greens and a variety of vegetables. Just be sure to keep starchy vegetables and fruits to a minimum in the form of treats as well. Like other rabbit breeds, your Thuringer Rabbit\u2019s immune system could be compromised by exposure to stress, drafts, and extreme temperatures. Give your pet a safe and clean environment, and handle him with care. In general, rabbits could be vulnerable to ailments like ear mites and conjunctivitis, as well as parasitic infections and intestinal problems. Pet rabbits may also develop hairball obstructions and bloat, so keep an eye out for symptoms. Thuringer Rabbits could even develop dental problems, so check your pet\u2019s teeth regularly to look for any signs that there are spurs or overgrown molars. Feeding your pet fibrous veggies will help maintain the health of his teeth, and giving him a chance to gnaw will also prevent problems, so purchase some gnawing toys designed for rabbits and place them in your pet\u2019s cage. Non-breeding females can be spayed so you can help prevent the development of uterine cancer, which is also common in rabbits. And you can talk to your vet about vaccinating your pet against Myxomatosis and Viral Hemorrhagic Disease (VHD).

According to the Velveteen Lop Rabbit Club of America, Virginia Menden started to develop this unique breed in 1990. Her goal was to mix a mandolin body type with Mini Rex fur. She also wanted the breed to showcase lop ears and weigh around 4.5 pounds, so she bred the Mini Rex with the English Lop. Other breeders followed in Virginia\u2019s footsteps, but the breed is not yet recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). One of the standout features of the Velveteen Lop is the ears. The Velveteen Lop features a mandolin shape, and the top line of the body should also have a definite arch that begins around the back of the rabbit\u2019s shoulders and reaches the highest point over the hips before sweeping in a rounded and full shape to the base of the animal\u2019s tail. When you look at this breed from above, you should also note that its sides will taper a bit from the shoulders to the hindquarters. The shoulders, midsection, and hindquarters should be well-developed, and the chest should be rounded and full. Also, dewlaps are allowed. The head should be wedge shaped. The cheeks can be anywhere from wide to moderately full, and the muzzle could be tapering to wide. The skull is medium in length and there is a curvature when you view the head from the profile. The neck should be short as well. One of the standout features of the Velveteen Lop is the ears. These should be carried low on the rabbit\u2019s head, and there should not be a noticeable crown. They should also hang close and loose, and the ear opening should face the front rather than be turned towards the rabbit\u2019s head. Ear length should be at least 15\u201d from one tip to the other. The width should be about a quarter of the length, and the overall length should be in balance with the rest of the body. Also, the ears are pliable, smooth, and soft, and the tips should be rounded and wide. Finally, the legs should be short to medium in terms of length, and they should also be parallel and straight with the rest of the body. They should also be medium boned, and the toenails could be dark or light. The fur of a Velveteen Lop should be upright, short, straight, and dense. The ideal length is 5/8\u201d, and the fur should be the same texture and length all over the body. The rabbit\u2019s guard hairs should not protrude noticeably, and they should be evenly distributed and plentiful. The fur should also appear lustrous and plush, and it should be springy and smooth to the touch. When it comes to grooming, the goal would be to keep the fur clean, and you can achieve that by brushing your rabbit at least once every day. This will serve to remove dirt and loose fur. Because the ears are long, it is also important to keep them clean. The colors of the Velveteen Lop\u2019s fur and eyes should conform to any one of the Lop Color Guide descriptions. You should notice a nose marking, solid colored ears, and a dark circle that surrounds each eye. The color line begins behind the rabbit\u2019s head, specifically on the shoulders, and it should sweep to the lower hips. The legs and feet should be white, though there are exceptions when it comes to elbow spots. This breed is not yet recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). Your Velveteen Lop should receive a diet that consists of 5% treats, 5% pellets, 10% vegetables, and 80% hay. Always provide fresh, clean water. In addition to a large cage, you should give your pet the opportunity to exercise and roam freely, particularly in areas where he can access some fresh air and sunshine. If you are planning on keeping your Velveteen Lop outside, only do so when the weather is warm, and be sure to bring your pet inside for the majority of the time. If your pet\u2019s ears get wet when the weather is cold, they can become frostbitten, and these animals can be susceptible to extreme temperatures too. To protect your pet from outdoor dangers, you can use exercise pens, lawn enclosures, and extension hutches to create a safe space. Velveteen Lops could be susceptible to viral infections and colds. You should avoid exposing your pet to drafts or sudden changes in temperatures. You should also check for signs of conjunctivitis, ear mites, and intestinal problems like bloat, coccidiosis, and hairball obstructions. Keep in mind, too, that any type of stress can lower your pet\u2019s ability to resist sickness. Velveteen Lops can be playful, but they are also docile and calm.

Wilhelm Mucke, an Austrian railway official, wanted to create a white, medium-sized rabbit that didn\u2019t have ruby red eyes. After 15 years of breeding, Mucke finally succeeded and created one of the most popular rabbit breeds in Europe. He started with breeding Dutch rabbits, but only once he crossed them with the white varieties of Flemish Giant and Holland Lop he managed to get a pure white rabbit with beautiful blue eyes and soft fur. Although the White Vienna Rabbit is recognized by the British Rabbit Council, it\u2019s yet to be accepted by the American Rabbit Breeders Association. White Vienna Rabbit is best known for its beautiful blue eyes, white fur, and docile, easy-going temperament. Considered a medium to large-sized breed, the White Vienna Rabbit has a broad, slightly elongated cylindrical body shape with well-developed muscles. The well-furred ears are between 11 cm to 12 cm long, rounded, and held upright. Their heads are large and strong, with a short neck that\u2019s not visible when they sit. Their best known for their pure white, soft coat and blue eyes. The fur of the White Vienna Rabbit is fine, silky, and very lustrous. They have medium length hair (about 1 inch long) and a dense undercoat rich in guard hairs. A distinct trait of the breed is that the ears are furred as well. Their shiny coat is easily groomed, and brushing them once or twice a week is more than enough to keep their fur shiny and lush. The regular brushing will also help minimize shedding, especially in time of seasonal molts, when rabbits tend to shed the most. The White Vienna Rabbit has a dense coat with shiny, soft hair. Vienna rabbits come in Blue, Black, Agouti, and White. The White Vienna Rabbit is always exclusively white, with pale blue irises and dark pupils. The whiteness of their fur extends evenly, and both the undercoat and the visible layer of fur are white, without markings or discoloration. Their whiskers and nails are also white. Calm and docile, White Vienna Rabbit can be kept both outdoors and indoors, as long as their needs are met and proper care provided.  However, if you are to keep a rabbit as a pet, it\u2019s recommended to house them indoors, so they can form a bond with you and your family, and overcome their initial shyness. When preparing an enclosure for a White Vienna Rabbit, you need to take their size and weight into consideration. Rabbit cages or hutches should have rabbit-friendly bedding (wood shaving, straw), and be large enough for your rabbit to be able to hop around and sit upright on its hind legs. Their enclosure should be kept clean and tidy, so remove the bedding with fresh one once soiled. Once a week, replace the bedding completely. Although this breed is considered calm and docile, they still need a lot of space to explore and roam about freely. At least a few hours a day, the White Vienna Rabbit should be let out of their enclosure, whether outdoors or indoors. If you\u2019re letting your rabbit play outside, always supervise their playtime and let them out only in safe and protected areas of your yard. In case you are letting your bunny hop around your home, rabbit-proof your home to prevent them from nibbling on electrical cords or anything else that could harm them. Even though White Vienna Rabbit is not a giant breed, it has a very strong body, and it\u2019s not easy carrying them around. Make sure that you\u2019re handling them with utmost care during playtime, as they are quick to jump out of your hands with their muscled legs, and that can cause a serious spinal injury. When it comes to feeding White Vienna Rabbit, their nutritional needs are not much different than those of other rabbit breeds. High-quality hay or rabbit pellets will make the most of their diet, as they provide all the essential nutrients and hay helps them grind down their teeth. They also enjoy vegetables (carrots, lettuce, celery), alfa alfa, and fruits (apples, pears). Fresh drinking water should always be available to your pet. A vigorous breed, White Vienna Rabbit is not susceptible to any breed-specific health issues. Same as it with all rabbit breeds, though, they\u2019ll need proper care to avoid any trouble down the road. At your first visit to the vet\u2019s office, you should vaccinate your bunny for Myxomatosis and Viral Haemorrhagic Disease (VHD). These deadly viruses are man-made diseases that were meant to reduce population of rabbits in the wild, but can now pose a serious threat to beloved pets. Your veterinarian should also provide information on deworming and flea treatments for rabbits, especially if they share a home with other pets, such as cats or dogs. As for the common rabbit health issues, be on the lookout for dental problems, the lethal GI stasis, parasite infestations and hairballs that can lead to impacted gut. Not unlike any other pet, the way to stay ahead of any potential problem is to interact with your rabbit and monitor for any sudden mood and behavior changes. Whether you have a pair of White Vienna Rabbits or just one bunny, you might want to get them spayed or neutered. Even though their temperament is already docile so sterilization is not needed to improve their character, spaying and neutering your rabbit can prevent reproductive system diseases, unwanted litters (if you have multiple bunnies) and urine marking during heat. These rabbits are gentle and affectionate. If you are looking for an energetic, playful bunny, the White Vienna Rabbit might not be the best choice for you. Known as being docile and laid-back, this breed will not mind being petted and they are quite calm. However, even though they are not grumpy or quick to snip, due to their size, White Vienna Rabbits don\u2019t make best pets to young children. In case you are thinking about getting this breed for an older child, it\u2019s important to talk with them and explain that the rabbit shouldn\u2019t be picked up, as that can lead to serious injury. This breed is a great choice for people who already had rabbits and know how to properly handle a bunny of this size. Their easy-going nature makes them great companion to seniors, or singles who are worried that their rabbit will get bored while they are at work. Of course, a proper socialization, especially at a young age, will have a big influence on the rabbit\u2019s personality. If brought up in a friendly, caring environment, the White Vienna Rabbit will become a sociable, relaxed rabbit that makes a wonderful pet.", "facts": " Cylindrical Indoor/Outdoor, Good with Older Children, House Rabbits, Rabbits for Single, Rabbit for Seniors laid back, docile, calm", "tags": "docile rabbit breeds, easy-going breed, shiny coat, sweet rabbits, white coat, White Vienna Rabbit, "}}
