This ancient equine has influenced other breeds, and it is recognized for its agility, movement, speed, stamina, and athleticism. Akhal-Teke horses, as they are known today, appeared first in Turkmenistan, which is a country located in Central Asia. More specifically, this breed comes from a flat and rocky desert called Karakum. The area is surrounded by mountains that actually played a large role in helping to preserve the purity of the breed over time. Historically, Turkmenistan tribesmen utilized these horses for raids, and they selectively bred the animals so that they would be agile and fast. Akhal-Teke horses will form a strong bond with a single person. Turkmenistan became a part of the Russian Empire in 1881. A Russian General named Kuropatkin, who had admired the Akhal-Teke horses, decided to begin a breeding farm once the war was over. It was at that point that the horses were renamed Akhal-Teke, in reference to the Teke Turkmen tribe that resided close to the Akhal oasis. The first Akhal-Teke studbook was printed by the Russians in 1943, and the breed was first imported into the United States in 1979. Thanks to the selective breeding that has occurred over thousands of years, the Akhal-Teke Horse is known for being highly sensitive, as well as sensible. The breed is even known for being able to respond to the mental suggestions made by their human companions, and they are highly intelligent animals that are dedicated to a single person. In fact, some Akhal-Teke horses might not enjoy being ridden by strangers. However, because these horses are also excitable, restless, and vigorous, they are best suited for experienced riders, trainers, and owners. Using small gestures, softly spoken words, and glances are enough to train these horses to obey, while punishments and shouting should be avoided because these animals can become defensive. If you can provide Akhal-Teke horses with daily attention and love, they will respond much like a canine would. They will readily bond with you if you give them the care that they desire and truly understand their needs. The Akhal-Teke features a golden iridescence that\u2019s evident on all colors except black Akhal-Teke horses are exotic, graceful, powerful, athletic, and elegant. The breed features several characteristics that distinguish it from other equine breeds. The head of the Akhal-Teke Horse should be narrow and long, and most of its length will be from the muzzle to the eyes. The ears of this horse are set forward, slim, and long, and the nostrils are large, while the lips are thin. This horse\u2019s eyes are typically \u201chooded\u201d in appearance, and the neck is slim, long, and set high from the shoulders. This horse breed is medium sized, with a level top-line and a strong, long back. It also features prominent withers, shoulders that are free-moving and sloped, and a tail that is set low. Thanks to the wide hip angle, this horse appears strong. Also, you will notice a narrow chest, a deep heart girth, and a sparse tail and mane. Because this is a desert breed, the horse will display hardiness and stamina, along with low-set hocks and short cannon bones. The gaskins and forearm are smoothly muscled and long, while the legs have tendons that are well defined. Also, this horse has large joints, flat knees, long pasterns, and small hooves that are exceptionally hard and round. Another interesting characteristic of the Akhal-Teke is its trot. Because this breed comes from the sandy desert, its pace is considered soft, as well as elastic, with upright patterns and a smooth manner. The horse has a flowing movement and does not swing the body. Also, its trot is free-sliding, the gallop is long and easy, and the jumping action can be considered cat-like. The Akhal-Teke is one of the oldest of all of the modern domesticated horse breeds. The Akhal-Teke Horse features skin that is very thin, and a coat that is also fine. This horse can feature a wide range of colors. In fact, all equine colors are acceptable, as are all combinations of white markings. Common colors include bay, gray, chestnut, black, dun, buckskin, perlino, palomino, and cremello. Many of these horses display an outstanding shade of gold as well because they have a sheen that can be described as glimmering metallic. This unique characteristic makes them truly lovely to behold. The golden iridescence is evident on all colors except black, and it appears as silvery iridescence on gray horses. To keep the Akhal-Teke\u2019s beautiful iridescent coat looking spectacular, you will need to regularly bathe and groom your horse. Every grooming session will also provide these animals with the attention they require, and it will serve to strengthen your bond with your horse. Basic horse grooming tools, including an equine shampoo, hoof pick, dandy brush, curry comb, shedding blade, mane comb, tail brush, and body brush can be used to thoroughly remove dirt, mud, excess hair, and other debris from all over the horse\u2019s body.", "facts": " Medium-sized, athletic Equine owners, riders, and trainers with experience, confidence, and sensitivity Sensible, sensitive, excitable, energetic, restless", "tags": "Akhal-Teke, akhal-teke breed, akhal-teke horse, ancient horse, arabian, desert horse, thoroughbred, "}, "altai horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/altai-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/altai-horse.jpg", "name": "Altai Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "The Altai horse is also known as the Alta\u2019s Kaya horse, and the name Altai is derived from the breed\u2019s place of origin, which is the Altai Mountains in Central Asia. This is one of the oldest equine breeds, as these surefooted, strong horses were bred, raised, and used as packhorses and mounts by the nomadic people of the area hundreds of years ago. The environment in which the Altai horses lived was cold, harsh, and bleak, so the breed has adapted over time in order to endure the difficult climate and conditions of the mountainous region. Their constitution became hardy and they developed high amounts of endurance and strength, especially because the nomads did not take care of them and instead left the horses to take care of themselves. As a result of this long history and adaptability, the Altai is also considered one of the hardiest equine breeds on the planet today. Although the Altai horses were pureblooded initially, there has been some crossbreeding in the breed\u2019s more recent history. More specifically, in the early part of the 20th century, the Soviet Government decided to improve the breed by crossing it with other Russian breeds, such as the Russian Don horse and the Orlov Trotter horse. As a result of the breeding program, the Altai horse became even bigger while still maintaining its hardiness. In addition to the animals that have been used for breeding, Altai horses continue to exist today in their original, native form in the Altai Mountains. The Altai horse is also known as the Alta\u2019s Kaya horse. Altai horses can be described as gentle animals that are easy to handle, as well as easy to take care of because they have adapted to be able to fend for themselves even in the harshest outdoor conditions. When it comes to their personality, these unique horses are generally considered hard working, so it usually does not take a lot of effort to get these horses to work with you. They are also considered sensible, stable, and true animals that are trustworthy and dependable. Therefore, they could make wonderful companions for all levels of riders and trainers, as well as anyone who is searching for a great horse breed that could help with work tasks or just be used for general riding. The Altai is one of the oldest and hardiest equine breeds. Altai horses have evolved to show incredible strength and surefootedness, particularly over rough terrain like steep mountain trails or rapidly moving streams and rivers. These horses are sturdy and they can survive in the toughest weather conditions as well. As a result of their adaptations to their environment, these animals have well developed tendons, muscles, and lungs, as well as a strong heart. When looking at an Altai horse, you will note that they feature a profile that is slightly dished, along with a head that is large and coarse but average in terms of length. You will also notice a neck that is relatively short and fleshy, as well as eyes that are small. And these horses will have a well developed croup, short but strong and well set legs, and a strong back that is slightly dipped and long. Plus, when checking their hooves, you will notice that they are sound and strong as well. Altai horses show incredible strength and surefootedness. The Altai horse will usually feature a coat that is gray, black, bay, or chestnut. As a result of the breeding program that has been used to improve these horses, the Appaloosa pattern has largely been lost; however, you might sometimes see an Altai horse with a leopard spotted pattern that features black spots. Because the Altai horse is not tall, it might be easier to groom this horse compared to grooming other breeds. And you can use the same routine to groom your Altai as you would use for any other equine. For example, when your Altai becomes too dirty for a simple brushing session, you could bathe him with a gentle equine shampoo. When brushing your Altai horse, you could use a variety of tools to get the coat totally clean, smooth, sleek, and soft. For example, you could start with a curry comb, which will come in handy when you need to remove a lot of debris, dirt, and loose hair from the horse\u2019s coat. Using circular motions will allow you to get the job done efficiently before you move on to using a dandy brush to remove even more dirt and loose hair. Then you could use a body brush to thoroughly clean the more sensitive areas on your Altai\u2019s body, such as the head and the lower legs. Finally, using a mane comb and a tail brush will let you detangle the hair and clean it so that it will be smooth and attractive. And after you use a hoof pick to thoroughly clean out the hooves as you check them for infections and injuries, you could also use a moistened cloth to clean around the delicate ears and eyes.", "facts": " Hardy, strong, muscular All levels of horse owners and riders  Easy to work with, gentle, willing, sensible", "tags": "Alta\u2019s Kaya horse, Altai Horse, horse, horse breed, orlov trotter, Russian Don, "}, "american paint horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/american-paint-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/american-paint-horse.jpg", "name": "American Paint Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "The American Paint Horse has a long and unique history. It is believed that Spotted Oriental horses were brought from Eurasia to Spain around 500 A.D., and they were bred with the native horses there. That breed continued to thrive in Spain, and it started to look like what is commonly known as the standard Paint Horse today. In fact, records that date all the way back to 700 A.D. reveal spotted horses that have overo and tobiano patterns, just like the modern American Paint Horse. Experts believe that American Paint Horses are descendants of the horses that were first brought over to the New World by Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s, particularly Hernando Cortes. He brought a total of 16 war-horses, and one of them was actually a sorrel and white pinto. Historians have concluded that it was likely that particular horse that ended up creating the popular American Paint Horse breed that still exists today. The American Paint Horse is one of the fastest growing horse breeds. The horses who were descendants of that stallion eventually made their way across the country\u2019s western plains and joined with the wild horse herds that were living in the western parts of America. There, the Native Americans began to revere these animals for their unique patterns, beauty, personality, and strength. They were even used by several Plains tribes, who grew quite fond of these unique, lovely, and friendly horses. In 1962, the American Paint Horse Association was formed. Today, it is one of the fastest growing horse breed registries on the planet, as roughly 50,000 registrations are recorded every year. This is rather noteworthy, considering that the association started off with just a few hundred of these horses listed at the end of 1962. The registry now includes nearly 800,000 horses.

The American Paint Horse features distinct white markings that will vary in size, even though the patterns on these horses are standard. The two predominant patterns, in fact, are tobiano and overo, which are distinguished by the white coloring\u2019s position on the animal\u2019s body. These horses are strong and fast, and they can maneuver very well, thanks to the fact that they are well balanced, with a muscular, broad chest, a low center of gravity, and powerful hindquarters.

The breed was developed in Colonial America in the early part of the 17th century when the colonists were breeding select horses that were of Barb, Turk, and Arabian descent. These equine breeds had been brought over to the New World previously, and they were later bred with the breeds that were arriving from Ireland and England. As a result of the mixing of English equine breeds with Spanish equine breeds, a compact horse featuring a strong and muscular body was created. This horse was favored for races over short distances of a quarter mile, as well as for farm related work. The English colonists started calling the animals \u201cCelebrated American Quarter Running Horses,\u201d and they introduced Thoroughbred blood into the breed later on as well. The American Quarter Horse is known for having a pleasant personality. When the American pioneers continued to move further west throughout the 1800s, the American Quarter Horse became even more valuable because it was found to have a cow sense. In other words, these horses were able to outmaneuver cattle, so they also became assets on cattle ranches that were developing across the plains. The American Quarter Horse Association was created in 1940, and that was when the breed was given its official name. Today, the Quarter Horse breed is still one of the most popular in the world. The American Quarter Horse is known for having a pleasant personality. In fact, one of the many reasons why these horses are so popular is because they have a docile and calm nature. This is an ideal breed for all levels of riders and horse owners, including those who are total beginners, because these horses get along so well with people. These horses are also popular because they are highly intelligent and willing to please. Most of them are easy to train, handle, and keep, and because they have a steady and gentle demeanor, they make wonderful companions for families. Overall, this breed is known for its strength and speed, but those features are perfectly combined with a mild temperament and a versatile personality that allows these horses to be loving companions and pleasure horses, as well as dedicated work horses. The American Quarter Horse has a docile and calm nature. The Quarter Horse has several distinguishing features, including a short, heavily muscled body with a sure-footed gait that provides a comfortable ride. These horses also have sloping and powerful shoulders, powerful hindquarters, a deep chest, and a muscular neck. The head is relatively small, with a flat profile and a wide forehead. The eyes are wide, and the ears are always alert and pointed. Also, the horse\u2019s legs will be firm, sturdy, strong, and muscular, but the feet will be noticeably small, especially when compared to the size of the rest of the body. The beautiful Quarter Horse comes in a wide range of colors. Those colors include sorrel (which is brownish red and is the prominent color of the breed), white, bay, gray, chestnut, buckskin, red dun, dun, black, palomino, perlino, cremello, grullo, brown, red roan, bay roan, and blue roan. Also, even though the Pinto and Appaloosa markings are not acceptable for this equine breed standard, it is normal to recognize white markings on the American Quarter Horse\u2019s legs or face. However, only limited white markings are allowed below the horse\u2019s knees and on the face, as they are not allowed anywhere else on the body, and the white markings could be a range of shapes, such as blazes, strips, stars, and stockings. Quarter Horses are highly intelligent and willing to please. In order to keep your American Quarter Horse looking its best, you should groom your companion regularly. A curry comb, which is one of the most important tools that you will use to groom your horse, will do a fine job of removing dirt, debris, and loose hair from the body. It will also massage the animal\u2019s skin, releasing natural oils that will make the coat shine beautifully as a result. In addition to the curry comb, you can also use a body finishing brush on more sensitive areas, such as on the horse\u2019s face and legs. Take extra care to ensure that the horse\u2019s mane is kept as clean as possible because dirty manes will be itchy, and your horse will be more likely to rub and tear out the hair if there are bugs or fungi in it. Also, only shorten the mane by pulling and thinning it by hand, rather than by using scissors.

Today, these incredible animals are used as driving horses, pleasure horses, jumpers, hunters, and more. In terms of its deeper history, this breed descended from the Narragansett Pacer, which is a breed that is extinct today within the United States. Narragansett mares and imported English Thoroughbreds were crossed in the early part of the 1700s. The descendents of those horses were referred to as the American Horse, and they featured the refinement and size of the Thoroughbred breed, combined with the intelligence required to easily learn the various pacing gaits that Narragansett horses were known for. The American Saddlebred Horse are used as driving horses, pleasure horses, jumpers, hunters, and more. American Horses became popular as riding horses because they had smooth gaits that made them comfortable to ride over longer distances.

The horses were registered only if they were able to meet the standards set for speed, including being able to trot a mile in just 2\u00bd minutes.

In fact, you may be surprised by this horse\u2019s willingness to learn and be trained. It is these characteristics that make the American Walking Pony a great show horse. American Walking ponies are willing to learn and take commands. For a pony breed, the American Walking Pony is relatively large in size. When observing this pony, you will also notice that it exhibits characteristics from both of its parent breeds. For example, from its Tennessee Walking Horse ancestry, it has acquired a naturally fluid and smooth gait. On the other hand, from its Welsh Pony ancestry, it has acquired a long, highly arched, and muscular neck, along with a proportioned and beautiful head like an Arabian. These ponies will feature a neatly chiseled, small head, along with widely set, bold eyes and pointed, well-shaped ears. The neck will be high-set, muscular, arched, and long, while the back will be short, the hips will be muscular, and the shoulders will be slightly sloped. The chest will be wide, the pasterns will be of a medium length and sloping, and the tail will be straight. The seven gaits that these ponies are able to perform are natural and inherited, and the merry walk and the pleasure walk are two gaits that are unique to this breed. The American Walking Pony\u2019s gaits are natural and inherited. The American Walking Pony features a variety of beautiful coat colors that include white, bay, gray, chestnut, buckskin, dun, black, brown, grullo, champagne, roan, perlino, cremello, and palomino. In fact, all solid equine colors are allowed within this pony breed. Just as you would do with any other equine breed, in order to keep your American Walking Pony looking healthy and attractive, you will need to have regular grooming sessions and use a high quality set of equine grooming tools to get the job done right. For example, by using a curry comb in circular motions all over the pony\u2019s body, you can easily remove all of the excess hair in the coat, along with any debris and dirt that has accumulated in the coat from the pony being active in the great outdoors. The curry comb alone will work very well at making the coat smooth and shiny, but you can also follow it with a body finishing brush in order to bring out even more of the coat\u2019s natural shine, as well as a dandy brush and shedding blade to remove even more debris and loose hair. When it comes to cleaning your pony\u2019s delicate face, use a soft sponge or a soft cloth that has been moistened with some water, rather than using a brush that could be irritating. Gently clean around the pony\u2019s ears and eyes. To keep the tail and the mane flowing smoothly and beautifully, you can use a mane comb and a tail brush to remove tangles and clean the hair as well. And to keep the hooves clean and healthy, use a hoof pick to remove any rocks, mud, and other debris that has collected within them, while also checking the hooves to ensure that they are healthy.", "facts": " Elegant, refined, muscular All levels of horse owners, riders, and trainers Willing, calm, obedient, intelligent, docile", "tags": "american horse breed, american pony, american walking pony, pony breed, Tennessee Walking Horse, Welsh Pony, "}, "andalusian horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/andalusian-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/andalusian-horse.jpg", "name": "Andalusian Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "The Andalusian Horse originally came from the Iberian Peninsula, and it is named after the Province of Andalucia, which is the part of the world where it is the most famous. It is believed to be an ancient horse breed, as a similar type of horse is depicted in cave drawings that are 20,000 years old, and Homer even mentioned these horses in his work, The Iliad. In 711 A.D., Andalusian horses were bred with the horses of the Moorish invasion, which were the Spanish Barbs. However, this breed was principally bred by Carthusian Monks during the latter part of the Middle Ages. In fact, the Carthusian Monks were excellent horse trainers and breeders, and they were able to keep the bloodlines pure. Also, Cortes was the one who was responsible for bringing Andalusian horses to America during his conquests. The Andalusian Horse breed is the foundation for many other breeds. Though the breed was threatened when Napoleon\u2019s army stole Spain\u2019s horses during an invasion in the 1800s, a herd was hidden and ultimately used to keep the breed alive and pure. And even though an epidemic in 1832 devastated the horse population in Spain, a small herd of the Andalusian horses found at the Monastery of Cartuja survived in order to keep it going. It is also worth noting that the Andalusian Horse breed is the foundation for many other breeds, including the Lippizzaner and Peruvian Paso. In Spain, where it excels in traditional equestrian pursuits and ranch work, this breed is referred to as Pura Raza Espanola, which translates to Pure Spanish Race. And it was not until 1962 that Andalusian horses were exported. Described as robust yet elegant, the Andalusian horse has a unique ability to bring its haunches far beneath its body in order to elevate its forehead. This trait makes them talented when it comes to upper movements of dressage, including piaffe, airs-above-the-ground, and passage. These horses move with upright steps when they canter and trot, and these steps are also quite distinctive. These animals are ideal for performing a wide range of tasks as well. These tasks go beyond dressage to also include jumping, general riding, mounted athletics, and various forms of work. In terms of their personality, Andalusian horses have a wonderful temperament. These animals are smart, as well as sensitive, docile, and brave. The breed has a desire to learn, and these horses can easily adapt to new and changing situations with ease. Because these horses are responsive, obedient, and cooperative, they are easy to train and quite versatile, and they can also learn quickly. However, some horse experts recommend taking on this breed only if you have experience working with horses because of their agility, heavy build, and quickness. Andalusian Horses have a wonderful temperament. The Andalusian Horse has a unique appearance. Its head is of a medium length, and its face is well proportioned with a slightly convex or a straight profile (concave or convex profiles aren\u2019t desirable). This horse also features a forehead that is slightly round and wide, a jaw that is lean and full, and a jaw line that is discreetly arched. The nose will gradually narrow and the nostrils are almond shaped, while the eyes are expressive, lively, and somewhat triangular. The ears are small, and the distinctive tail and mane are abundant, long, and wavy. An Andalusian\u2019s back will be solid and almost straight, as well as muscular and a bit short, while the withers should be subtly wide and the chest should be deep and full with arched, long ribs. The neck is of a medium length and size, and it is also muscular and slightly arched. Even the shoulders are muscular and long, and the hindquarters of this breed are lean, strong, and broad, while the tail is set low. The Andalusian Horse is easy to train and quite versatile, and it can also learn quickly. In terms of color, these beautiful horses are typically gray or white. Less commonly, however, they can also be palomino, dun, black, chestnut, bay, and dilute colors. As is the case with all other horse breeds, the Andalusian breed is one that should be groomed on a regular basis using the standard horse grooming tools that are easy to acquire. These include a hoof pick, tail brush, curry comb, dandy brush, shedding blade, mane comb, and body finishing brush. Using these tools will allow your horse to maintain its beautiful, healthy appearance. In addition to regular horse grooming requirements, however, the Andalusian breed features a thick mane that is really beautiful but does require a bit of extra work. The same goes for its luxurious, thick tail. You will need to regularly trim and pull the tail and mane in order to keep them healthy. Also, in order to keep the horse\u2019s tail thick and long, you should cut it straight across on the bottom, preferably at the height of the horse\u2019s fetlocks.", "facts": " Robust, heavy build Horse owners with some experience in dealing with equine companions Agile, quick, athletic, intelligent, adaptable, easy to train, multi-talented, sensitive, docile, friendly, cooperative", "tags": "airs-above-the-ground, ancient horse breed, Andalusian Horse, passage, piaffe, "}, "anglo-arabian horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/anglo-arabian-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/anglo-arabian-horse.jpg", "name": "Anglo-Arabian Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "Also known as the Anglo-Arab, the Anglo-Arabian Horse is a unique and popular equine breed. It is the third oldest stud book within France, as well as the third oldest horse breed on the planet. France and Britain both claim that they are the birthplace of the Anglo-Arabian Horse, and both of the countries have been working on producing this all-around horse for over 150 years. The breed combines the best of the Thoroughbred Horse and the Arabian Horse, so it will have the endurance, stamina, and soundness of the Arabian, as well as the speed of the Thoroughbred. At least 25% of an Anglo-Arabian\u2019s blood must be Arabian. At least 25% of an Anglo-Arabian horse\u2019s blood must be Arabian. However, it can\u2019t have more than 75% Arabian blood either. Also, the horse\u2019s ancestors should be Thoroughbred, Arabian, or Anglo-Arabian. In France, the breeding of the Anglo-Arabian Horse began in 1836, and it was based upon three Thoroughbred mares and two Arabian stallions. Also, in Britain, this breed was developed as a cross between an Arabian and a Thoroughbred. Anglo-Arabian stallions were being used for cross-breeding and pure breeding by 1850, and by 1860, racing competitions that featured Anglo-Arabian horses exclusively had become quite popular. It was not until 1880 that the breed\u2019s requirements were established formally. It was then that it was set that an Anglo-Arabian only required 25% Arabian blood. The breed was made a part of the French Stud Book in 1890. Anglo-Arabian horses are known for having a pleasant disposition. Even though they are considered high-spirited animals, they are manageable. These horses are intelligent and brave, as well as energetic yet sweet, making them a pleasure to work with and ride. Like the Arabian Horse, the Anglo-Arabian will be refined and intelligent, with plenty of stamina. However, these horses will also have the size and speed of a Thoroughbred, making them highly competitive athletes. Because this breed is fast and agile, and because it has plenty of energy, these animals make wonderful sport horses, though they can also be used in pleasure riding as well. Like the Arabian, the Anglo-Arabian will be refined and intelligent. Even though the Anglo-Arabian Horse is a combination of the Thoroughbred and Arabian equine breeds, it gets the majority of its physical characteristics, such as its height and head shape, from the Thoroughbred. When looking at these horses, you will notice that they feature a straight profile on a delicate, refined, and chiseled head. Their eyes will be expressive and their ears will be mobile. The neck should be slightly arched and long, and the chest should be deep. The horse\u2019s back should be short, and the withers should be prominent. The breed will also feature solid, oblique, and strong shoulders. The Anglo-Arabian Horse\u2019s croup will be horizontal and long instead of rounded. The tail will be set high, as well as carried high. The mane, tail, and coat of this breed will be silky and fine. Overall, the body will be strong and short, but the frame will be solid. These horses will also have a deep barrel, and the legs will be strong and long as well. The legs allow the horse to have a springy jump and a powerful walk. Anglo-Arabians get most of their physical features from the Thoroughbred. The attractive Anglo-Arabian Horse can showcase any of the solid equine colors. However, these horses commonly feature solid coat colors that include bay, chestnut, brown, and gray. Chestnut and bay are the most common colors for this breed. Just like all other equine breeds, the Anglo-Arabian will greatly benefit from regular grooming sessions that stimulate circulation and work on thoroughly cleaning the horse\u2019s skin and coat. Grooming sessions are also a fantastic way to bond with your horse beyond riding. You can use a dandy brush, curry comb, and shedding blade to brush your entire horse\u2019s body and remove all of the excess hair, debris, mud, and dirt that have collected within the coat. A body finishing brush could be utilized on areas like the legs and face, which tend to be more sensitive, and you can use a damp cloth to clean around the horse\u2019s eyes as well. To keep this horse\u2019s silky mane and tail looking beautiful and to get tangles out completely, you can use a tail brush and mane comb. Then you can finish every grooming session by checking the hooves closely for injuries and infections while using a hoof pick, which will effectively remove any debris, rocks, and dirt that have collected within the hooves. If your horse requires it, you can also use a gentle equine shampoo to thoroughly clean the coat.

Some of the other horse breeds that influenced the development of the Anglo-Norman horse include Russian and British trotting horses. Over time, several different body types were also created within the overall Anglo-Norman horse breed. Two of those types formed the French Trotter horse, which is a fast harness horse, and the Norman Cob, which is a light draft horse. And while the Anglo-Norman was a general riding horse that was useful in the military, these horses also contributed towards the development and refinement of other equine breeds in both Asia and Europe, such as the Freiberger, Sokolsky, Nonius, Heihe, Oldenburg, and Andravida horse breeds. The Anglo-Norman Horse was developed in France. By the middle of the 19th century, Anglo-Norman horses had become popular throughout France, so a breed association was created in 1864. During that time, these horses were used by the French military, and by the latter part of the 19th century, breeding programs for the Anglo-Norman had improved. However, the mechanization of the 20th century caused a reduction in demand for these horses, and World War II also caused many horses to die and breeding centers to be destroyed. An Anglo-Norman studbook was made in 1950 and the breed started competing in equestrian competitions as a result of the breeders aiming to create sport horses rather than carriage horses and draft horses. Then, in 1958, the studbook was combined with other warmblood saddle horses in an effort to create a national studbook for the Selle Fran\u00e7ais horse, thereby making the Anglo-Norman an extinct breed. For decades following this merger, however, the Anglo-Norman horses showcased some differences in their conformation, so the bloodlines were still recognizable. During the 1990s and 2000s, there were efforts to reopen the studbook for the Anglo-Norman horse and to set it as its own separate breed again. This caused some controversy, but the studbook was made official in 2015. Anglo-Norman horses could be described as hardworking and patient, as well as quiet and docile. They are brave and can be used for a variety of purposes, including light agricultural work and riding, but they also do well in equestrian sports, including show jumping. Anglo-Normans feature powerful shoulders and hindquarters. When the Anglo-Norman breed was further standardized by 1966, the horses began to show some distinct features despite the many breeds that had influenced their appearance along the way. For example, these horses could range from 15.1 to 16.3 hands in height, on average, but some horses will be taller. Other characteristics that help to define the Anglo-Norman horse include a facial profile that is convex and a neck that is long. The hindquarters are also powerful, making these horses great at jumping, and the shoulders are also strong. Anglo-Norman horses could be described as hardworking and patient. The Anglo-Norman horse could feature any of the solid equine colors. However, chestnut is the most commonly seen color amongst these horses. An Anglo-Norman horse would benefit from a regular grooming routine just as any other horse breed would. Using a variety of equine grooming tools will allow you to keep this horse looking and feeling his best. Whenever a horse becomes too dirty to clean with a standard brushing routine, you could purchase a gentle equine shampoo to thoroughly clean him. Otherwise, you could start with a hoof pick to completely clean out the debris and dirt that could become lodged in the animal\u2019s hooves. During this time, it is also a good idea to check the hooves to ensure that they are healthy and are not exhibiting any signs of infection or injury. You could use a curry comb to remove dirt, debris, and loose hair from throughout your horse\u2019s coat, but stick with a body brush to clean the areas of your horse\u2019s body that are more sensitive, such as the lower legs and the head. And, when using flicking motions, you could remove even more dirt and debris with a dandy brush. A mane brush could be used to get the mane to look lustrous, while a tail brush could be used to detangle the tail and make it nice and smooth. Once you have used all of these brushes throughout the coat, it should be clean and sleek, and you could then move on to cleaning any remaining dirt from around the ears and eyes by using a soft cloth that has been moistened with some water.", "facts": " Large, strong, muscular All levels of horse owners and riders Versatile, talented, willing, docile, brave", "tags": "Andravida Horse, anglo norman, Anglo-Norman Horse, Freiberger Horse, french horse, french saddle horse, Heihe Horse, horse, horse breed, Nonius Horse, oldenburg horse, Selle Fran\u00e7ais Horse, Sokolsky Horse, thoroughbred horse, "}, "appaloosa horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/appaloosa-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/appaloosa-horse.jpg", "name": "Appaloosa Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "The Appaloosa Horse is a spotted horse breed, and spotted horses date back to ancient times, as they are showcased in literature and artwork from around the globe. It took until the 1600s for these horses to be introduced in North America when they were brought over by Spanish explorers. By the early 1700s, many of the horses became a part of the lives of the Native Americans, particularly the Nez Perce of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Once the Nez Perce started breeding these horses, the animals were quick, strong, sure-footed, and agile, with a distinct coloring that made them stand out. Settlers who arrived in the Northwest Palouse region referred to the uniquely spotted horses as Palouse Horses, but, with time, the name was changed to Appaloosa. Appaloosa horses are known for being trustworthy, so they make wonderful equine companions. The Nez Perce War occurred in 1870, and Appaloosa horses helped the tribe as they tried to flee the United States Cavalry. After they surrendered, the horses that survived were given over to the soldiers, dispersed to the settlers, or left behind. Because nothing was really done in order to preserve the breed, it almost died out, but horsemen in 1938 decided to form the Appaloosa Horse Club in an effort to promote and preserve the beloved breed. Today, there are over 650,000 Appaloosa horses that have been registered within the US and around the world, with the Appaloosa Horse Club being an international breed registry for these horses. Appaloosa horses are known for being trustworthy, so they make wonderful equine companions. They are also very gentle, as well as highly intelligent. They have been bred for their great stamina and strength, and these horses are also very willing to please their owners and caretakers, so they are a great option for beginners who are new to riding horses. This breed is also very versatile, and can be used for various tasks that include dressage, general riding and endurance riding, mounted athletics, jumping, work, and racing. Appaloosa horses are very gentle, as well as highly intelligent. The Appaloosa is a horse breed that has quite a few distinctive features that make it stand out, though its conformation is also typical of stock breeds. It features a compact body with a broad head, a straight back, sloping shoulders, and strong legs. The horse\u2019s tail and mane are typically sparse as well. The characteristic that is unique to this breed, however, is the parti-colored or mottled skin. Mottled skin on a horse is different from the more common pink skin of horses because it typically has darker areas where the skin is pigmented. This gives the Appaloosa a blotchy or speckled pattern of non-pigmented and pigmented skin. Another unique feature is the Appaloosa\u2019s white sclera, which is the area of the horse\u2019s eye that surrounds the iris, or the colored portion of the eye. The sclera of this breed is readily visible, which is a feature that distinguishes it from other horse breeds. Striped hooves are yet another characteristic of the Appaloosa Horse breed. You will notice that the animal\u2019s hooves have clearly defined, bold stripes that run vertically and can be dark or light in color. Facial markings include bald face, blaze, snip, stripe, and star. Also, leg markings include heel, coronet, pastern, half-pastern, stocking, half-stocking, ankle, and lightning marks. And coat patterns, which include blanket with spots, blanket, leopard, snowflake, frost, marble, roan, roan blanket, roan blanket with spots, and solid, are highly variable. The Appaloosa Horse\u2019s base coat comes in a wide range of colors, including red roan, blue roan, bay roan, gray, palomino, chestnut, cremello/perlino, grulla, dun, buckskin, black, brown, dark bay, and bay. As mentioned above, however, the breed is also revered for its beautiful coat patterns, which vary greatly against the base coat color. The characteristic that is unique to the Appaloosa breed is the parti-colored or mottled skin. As is the case with all other horse breeds, an Appaloosa\u2019s hooves should be inspected daily so you can look for signs of potential injury or infection, regardless of the horse\u2019s activity level. In addition, you should take care of the mane and coat by grooming your horse regularly. If you have a show horse, you will need to groom the animal daily, but if your horse is just used for riding or is a pet, you can groom bi-weekly or weekly using standard horse grooming tools that include various curry combs, bristle brushes, body brushes, face brushes, hoof picks, and tail and mane brushes. It should be noted, however, that Appaloosa horses can really benefit from daily grooming because this could help keep their white coats looking clean and bright. Grooming your horse often will prevent dirt from getting deep into the animal\u2019s coat, becoming harder to remove, and owners can also consider using a horse shampoo to keep the coat as clean as possible. These horses are also prone to sunburn, particularly on their exposed pink skin and white patches on their muzzles, so it is a very good idea to apply an equine sunscreen while also providing the animal with plenty of shade.

In fact, it is believed that these horses were first domesticated from wild horses in the Middle East around 2500 B.C. The earliest documented breeders of the Arabian Horse were the Bedouin people. They were nomadic tribesmen living in Arabia, and they relied upon their horses to survive. As a result, their horses made wonderful companions, and they would share their tents, water, and food with them. And although the breed was able to thrive in an environment that was quite isolated, these horses have always been known for their sociable nature. It is thought that the Arabian is the oldest horse breed on the planet. The Arabian Horse eventually spread into Europe and other regions of the world as a result of religious wars that took place, and European crusaders ended up crossing the Arabian, which was a naturally lighter horse, with their heaver breeds of horses. Throughout the years, the Arabian Horse continued to spread into various parts of the globe as a result of both war and trade, and the breed\u2019s genetic code is now found in nearly every modern riding horse breed. It was not until 1725 that Arabian horses were imported to America, and a national registry for the Arabian Horse was recognized in 1908. Today, this is one of the most easily recognized horse breeds. Because the Arabian Horse spent so much time in close contact with humans, it is a highly sociable breed. If you are seeking a horse that will be eager to please you, this breed will not disappoint. In addition to being fast, agile, and strong, these horses are intelligent and gentle around their human companions. However, because the Arabian is a hot-blooded horse, this breed is not the best choice for beginners. These animals are best suited to individuals who have experience with equines and with training them. These horses enjoy speed and athletic activity, and they will learn quickly, thanks to their high intelligence level. Plus, when working with experienced riders, these animals are highly responsive and easy to work with. Overall, Arabian Horses tend to do much better when they are housed in large paddocks with other horses. Because they are so smart, they can become bored easily, and this could lead to negative habits and behaviors. They also enjoy having objects that they can use to play and keep themselves occupied, and this is a breed that craves interaction, so you must make time for this horse if you choose to care for it. Arabian Horses enjoy speed and athletic activity, and they will learn quickly. The Arabian breed is truly a beauty to behold, and has quite a few distinct features, such as its dished body, that make it stand out from other horse breeds. This horse has a small, wedge shaped head, and the profile can be slightly concave or straight. It also has large nostrils and a small muzzle, along with dark, expressive, large eyes that are set wide apart. There is also a short distance between the horse\u2019s muzzle and eyes, and the horse has small ears that are smaller in the stallions than in the mares. The neck is arched and long, the back is short, and croup is horizontal and long. Also, the tail carriage is high, and the tail is carried straight. Overall, this horse is well shaped and thin, and it is classified as a smaller breed. Some Arabian horses will have only 17 instead of 18 pairs of ribs, along with only five instead of six lumbar vertebrae. Arabian horses are built for stamina and endurance, even in the harshest environments. Their balance and strength are the result of their short backs, sound hooves, dense bones, and compact body. The Arabian Horse Association states that the Arabian purebred features five beautiful coat colors. They are roan, black, chestnut, gray, and bay, with bay being the most prominent of all of the colors. Purebred Arabian horses can also have a sabino spotting pattern that would feature white markings on the face, belly, or upper legs. On the other hand, half-Arabians, which are produced by crossing a purebred Arabian with another breed, might have other coat colors. But all Arabian horses, regardless of their coat color, will have black skin everywhere except under white markings, if they have any. The dark skin is what helped to protect these horses from the harsh sun in their desert environment. In terms of grooming, the Arabian Horse requires regular grooming, just as any other horse breed. This will ensure the coat remains healthy and lustrous. Owners can use standard horse grooming tools, including a body finishing brush, curry comb, shedding blade, and dandy brush for use on the body, along with a mane comb, tail brush, and hoof pick. These can be used to remove dirt, loose hair, and debris from the coat and hooves, as well as keep the tail and mane smooth and clean.

Prior to European travelers and settlers migrating to Australia, it was a continent that did not have any native horses. Therefore, many of the horses that are living in Australia today are the result of people importing equine breeds from all over the world. Nine horses were part of the First Fleet from South Africa in 1788, and they arrived in Australia that year. Timor Ponies, which were from Indonesia, also arrived in Australia in 1803. In addition to those original horses, other equine breeds have played a large role in influencing the development of the Australian Pony. Those include the Welsh Mountain Pony, the Exmoor Pony, the Connemara Pony, the Hackney Pony, the Shetland Pony, the Highland Pony, and the Hungarian Pony. The Australian Pony was influenced by a variety of equine breeds. Overall, the Australian Pony breed has been influenced by many horses that were imported to Australia throughout the years. For example, two Exmoor stallions, in particular, are considered as having been pivotal in the development of the Australian Pony. They were called Sir Thomas and Dennington Court, and they were sent to Australia in the middle of the 19th century. Also, Bonnie Charlie, who was a Hungarian stallion, was brought to Australia in the second half of the 19th century, and a Welsh Mountain Pony known as Dyoll Greylight also arrived there in 1911, while a Welsh Cob with Hackney bloodlines, known as Little Jim, was imported in 1909. A new and distinct, handsome pony breed was finally created in 1920, and the Australian Pony Stud Book Society, also known as APSB, was created in 1931. It is the oldest and largest stud book society for ponies registered in Australia. In the 1940s, breeders began crossing Arabian stallions with mares from the APSB.  Australian Ponies are alert, sensible, gentle, and good-tempered animals that are wonderful to work with in a variety of settings and disciplines. When working with these ponies, you will notice that they exhibit a sense of pride, yet they are obedient and easy to train.

The hindquarters are rounded, too, as well as proportioned, and there are strong and flat bones that do not have coarseness. The legs are short, but they are strong, and the hooves are well-shaped, neat, and strong. Also, the tail is straight, well-set, and carried gaily. The Australian Pony is ideal for all levels of riders, including children. The majority of Australian Ponies will be gray, although all other equine colors are possible and acceptable as well. These include grullo, brown, roan, champagne, perlino, cremello, palomino, buckskin, dun, chestnut, white, bay, and black.

Otherwise, you can stick with using a standard equine grooming toolkit as a means to thoroughly clean your pony and bond with your pet. You can start with a curry comb to clean debris and loose hair from your pony\u2019s coat. Use a circular motion all over the body for the best results, and then follow that with a body finishing brush, which is ideal for more sensitive areas like the pony\u2019s legs. You can also remove more debris and excess hair with a dandy brush and shedding blade. These tools, when used together, will ensure your pony\u2019s coat will be as clean as possible. As you groom your pony, use this time as an opportunity to also examine the skin and coat to ensure that everything looks healthy. To clean the delicate face of the Australian Pony, you can simply dampen a soft cloth or a sponge and use that to clean around the eyes and the ears. Then, to keep the tail and the mane healthy and smooth, simply use a tail brush and a mane comb to remove tangles and debris. And you can finish your grooming session by using a hoof pick to clean your pony\u2019s hooves.

There is also a bit of controversy surrounding whether Arabian horses and Barb horses share a single common ancestor, or if the Arabian is a predecessor of Barb horses. In fact, when the Barb Horse arrived in Europe, the breed was initially mistaken for the Arabian Horse, even though barb horses didn\u2019t really share any of the physical characteristics of the Arabian, aside from being similar in size. Barb horses are ideal for general riding. Berber invaders in the early part of the 8th century ended up taking their horses into Europe. There, they bred their horses with Spanish horses and developed the Andalusian Horse. The Barb breed became highly valued throughout Europe after the 14th century. Noble families there had large racing stables. Meanwhile, in England, the breed was utilized to develop the beloved Thoroughbred for horse racing. Like the Arabian Horse, the Barb Horse likely has had a lot of influence on racing equine breeds. It is believed that this breed probably had more influence on racing horses than any other horse breed, but the Barb\u2019s influence could also be seen in several other equine breeds, such as the Appaloosa, the American Quarter Horse, the Mustang, the Paso Fino, and the Argentinian Criollo. Today, the Barb Horse is primarily bred in Spain, Algeria, southern France, and Morocco. There are also different varieties of the Barb Horse, and these include the Moroccan Barb, Tunisian Barb, Abaco Barb, and Algerian Barb. The Barb Horse has a willing personality, so it can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, these animals have been successfully used in both agriculture and the military. They are also ideal horses for general riding, and they can even be used in competitive equine sports. Barb horses are wonderful to work with because they have an eagerness to learn, which makes them easy to train. They are also gentle and docile in nature, making them a wonderful equine companion for horse owners, riders, and trainers of all levels. The Barb Horse likely had a lot of influence on racing breeds. The Barb Horse features a straight or slightly convex profile, and a neck that is slightly arched. You will also notice that these horses showcase flat, upright shoulders. The front of this horse\u2019s body is powerful, with high withers. Also, the hindquarters are sloping, narrow, and rounded, while the back is medium or short in length. You will also note that the croup could be slightly angular or rounded. The tail is set low and, like the mane, it is full. This horse also has slender legs that are clean and hardy, and the feet are durable and narrow, while the hooves are round and small. Barb horses will have ears that are moderate or short in length, and they can be notched at the tip as well. The eyes are expressive, the head will taper towards a small muzzle, and the forehead will be broad. The gait of the Barb Horse allows it to gallop much like a sprinter. These horses also have a high amount of stamina, and they are able to travel over long distances even when food supplies are limited. The breed\u2019s movement is agile, and it is also resistant to droughts. Overall, this horse has an appearance that can be described as smooth and balanced. There is depth of body and neck, a distinctly refined head, well-set and clean legs, and roundness of hip that combine to make this an attractive breed. The Barb Horse has a willing and docile personality. Barb horses are usually solid colored, and common colors for this breed include brown, black, sorrel, chestnut, gray, and bay. The most common color is gray, but shades of buckskin, dun, grullo, and roan are also possible. And the Spanish Barb, in particular, can be found in all equine colors, including tobiano and overo. Grooming the Barb Horse regularly is a great way to bond with your animal, as well as ensure that it will remain healthy and clean. After all, regular grooming sessions will even help to prevent a variety of skin problems and other conditions, such as thrush. If your Barb is involved in dressage, you definitely need to spend extra time thoroughly cleaning and smoothing the coat, including the thick mane and tail. Some of the tools that you should have in your equine grooming kit include a curry comb, a shedding blade, a dandy brush with stiff bristles, a body brush with soft bristles, a hoof pick, a brush specifically for the mane and one for the tail, and a rub rag.

It is believed that the Flemish \u201cGreat Horse\u201d of the medieval era is the predecessor of the Belgian Horse. This is an old equine breed, but these horses improved considerably after 1880. The first Belgian Horse was brought to the United States in 1866. There, it was accepted well but it was not as popular as the Percheron Horse. Belgian horses are beloved for their intelligence and willingness to please. The official studbook for the Belgian Horse was released in the 18th century. Up until the start of the 20th century, there were three types of Belgian horses, and they were known as \u201cThe Grey Horse of Nivelles,\u201d \u201cThe Colossal Horse of Mehaigne,\u201d and \u201cThe Big Horse of Dendre.\u201d The number of Belgian horses declined after World War II, thanks to industrialization and mechanization, but their numbers have been increasing in modern times, thanks to increased interest in this unique and beautiful breed. Belgian horses are beloved for their intelligence, and they are also known for being docile, kind, quiet, and willing to please. They are hard working animals that are loyal, easy to handle, and friendly to their human companions. These animals are still often utilized for draft work that includes pulling carriages, sleighs, and hitches, as well as logging and plowing. However, riding draft horses is becoming more popular as well, and these gentle giants are a pleasure to ride for fun. The Flemish \u201cGreat Horse\u201d of the medieval era is the predecessor of the Belgian Horse. The Belgian Draft Horse has actually held the world record for the largest and tallest horse, and it is the most powerful and strongest of all of the draft equine breeds. Its head, which features eyes that are kind and intelligent in expression, is described as square and light, and its profile is either slightly concave or straight. Also, its neck is muscular and short, and its body is short and deep. The back is broad and short, and the legs are sound, lean, and strong with medium to heavy feathering. This horse breed is also known for its heavy body, short legs that are strong, and thick muscles. Overall, the body has a deep girth, but it is short. In fact, this breed is known for being the most compact yet most massive, as well as the lowest set, widest, and deepest, of all of the equine draft breeds. The Brabant of Europe has been bred to be thick and squat, but American bloodlines of the Belgian Horse are more refined, taller, and almost always chestnut in color with a flaxen tail and mane. These horses have action that is powerful, although it is less high and springy than that of the Percheron or Clydesdale. The Belgian Horse is the one of most powerful equine breeds. The most common colors of the Belgian Horse are roan, black, bay, and chestnut. However, these horses can also be sorrel with white, as well as dun, red roan, and gray, and they can feature black points. Despite the various colors that are possible, the Belgian Draft Horse can most often be recognized instantly, thanks to its beautiful sorrel color, white tail and mane, four white stockings or socks, and white facial markings. As with all other horse breeds, the Belgian Horse needs to be groomed regularly. You should also pay extra attention to the hooves, which should be inspected regularly, as well as cleaned and trimmed on a consistent basis in order to prevent injuries and infections. Standard grooming tools will be sufficient for the Belgian Horse, though you may need to step on a small ladder in order to reach the top of the horse because of its large size. Also, the feathering on the legs of these horses should not be removed or trimmed. A curry comb will remove loose hair, as well as dirt and other debris, from your horse\u2019s coat, while a dandy brush can further remove dirt, mud, and loose hair that remains after using the curry comb. Next, a body finishing brush can be utilized on sensitive areas, such as the face and legs, before you move on to using a mane comb to detangle and smooth out the mane and a tail brush to do the same with the tail. A shedding blade can help remove excess hair from the coat, and a hoof pick will effectively get rid of debris and rocks from the hooves to keep them healthy.", "facts": " Heavy, powerful Horse owners, trainers, and riders with experience, especially those who are not afraid to work with large, powerful horses Patient, docile, kind, hard working, quiet, willing to please, and intelligent", "tags": "belgian draft horse, Belgian Horse, Belgian Horse breed, Brabant, Brabant horse, Clydesdale, flemish great horse, irish draught, irish draught horse, shire, Suffolk Punch, "}, "belgian warmblood horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/belgian-warmblood-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/belgian-warmblood.jpg", "name": "Belgian Warmblood Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "While other countries had warmblood horses for quite some time, Belgium did not create the Belgian Warmblood Horse until the 1900s. This is because the government had sought to protect the purity of Belgium\u2019s draft horse, the Brabant. They essentially banned all breeders from developing any horses that would be used under saddle. However, the increased interest in riding horses recreationally, as well as the increased mechanization in the 1950s, changed things. The government relaxed its restrictions upon breeders, and the Belgian people were finally able to catch up with the warmblood breeders in other countries. The Belgian Warmblood is one of the best jumping breeds in the world. Because Belgium did not have any saddle breeds that were developed there, breeders throughout the country had to import the best mares and stallions from several different equine breeds. However, they did lean towards Holsteiners, Hanoverians, and other medium weight horses instead of using light performance horses like Thoroughbreds and Arabian horses. This is because their goal was to create a warmblood breed that would be an exceptional jumping horse, with dense bones, strong quarters, and powerful limbs, instead of a horse that was built for speed, with delicate limbs. The breeding program in Belgium was a success, and the Belgian Warmblood was created and has become one of the best jumping breeds in the world. Because Belgian Warmblood horses were mainly developed from equine breeds that were known for being hard workers with intelligence and a sensible disposition, these horses feature the same traits. Also, because these horses are intended to be used as performance animals, they are better suited to those riders who have at least a moderate level of experience working with horses. The rider should know how to be in charge of this horse, as it will have a strong personality, so it is not the ideal breed for beginners. Under the care and guidance of the right owner and rider, the Belgian Warmblood Horse is a pleasure to work with, as it is willing to learn, multi-talented, and bright. These animals are loyal and gentle, despite their strong and athletic body, and they are tenacious and willing to work. Belgian Warmbloods are suited to riders with a moderate level of experience. The Belgian Warmblood will feature a breed stamp on the left thigh, especially because these horses are defined more by how they can perform rather than by their overall appearance. Even though there aren\u2019t any specific criteria for the appearance of the Belgian Warmblood Horse, these animals do need to prove their abilities in jumping and in working as riding horses. Generally, these attractive horses will feature a muscular yet compact body, along with good depth. There should be a deep chest, sturdy hooves, and strong legs and quarters. The head should be handsome and well carried, and the feet should be large and sound. These horses will also have facial features that are defined, along with a pair of dark eyes. The chest will be narrow to medium, and there will be well sprung ribs. The neck will be narrow as well, without excessive crest, and the shoulders will be muscular and laid back. The croup should be short and sloping, and the back will be proportionate to the rest of the body. The Belgian Warmblood features a coat that\u2019s finer than that of other breeds. The Belgian Warmblood Horse can feature all of the equine colors. These include spotted and broken colors, but because of the breeding history of these animals, they will almost always feature solid colors instead. Common coat colors amongst Belgian Warmblood horses include brown, chestnut, black, gray, and bay, as well as pinto and tobiano. The Belgian Warmblood Horse features a coat that is much finer than that of other equine breeds. Also, the tail and the mane of this breed will be finer as well. This makes the horse easier to groom, particularly in the winter. However, it also requires that you take extra care to ensure your horse will remain warm in the winter, and that you bring your horse in every night when the weather is cold. Other than that, you will find that a standard grooming practice with your Belgian Warmblood horse will suffice. Equine shampoo and conditioner are typically only necessary when your horse becomes very dirty. Otherwise, you can stick with grooming your horse regularly using tools that include a curry comb, a dandy brush, a shedding blade, a body finishing brush, a mane comb, and a tail brush. These will work on removing excess hair, dirt, and other debris so that the skin and coat will remain clean, smooth, and healthy.

And its origins date back to a time before the Crusades, so this breed has been around for a long time. In fact, according to some experts, these horses are from the Boulogne District in France, and you can trace them all the way back to the animals that were left behind by the cavalry of Julius Caesar prior to invading England. Over time, the Boulonnais horse was bred with several other equine breeds in order to refine it. And this breed has also been used to develop other draft breeds as well. For example, during the 17th century, Andalusian, Arabian, and Spanish Barb horses were bred with the Boulonnais. The Boulonnais has a social and docile personality. Also, originally, this breed had several types as well. For example, the Petit Boulonnais, or Mareyeur, was smaller, coming in at around 15 hands tall, and it was typically used to transport fresh fish. The Picard type was referred to as the \u201chorse of the bad land,\u201d while the Cauchoix horse was referred to as the \u201chorse of the good land.\u201d Finally, the Grand Boulonnais, which could reach 16 hands in height, was bred for working on farms. Over time, the types were bred together and led to the modern type we know today. Boulonnais horses were exported to the United States in the early part of the 1900s, but these animals nearly went extinct in Europe as a result of the wars of the 20th century, and particularly after World War II. Thankfully, the breed was able to make a bit of a comeback in the 1970s in France, but it was because the animals were being used for meat. Today, there aren\u2019t that many Boulonnais horses alive anymore, and the majority of them are found in France. Don\u2019t let the height and strength of the Boulonnais horse intimidate you, as these horses are known for being easy to work with. They are active, social, and energetic as well, making them wonderful companions. And they are also gentle, so they can be around owners and riders of all experience levels, despite their large size. Because these horses are attractive, strong, and capable, and because they have a willing and docile personality and the ability to do a range of tasks, they make great horses for just about anybody. The Boulonnais horse is typically gray in color. These large, elegant horses are refined and stunning in appearance. You will notice that these horses have a head that is short yet distinctive. There is a forehead that is wide, a profile that is straight, and ears that are erect and small. Also, the neck should be muscular and thick, as well as arched gracefully, and the chest should be wide, while the withers should be prominent. Compared to other draft horses, the muscular shoulder has more slope and the tail is set higher. And the back should be straight, while the legs should be solid and strong and feature clean joints. Also, the tail and the mane are a couple of the other lovely features of these horses, as they are described as thick, silky, and luxurious. And you may also note that the skin of the Boulonnais is quite fine too, allowing you to see some veining and giving the horse the appearance of polished marble (hence, the breed\u2019s nickname). The Boulonnais is also referred to as the White Marble Horse. The Boulonnais horse is typically gray in color. However, black and chestnut are also colors that are allowed by the breed registry in France. According to experts, the most common colors for this breed were actually black and bay back in the 18th century. But as the breed\u2019s numbers started to decline, a dominant gray gene caused the other colors to become increasingly rare. Grooming your Boulonnais horse may be a little difficult because these animals are large, but it will be well worth the effort. Not only will you be able to bond with your horse, but you will also help ensure that his lustrous coat and full mane and tail will remain looking healthy and beautiful. When your horse gets too dirty for a basic brushing routine, you could bathe him with a gentle shampoo that is designed for equines. On a regular basis, however, brushing with a curry comb, a dandy brush, a body finishing brush, shedding blade, and a brush for the tail and the mane, should be sufficient, as these will help remove dirt, debris, and loose hair from the coat. You will want to pay special attention to the mane and tail, which are thick, so that you can properly clean them and detangle them so that they will be nice and smooth. Using a moistened soft cloth around the eyes and ears will allow you to clean those delicate areas as well.

But this breed has an unclear history when it comes to its origins. A few theories have been put forth about the first Breton, and it is believed that the breed dates back thousands of years. It is also thought that the first Breton horses were taken to Europe by humans who migrated there. Others theorize that the breed was actually developed by Celtic warriors, and that the breed came from steppe horses used by Celtic people. Beyond all of that, it is believed that the Breton was created by crossbreeding several Oriental and European equine breeds. During the Middle Ages, the Breton horse was sought-after for military use, and the breed was divided into two types. Those types were the Roussin and the Sommier. The Roussin was the version of the Breton that was developed from the Bidet horse, and it featured a body that was more slender. On the other hand, the Sommier was the pack horse of North Brittany in France. The Breton is a draft horse from France. As the breed was further developed, three subtypes of Breton horses came about, and each one hails from a different part of Brittany, France. The Postier Breton is known for having a large body, a great gait, and a refined conformation. The Heavy Draft Breton, or Breton Draft, is more muscular and bulkier. And the Corlay Breton, or Central Mountain Breton, is the shorter type, as well as the one that\u2019s considered the true ancestor of the breed. Through the years, the Breton was crossbred with Boulonnais, Percheron, and Ardenness horses. Since the 1930s, however, stricter breeding programs have been used to prevent crossbreeding. Also, even though a studbook for the breed was created in 1909, it was closed in 1951. Breton horses are typically calm, kind, friendly, easygoing, and talented. They are also known for being lively, adaptable, willing, and noble. All of these characteristics make these horses wonderful companions who are easy to train and easy to work with. Because these horses are versatile and sturdy, they can be used for a wide range of purposes. For example, the smaller horses could be used for light draft work, while larger Bretons could be used for agricultural work. Some people use these horses to pull coaches, while others use them for pleasure riding. And these horses are also bred for their meat in certain countries. Breton horses are friendly and easygoing. The Breton horse is an attractive breed that has a few defining characteristics. For example, the legs, which are feathered, can be described as muscular and short. The back is also short but it is broad. The chest is wide and muscular, and the withers are also muscular. The shoulders are sloping and long, and you will also note a sloping croup, well developed hooves, and broad joints. The neck of the Breton horse is short, well set, and strong, and the nose could be dished or straight. The head is medium in size and well proportioned, and it features a wide forehead. Breton horses are talented and can be used for a variety of tasks. Two of the most commonly seen colors in the Breton horse are red roan and blue roan, but you could also find Bretons that feature a chestnut coat with a mane and tail that are sand colored. And you could even find Breton horses sporting coats that are bay roan, bay, gray, and chestnut. As is the case with any other equine breed, regularly grooming your Breton will be an important step in keeping him happy, healthy, and looking great. Plus, grooming is a great time to bond with your horse. When your horse is too dirty for a basic brushing session, you could bathe him using a gentle shampoo that is formulated specifically for use on horses. But whether you shampoo your horse or not, every grooming session should involve checking the hooves thoroughly for infections and injuries, as well as cleaning the hooves of dirt and debris using a high quality hoof pick. To brush your Breton horse, you will need a few different tools. For example, you could use a curry comb to remove dirt and debris from your horse\u2019s coat with ease, especially if you use the comb in circular motions. Then you could use a dandy brush to remove even more debris that you might have missed, and you could clean sensitive areas like the head and the lower legs using a body brush. Brushes specifically designed for use on the tail and mane will make it easier to remove tangles and keep your horse looking beautiful. And a simple soft cloth that has been moistened with some water could allow you to clean the sensitive areas near the eyes and ears.

It is believed that those two breeds led to the Canadian Horse, which also features similar characteristics to the Andalusian, Barb, and Arabian breeds. And, as a result of being exposed to harsh conditions, including few food sources, Canadian Horses developed into hardy, sturdy animals over time. By the middle of the 1800s, Canadian Horses were found in both Canada and the United States. The horses were used to strengthen other breeds like the Tennessee Walking Horse, American Saddlebred, Standardbred, and Morgan breeds. And Canadian Horses were also exported to the West Indies and southern Africa, and they were used during the Civil War in the U.S. Three subtypes (pacing, trotting, and draft) were established during the time when this breed was most popular, but it is believed that they have all gone extinct since then. The Canadian Horse is powerful and agile. It was not until 1886 that the first studbook was created by individuals who were concerned about keeping the Canadian Horse breed alive. Then, in 1895, the Canadian Horse Breeders Association was founded. Canada is proud of this horse breed as well. For example, this horse was named the country\u2019s national breed by the Canadian Parliament in 1909. Much later, in 2002, the Canadian Horse became an official animal symbol for the country, And in 2010, Quebec\u2019s provincial legislature named the Canadian Horse a heritage breed as well. Unfortunately, this breed is still considered critical according to the American Livestock Conservancy. Canadian Horses are beautiful, strong horses that are known for being spirited and full of energy, as well as powerful. They are not known for being nervous horses; instead, they are considered docile and calm, so they are a good choice for all levels of horse owners and riders. Because these horses are brave, energetic, and smart, as well as multi-talented and versatile, they can be used for everything from work and jumping, to hunting and endurance riding. The Canadian Horse dates back to the late 1600s. The strong Canadian Horse features a head that is carried high and is straight but rather short. The ears are thin, short, active, and set well apart, while the forehead is flat and broad. The eyes, too, are wide apart, as well as large, active, and bright. The neck is arched, with a top that is thin and a base that is broad, and it is of medium length and firmly muscled.

Overall, this equine breed is powerful and agile, thanks to its proportioned and balanced body. The Canadian Horse is multi-talented and versatile. Unlike other equine breeds, which could feature a variety of colors, patterns, and markings, the Canadian Horse does not showcase a wide array of coat colors. Instead, you can primarily find Canadian Horses sporting dark colored coats that include dark brown, bay, chestnut, or black. Chestnuts are more rare, though, and they may even feature flaxen tails and manes. And, rarely, these horses may even feature a gray coat. The Canadian Horse features a coat that is shiny and soft. The long and thick mane is also beautiful and fun to groom, and spending time grooming your horse will also be a great opportunity to bond with your equine companion.

Considering the large amount of shipwrecks that occurred in the area, and the fact that ponies were often transported to South America or to the American colonies, the evidence is likely to be true. Chincoteague ponies come from a feral colony of horses. By the 1700s, pony penning occurred annually on Assateague Island. This was the method used by livestock owners to not only claim and brand, but also break and harness loose herds. There is no mention of pony penning occurring on Chincoteague Island until the middle of the 1800s. However, the penning did continue for years on both islands, and it still goes on today. Every year, the Chincoteague ponies in Virginia are made to swim across the channel so that foals can be auctioned off and the stallions and mares can be returned. Those ponies that reside on the Virginia side of the island are owned by the Chincoteague fire department, while the ponies that are on the Maryland side of the island are owned by the state\u2019s park service. In 1939, in order to try to prevent inbreeding from occurring within the pony herd, 20 wild Mustang horses were allowed to roam into the Virginia herd. The Arabian, Shetland Pony, and Welsh Pony were also introduced to the Chincoteague Pony breeding colonies, so the traits of those breeds are still evident in the pony today. It was not until 1994 that the Chincoteague Pony finally became recognized as an official registered equine breed. Chincoteague ponies come from a feral colony of horses that live on their own. Therefore, these animals will be independent by nature. The good news, however, is that once they are successfully domesticated, Chincoteague ponies are friendly, easy to maintain, and easy to keep as a family pet. These ponies do quite well as show horses in a wide range of disciplines, but they can also be used for pleasure riding and driving. They can even be used as sports ponies in hunting. Because of their safe demeanor and sociable nature, Chincoteague ponies make great equine companions for children, in particular. The Chincoteague Pony has a round, large belly because of its diet. Chincoteague ponies are small and stocky, with short legs that are slender. The head will be small but it will have a refined appearance. The eyes will be wide apart and small, the joints will be strong, and the feet will be tough. These ponies also feature a belly that is round and large. The reason for this bloated appearance is because these horses drink twice as much water as other horses. They also eat grass found within marshes, so their diet is rich in salt. Overall, this pony breed\u2019s modern appearance has been shaped by the island environment that it lives in. As a result, these horses have a thick mane and a thick tail, along with strong hooves and light fetlock feathering. Once domesticated, Chincoteague ponies are friendly and easy to keep. The Chincoteague Pony breed showcases many different equine colors. These include bay, chestnut, gray, dun, black, brown, cremello, and palomino. The most common pattern is pinto, but tobiano and overo are also common. Some of the brighter patterns include strawberry roan on white, as well as palomino on white. Shampooing, conditioning, and thoroughly combing your Chincoteague Pony will be necessary on a regular basis in order to keep the animal\u2019s skin and coat clean, healthy, shiny, and smooth. Consistent grooming, particularly with a tail brush and a mane comb, will also ensure the thick mane and tail remain beautiful and tangle free. Use every grooming session as an opportunity to bond with your pony, who will thoroughly enjoy the attention. Use tools like a dandy brush, curry comb, body finishing brush, and shedding blade to completely remove loose hair, dirt, and debris from the coat, as well as smooth it out.

It is the result of crossing packhorses, which were hardy, with refined breeds like the Arabian, Thoroughbred, Barb, and Andalusian. The goal was to have a refined horse that would be able to pull carriages. In order to make it easier to match pairs of horses, and to make them suitable for use during any occasion, all of the horses were bred so that they would be bay in color. This also distinguished the Cleveland Bays from white horses that were considered unsuitable for more somber occasions, as well as black horses, which would not be suitable for festive occasions. The Cleveland Bay was bred to be a hard working and devoted horse. The Cleveland Bay Horse became the preferred carriage horse for wealthy individuals, and they are still utilized today for royal carriages. However, they were in highest demand throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, when they were used as cavalry horses as well. As a result of being used in the cavalry, however, many of these horses died with their riders, and by the conclusion of World War I, the number of Cleveland Bays had dropped considerably. This resulted in efforts to protect the animals, which were largely unsuccessful as a result of the depression in the 1930s, World War II, and the overall decline in horse-drawn carriages. However, Queen Elizabeth II purchased one of the four purebred Cleveland Bay stallions that remained in the UK in 1962. That stallion\u2019s descendants helped to revive the breed, and Prince Philip began using them in driving competitions as well. Today, stud books are maintained by the Cleveland Bay Horse Society of North America, which was founded in 1885, and the British Cleveland Bay Horse Society, which was founded in 1883. The Cleveland Bay Horse was bred to be a hard working and devoted horse, so it is an honest worker that is highly versatile and intelligent. The breed is also renowned for being able to cope well in traffic when properly trained for those types of situations and environments. These horses make wonderful riding companions for all levels of riders, including beginners who are seeking to gain experience. They are a great option for teens who are taller and unable to ride ponies but are seeking a docile horse to learn how to ride properly and safely. Cleveland Bays have high amounts of strength and stamina. The Cleveland Bay Horse has a body that is deep and wide and that provides the animal with strength and stamina. Although the back is strong and the loins are muscular, the back shouldn\u2019t be too long. Also, the shoulders are muscular, deep, and sloping, the quarters are powerful, long, oval, and level, and the tail should spring well from the horse\u2019s quarters. A Cleveland Bay\u2019s head will not be too small, and it will be bold in appearance. The horse should carry the head well on a lean, long neck. The eyes should be well set, kind in their expression, and large as well. The ears are also fine and large. This horse\u2019s legs should appear muscular, and the pasterns are sloping, not too long, and strong. Also, the legs of this breed should not have superfluous hair, and they should be as hard and as clean as possible. Finally, the horse\u2019s feet, which are one of the breed\u2019s most vital features, should be blue in color, and they should not be narrow or shallow. The Cleveland Bay has a bay colored coat with black points. The Cleveland Bay only features a lovely bay colored coat with black points. This means that the horse will have black legs, a black tail, and a black mane. A very small white star is also permitted, but no other white is allowed. Horses may also feature legs that are red or bay below the hocks and knees. Rarely, you will also find a Cleveland Bay with a chestnut colored coat. Every Cleveland Bay benefits from a daily grooming session, which is strongly recommended because it will effectively stimulate the horse\u2019s blood flow, in addition to keeping the horse clean and smooth. Regular checkups with a farrier are also highly recommended to keep the hooves clean and healthy. Use every grooming session to deepen the bond that you share with your beloved equine companion. Also check your horse thoroughly, from head to tail, for any injuries or infections. Consistent grooming sessions will effectively remove loose, dead hair, as well as dirt, mud, and other debris that can accumulate on your Cleveland Bay\u2019s coat while spending time in the great outdoors. Every six weeks, the horse will require shoeing, and you should shampoo and condition your horse regularly too.

These horses were bred by John Paterson, a breeder, and the 6th Duke of Hamilton, who wanted to create a breed of horses that would have well-proportioned, large hooves and strong, steady legs. These features would allow the horses to easily navigate along the cobblestone roads in the area. To create this breed, they started by transporting six Flemish and Fresian stallions that would mate with the local mares. This breeding program created horses that were strong and powerful, and non-locals began referring to these animals as the Clydesman\u2019s Horses. The Clydesdale Horse is one of the most beloved horse breeds, thanks to its unique appearance and wonderful personality. Once the coal industry began to establish itself in the area, farmers realized that they could also use these horses for hauling loads of materials for coal mining and road improvement. As a result, these animals were also bred so that they would be able to effectively pull carts for local coal mines. It was not until 1826 that the Clydesman\u2019s Horse became formally known as the Clydesdale. And by the middle of 1877, the breed was so popular that the Clydesdale Horse Society was founded. A couple of years later, the Clydesdale Breeders of the United States was also established. Even though this horse breed remained popular, it almost went extinct when machines started replacing draft horses during the Industrial Revolution. But, thanks to marketing campaigns from beer brands like Budweiser, interest in the breed stayed strong.

Mike Ruby, a horse enthusiast who was born in Ontario, Canada, is the founder of this breed. He bred two horses of Arabian and Barb ancestry and then showcased two of the offspring at the National Western Stock Show in the 1930s in Denver, Colorado. Once the horses were seen, curiosity from the public ensued. The breed was officially created in 1934, and it was named after its origins in the Colorado High Plains. The Colorado Ranger Horse is also known as the Rangerbred. Even though they look similar, the Colorado Ranger Horse isn\u2019t a type of Appaloosa Horse. Instead, it is its own distinct breed with a distinct heritage. In fact, in order for a horse to be classified as a Colorado Ranger Horse, there must be pedigree documentation that proves that the horse\u2019s heritage goes back to the first two horses bred by Mike Ruby. But the Colorado Ranger Horse\u2019s ancestry dates even further back than Mike Ruby. General Ulysses S. Grant went to see Sultan Abdul Hamid in Turkey in 1878 while he was on a tour of the world. Before the General left, the Sultan showed his respect by giving him two stallions. One was an Arabian named Leopard and the other was a Barb whose name was Linden Tree. First, these two horses traveled to Virginia in 1879. There, Randolph Huntington started using them as the foundation sires for a new light harness horse breed. The project, however, was discontinued once the horseless carriage became popular. As a result, the horses were sent to the west. They spent some time in Nebraska, where they had offspring with native mares at Colby Ranch. The offspring already started drawing attention from breeders in the west, and A.C. Whipple of Colorado was able to get mares from Colby Ranch that were sired by either Leopard or Linden Tree. Along with a white stallion known as Tony, the Whipples created an extensive breeding program. Then Mike Ruby ended up purchasing two horses that would go on to serve as the foundation for the new Colorado Ranger Horse breed. After the Colorado Ranger Horse became an official breed in 1934, Mike Ruby served as the president of the Colorado Ranger Horse Association until 1942. Colorado Ranger horses are bold, clever, and intelligent. They are also described as multi-talented because they are able to perform a variety of tasks, from endurance riding and general riding, to various work tasks.

It is believed that the ancestors of today\u2019s Connemara Pony were ponies that were similar in appearance to the Shetland Pony and Norwegian Fjord. The Connemara Pony is Ireland\u2019s only native breed. It is also believed that Spanish horses were used to develop the Connemara Pony in the 16th century after Spanish Armada ships ran aground and sank in 1588. The Andalusian horses that were aboard the ship swam to the shore and ended up breeding with the native, wild ponies. In order to make the Connemara Pony even stronger, and to give the ponies much more stamina, Arabians were bred with the ponies in the 1700s. The ponies were also bred with Thoroughbreds and Hackneys. Because the pony bloodlines were diluted as a result of too much crossbreeding, however, the Connemara Pony Breeders\u2019 Society was established in 1923.

In fact, its origin is considered one of the biggest mysteries within the equine world. Some experts believed that the Russian Bashkir, which is a horse breed from Bashkortostan that features a curly coat, was an ancestor of today\u2019s Curly Horse, but research proved that the theory was inaccurate. Other theories suggested that the Curly Horse may have arrived in North America when it crossed the Bering Land Bridge during the Ice Age. And still other theories stated that Russian settlers took these horses to North America with them. The Curly Horse is social, curious, and enjoys being around people. Many believe that Curly horses were actually recorded as far back as the 2nd century in Asian artwork. And another theory suggests that Curly horses were taken to Nevada from India by Tom Dixon in the latter part of the 19th century. However, those individual horses couldn\u2019t have served as the foundation stock for this breed because curly horse breeds were owned by Sioux Indians in the early part of the 1800s. And yet another theory suggests that the horses arrived in America with Spanish conquistadors, thereby implying that the breed has an Iberian ancestry. In the end, though, there isn\u2019t enough evidence to totally support any of these claims. The first time that Curly horses were documented in Nevada was in the early 1900s, with the help of John Damele. The horses were rare, but after several years, he and his sons were able to capture one, tame it, and sell it. Impressed by the horse\u2019s toughness and resiliency, particularly when it came to handling harsh winters, the Dameles decided that they would breed the horses, and they located a Curly within a herd of Mustangs that would become the foundation stallion for the breed. The breeders eventually introduced an Arabian stallion and a Morgan horse to the Curly herd as well. The Curly Horse breed was formally established and registered in 1971. The Curly Horse is social, friendly, curious, and good-natured, and this breed also enjoys being around people. These horses are quite popular because they are easy to train and intelligent.

The Curly Horse\u2019s origin is one of the biggest mysteries in the equine world. The Curly Horse will feature a head that is medium in size, along with a well-defined jaw. The neck should be a medium length, and it should be deep at its base where it will join the shoulder base. This horse\u2019s back will be obviously short because there are five lumbar vertebrae, but it will be deep and strong. The eyes will be set wide, and you will notice that the eyelashes curl upward. Also, the ears should be medium or short in length, and they will also have curls on the inside. You will notice that the withers are medium in size, the croup is flat, and the legs feature heavy bones, with a short cannon bone. The hooves should be nearly perfectly round, dense, hard, and proportionate to the overall size of the animal. What is most distinctive about this horse, however, is its soft and fine hair, which could be hypoallergenic. Also, the horse could totally shed the tail and/or the mane during the summer, but it will grow back in the autumn along with the animal\u2019s winter coat. The coat can either be categorized as Ringlet, in which the hair will be a few inches long, as a Marcel Wave, which will be a soft and deep wave within the body coat, or as Crushed Velvet, which will showcase a dense and soft pile of curls within the body coat. The mane will feature hair that is extra fine, and it can be kinky or wavy. It should shed partially or completely in the summer season, and the mane should hang down on both sides of this horse\u2019s neck. The tail will be wavy or Ringlet, shed partially at the head in the summer, or shed completely. Also, the Curly Horse will have wavy or curly fetlocks, and these should shed in the summer while retaining some of the longer hairs. The Curly Horse features a hypoallergenic coat. The Curly Horse breed can feature a variety of equine coat colors. These include grullo, roan, cremello, buckskin, black, white, gray, and bay.

The curly coat of this unique equine breed can be challenging at first, but once you learn the right routine, you\u2019ll find that grooming your Curly Horse is as enjoyable as grooming any other breed. Just keep in mind that curly coats that are dense will collect everything from hay and manure, to mud and other debris easily, so grooming regularly will keep the coat clean and healthy. Helpful grooming tools for curly coats include a paddle brush and a medium stiff brush. You can tame static with an apple cider vinegar spray.

The withers aren\u2019t too fine, and the hindquarters should be powerful, deep, and lengthy. The tail is not set high, and it has straight, long hair that could reach the ground. Also, the hocks will be clean, flat, and broad, while the forearms will be muscular, short, and set square. The Dales Pony features flexible joints, and the pasterns will slope nicely and be of a good length. There will also be silky feathering on the heels, and the hooves will be dark colored, round, and large. Dales ponies feature a quiet but bold temperament. A Dales pony will typically feature a brown, gray, roan, bay, or black coat. Black is the most common color for this equine breed. It is also possible to find a Dales pony with a white star or a white snip on the head, as well as white fetlocks to the hind legs. You should groom your Dales pony throughout the year, but especially in the winter, when these horses grow thicker coats. A standard equine grooming kit will be sufficient to keep the coat and hooves free of debris, dirt, mud, and even excess hair that can lead to tangles and a dull appearance. Using a curry comb, dandy brush, shedding blade, and body finishing brush should be adequate enough to thoroughly remove dirt, debris, and loose hair from your pony\u2019s coat throughout every season, regardless of how thick the coat becomes. Dales ponies feature long, straight, and flowing manes and tails that require extra attention to keep them looking beautiful and clean, and to keep them free of tangles. Using an equine shampoo and the right brushes will ensure that you can keep the mane and the tail conditioned, hydrated, shiny, and sleek. Always make it a point to properly comb through, clean, and detangle the tail, which is allowed to grow very long, to the point that it can even reach the ground. Finally, you should also spend a few minutes checking the health of the hooves and the hair that surrounds the hooves in order to ensure that no injuries or infections develop there.

The pony got its name from a wild portion of moorland that is called Dartmoor. This area is more than 1,000 feet above sea level, making the weather of Dartmoor intense and its terrain rocky with minimal vegetation. As a result of these living conditions, the Dartmoor Pony evolved to be a hardy and sure-footed horse with plenty of stamina and an adaptability that allows it to survive in a variety of conditions. Dartmoor ponies have lived in that area for centuries, and because the breed developed over time on the moor and tough terrain, these ponies are still known for their high endurance level and strength. Dartmoor ponies are strong enough for adults to ride them. The history of the Dartmoor Pony could be traced all the way back to the Bronze age, when hoof prints, presumably of domestic animals and possibly of the Dartmoor Pony, were found on Shaugh Moor. Also, one of the earliest references ever recorded about the Dartmoor Pony is within the will of a Saxon Bishop named Awifwold of Crediton, who passed away in 1012. During the medieval era, these ponies were utilized in order to transport tin from mines across the moors. To make this pony breed even more efficient, breeders started diluting the bloodline by cross breeding the animals with Shetland ponies. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dartmoor Pony breed suffered as a result, but after the area\u2019s mines were shut down, the animals were set free on the moor again. It was not until 1898 that attempts were made to preserve and register the Dartmoor Pony breed. A stud book was formed in 1924, when the first registry for the Dartmoor Pony was also developed. Although these ponies suffered during World War I and World War II, efforts were made by locals to ensure the breed\u2019s survival. Today, the Dartmoor Pony Moorland Scheme and the Dartmoor Pony Society have breeding programs that have helped to increase the number of ponies. These horses are now being raised throughout Australia, Europe, the United States, and other small countries. The Dartmoor Pony is medium in height, so it is ideal for children. However, these ponies are also strong enough for adults to ride them. Their movement is smooth, and they can be used for a variety of purposes because they are adaptable and versatile. On top of that, these ponies make wonderful companions, thanks to their understanding disposition and their intelligence. These animals are even-tempered and kind, as well as reliable, gentle, and calm. They are a pleasure to work with and they are a wonderful addition to any family with children who wish to have a horse to call their own. The Dartmoor Pony evolved to be a hardy and sure-footed horse. Dartmoor ponies are attractive horses that feature a small head, eyes that are set widely apart, and ears that are alert and sharp. The throat and the jaw should be finely set, and the neck should be of medium length. This pony\u2019s shoulders will be slightly sloping and laid back, but they are not pronounced too much at the withers. Also, the body is small overall, but it is medium in length and it has a deep girth. A Dartmoor pony\u2019s hindquarters will be well muscled and noticeably strong. The tail, which is full flowing, will be set high, and there will be a full and flowing mane as well. Dartmoor ponies are even-tempered, kind, and ideal for children. The Dartmoor Pony can showcase a variety of beautiful equine colors, except pinto. These commonly include black, gray, chestnut, bay, and roan. Skewbald and piebald, as well as excessive white markings, are also seen on some of these ponies, although they would not be considered for registration. Dartmoor ponies enjoy being around people, and they are gentle creatures, so they will enjoy every grooming session that you can provide. While shampooing and conditioning your pony is usually only necessary when your pet becomes very dirty, a standard equine grooming practice will ensure that the pony\u2019s skin and coat will remain clean and healthy. Also, if you use a hoof pick to clean out your pony\u2019s hooves at the end of each grooming session, you can also ensure that the hooves are in good condition, without any injuries or infections developing. Use a curry comb, shedding blade, dandy brush, and body finishing brush to move from the head to the tail and clean all of the excess hair, debris, and dirt that has accumulated in your pony\u2019s coat. The hair should be easy to smooth out with these tools, but you can concentrate on keeping the mane and the tail flowing and tangle-free by using a mane comb and a tail brush as well. And when cleaning sensitive areas, such as around the eyes and ears, you can use a dampened cloth rather than a brush.", "facts": " Small, well-defined All levels of horse owners, riders, and trainers, including children Even-tempered, kind, calm, gentle, reliable, understanding, intelligent, alert", "tags": "child-friendly pony, dartmoor pony, english pony, pony breed, Shetland Pony, "}, "dutch warmblood horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/dutch-warmblood-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dutch-warmblood.jpg", "name": "Dutch Warmblood Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "Today\u2019s Dutch Warmblood Horse, also known as the Dutch Riding Horse, evolved from the Groningen Horse and the Gelderlander Horse, which are two Dutch breeds. The Groningen Horse evolved in northern Holland, on heavy clay soil, and it became a heavier and bigger horse that often displays a black coat. On the other hand, the Gelderlander evolved on light, sandy soil found in central Holland, and its medium sized body frequently showcases a chestnut coat with white markings. Prior to World War II in the Netherlands, the Groningen Horse was used for agricultural purposes, while the Gelderlander Horse was used for drawing carriages. By the middle of the 20th century, the popularity of both breeds declined with the introduction of cars, agricultural machinery, and tractors. Therefore, breeders started specialized breeding programs and carefully selected horses for it. Dutch Warmblood horses are known for their appealing personality. Horses were imported in order to be bred with the Dutch horses, and in the 1960s, breeds including the Gelderlander, Groningen, Holsteiner, and Hanoverian were crossed. The result was the Dutch Warmblood Horse. Two registries, the Gelderlander Horse Studbook and the NWP, were combined in 1969 in order to create the Warmblood Paardenstamboak Nederland, or WPN. It was renamed Koninklijk Warmblood Paardenstamboek Nederland (KWPN) in 1988. Today, there are three breeding directions for KWPN horses. These include the Gelders type, the Riding type (which is divided into Dressage and Jumper types), and the Harness type. KWPN in North America recognizes the Hunter type as well. Dutch Warmblood horses are known for their appealing personality. These animals are willing to work hard, are highly reliable and intelligent, and are appropriate for a variety of riding and sporting events. Another characteristic that makes these horses popular is the fact that they are even-tempered and calm. They can work in a variety of environments while remaining harmonious with their rider because they are in tune with the needs of their rider. These personality traits make the Dutch Warmblood Horse a wonderful equine companion to trainers, owners, and riders of all levels. The Dutch Warmblood Horse is willing to work hard, and is reliable and intelligent. The Dutch Warmblood Horse is an attractive sport horse that features a well-shaped head with a straight profile. You will also notice that this horse has a strong, arched, and fairly long neck, and the tail is set high as well. Dutch Warmblood horses also feature a strong, short, and straight back, along with a full and deep chest. These animals have strong hindquarters and sloping shoulders, short cannon bones, and fairly long, powerful legs. The withers is prominent, and can either be higher than the horse\u2019s loins or level with the loins, helping these horses in both jumping and dressage. All of these physical characteristics combine to give this horse breed fast action, a strong athletic ability, good trainability, soundness, and good stamina. Dutch Warmblood horses are in tune with the needs of their rider. The Dutch Warmblood is an equine breed that features an array of colors that include brown, black, chestnut, gray, and bay. In fact, all solid colors are found in this breed. White markings are also common on the Dutch Warmblood Horse, and the tobiano pattern is often seen as well. Grooming your Dutch Warmblood Horse on a regular basis is just as important as spending time training and riding the horse for whatever activities you choose to pursue with your equine companion. Every grooming session will serve to strengthen your bond with your horse, and this will help the animal work even better with you, the rider. Hoof inspections and cleanings should be done daily in order to prevent injuries and infections, and show horses should also be groomed daily, although brushing can be done weekly for horses that are not in shows. Regular grooming sessions will keep a Dutch Warmblood Horse looking beautiful and clean, and standard equine grooming tools are all that you need. In addition to brushing, however, it is also helpful to bathe your horse on a regular basis to ensure all mud, dirt, and debris is removed from the skin and coat. Use a curry comb, a shedding blade, and a dandy brush in order to effectively remove loose hair and debris from your horse\u2019s coat. A body finishing brush is a good tool to have on hand for use on sensitive areas of the body, such as on the legs and face. Use a mane comb specifically on the mane, as well as a tail comb on the tail, to ensure these hairs can effectively be detangled and smoothed out. Complete every grooming session by using a hoof pick, which will remove debris, such as rocks, from the animal\u2019s hooves and help prevent problems before they occur.

Evidence that dates back more than 60,000 years shows striking similarities between those ancient horses and today\u2019s Exmoor Pony. And it is even believed that these ponies are descendants of horses that made their way into Britain before it became an island. Over time, the Exmoor Pony had to become increasingly hardier and stronger so that the breed could survive on its own in a climate that was wet and cold. Then, when humans started using these ponies, they were traditionally used for the herding and tending of livestock. However, these ponies could also perform well when it comes to giving both children and adults rides, and they have become good at dressage, driving, and jumping as well. The Exmoor Pony is a rare and endangered breed. In the 1950s, the first Exmoor ponies were imported into North America. Today, it is considered a rare and endangered equine breed, as it is believed that there are only 800 of these ponies left around the world. Exmoor ponies are fast learners, and they enjoy working. They are also considered kind, even-tempered, smart, and alert animals that get along well with everyone, including children and adults. In fact, because of their size, they could be a great choice if you are in search of a child\u2019s pony. However, they are strong enough to support the weight of a small adult as well. Exmoor ponies are kind, even-tempered, and smart. There are a couple of features that make the Exmoor Pony easier to recognize. First, there is the \u201ctoad eye,\u201d which is a heavy upper brow that is able to protect this pony\u2019s eyes from harsh rain and wind. Then, there is the \u201csnow chute\u201d (also known as the \u201cice tail\u201d). This is the group of coarse, short hairs that are found at the top of the pony\u2019s tail in order to move snow and rain down and away from the animal\u2019s body. Every summer, the snow chute is shed but it grows back every Autumn. When looking at an Exmoor Pony, you will also notice that the eyes are pronounced and large, the jaw is deep, the forehead is broad, and the ears are small. The ribs are well sprung and the body is deep, while the legs will be clean and short. Also, the hooves will be well shaped, hard, and neat, and the joints will be well developed. The tail and mane are long and thick. Like other pony breeds that live in cold conditions, the Exmoor Pony features a shiny and sleek coat in the summer, but in the winter, these animals grow a double layer coat in order to enjoy extra waterproofing and insulation in wintry conditions. Their winter coat consists of an underlayer that is woolly and insulating, along with a top layer that features longer hairs that are oily and serve to protect the undercoat by keeping it from getting waterlogged. When it rains, for example, the hairs allow water to move down the sides of the pony, and you\u2019ll notice that the water falls from several drip areas on the body. The Exmoor Pony features an \u201cice tail\u201d and \u201ctoad eye.\u201d The colors for the Exmoor Pony include variations of dun, brown, or bay with black points. You will also notice mealy markings around the eyes and on the muzzle, as well as on the underbelly and flanks. These ponies will not have any white markings. Grooming your Exmoor pony should be no different than grooming any other pony or horse. You could start by checking the hooves and cleaning them out with a hoof pick after making sure that they aren\u2019t injured or infected. Whenever it is necessary because your pony is too dirty, you could bathe him using a gentle equine shampoo. Otherwise, you could use a curry comb to remove any debris, such as mud, that has gotten stuck on the pony\u2019s coat. Use your curry comb in a circular motion but don\u2019t use it on sensitive areas like the head and lower legs. After you\u2019ve removed all of the dirt and debris with your curry comb, you could switch to a dandy brush to remove loose dust from the coat by using swiping and flicking motions. Next, you could use a body brush on the lower legs and the head, as this is a gentler tool that could further polish the coat and remove all of the remaining dust and dirt that you might have missed up to this point. Finally, to clean around your pony\u2019s delicate eyes and ears, you could use a soft, damp cloth. And to keep the mane and the tail looking lustrous and tangle-free, you could simply use a mane comb and tail brush.", "facts": " Strong, balanced, small, stocky All levels of horse owners and riders, including children Intelligent, willing, talented, kind, alert", "tags": "dartmoor pony, Exmoor Pony, horse breed, pony, pony breed, Shetland Pony, Welsh Pony, "}, "falabella miniature horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/falabella-miniature-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/falabella-miniature-horse.jpg", "name": "Falabella Miniature Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "It is believed that the Falabella Miniature Horse of Argentina was a descendant of Spanish Barb and Andalusian horses that were taken to the area by Spaniards in the 15th century when they intended on conquering the country. After they were defeated, their horses were left behind to roam freely, and over the course of several centuries, the horses had to adapt. Inbreeding and having to survive in a new harsh environment resulted in horses that were physically smaller but extremely strong. In the 1840s, the small horses were observed within equine herds by Patrick Newell. He began to create a new herd using the smallest horses that he could find, and selective breeding was then started in order to establish a true small horse breed. Patrick shared what he knew with his son-in-law, Juan Falabella, and then the Falabella family continued to impart their knowledge to future generations. The Falabella Miniature is easy to handle, easy to train, and highly intelligent. Over the course of many years, the Falabella family used a range of equine breeds, including the Argentine Criollo Horse, Appaloosa, and Pinto. They made sure to keep the best and smallest horses within every generation as they sought to create the Falabella Miniature that is beloved today. In fact, some of the smallest horses in the world were bred by Julio Falabella, and these perfect tiny horses were born in all equine colors. It was not until the 1960s that Julio Falabella was ready to send the Falabella Miniature Horse to the United States and other nations. News quickly spread about this new miniature horse breed, which was centuries in the making and resulted from both natural and selective breeding across several generations. As a result, the horses continued to spread around the world as people sought to purchase them. The Falabella Miniature Horse finally became a registered equine breed in the 1970s, with the creation of the Falabella Miniature Horse Association. Today, these horses are still found at the Falabella Farm, located in Argentina, but they are also found throughout the United States, Europe, Canada, the UK, and many other countries. The Falabella Miniature Horse has a sweet personality, and this breed enjoys spending time around people of all ages. These animals are also able to adapt to situations and environments easily, and they are friendly, gentle, and docile, so they are ideal for beginners and children. Because of their size, these horses are easy to handle, and they are also easy to train and highly intelligent, so they make wonderful family pets and equine companions for people of all experience levels. Even though the Falabella Miniature is small, it\u2019s surprisingly strong. Even though the Falabella Miniature Horse is small, it is surprisingly strong. In fact, their strength is similar to horses that are much larger than they are. Also, because this is a true horse breed and not a pony breed, these horses have retained the proportions and structure of full-size horses. However, unlike other equine breeds, Falabella horses have only 17 vertebrae instead of 18, and also have at least one less pair of ribs when compared to their larger counterparts. The Falabella Miniature enjoys being around people of all ages. Falabella Miniature horses come in every equine solid color, as well as a range of equine patterns. Common colors include brown, black, chestnut, and bay, and pintos are also often seen. Pintaloosa patterns are possible, though they are rare, and black or red spotted horses are also uncommon. Grooming is a great way to bond with your Falabella Miniature horse, especially since these animals really enjoy being around people. Every grooming session can serve to reinforce your bond with your horse, and it also gives you the chance to look for any problems with your horse\u2019s hooves, teeth, skin, and coat before they escalate. It is a good idea to groom your Falabella Miniature horse at least weekly. You can also employ a farrier every six to eight weeks in order to have the animal\u2019s hooves trimmed in an effort to prevent problems. Simply put together a standard horse grooming kit so you can have all of the tools necessary to maintain the health and beauty of your companion\u2019s coat. You can use a curry comb to remove dirt and debris, especially if it has become tangled within the horse\u2019s hair or it is stuck onto the skin. Following that with a body brush, or even a soft brush for sensitive horses, will allow you to easily get rid of any excess debris that was loosened but not removed by the curry comb. To gently detangle your horse\u2019s mane and tail, use the appropriate combs for each, and only use something like a grooming cloth around delicate areas like the eyes and ears. Also, don\u2019t forget to maintain the health of the horse\u2019s hooves by using a hoof pick to thoroughly remove debris, such as rocks and mud, in between visits with the farrier.", "facts": " Small, proportionate All levels of horse owners and trainers, including children Friendly, docile, able to adapt easily, trainable, intelligent, enjoys human companionship", "tags": "Falabella, Falabella Horse, Falabella Miniature, Falabella Miniature Horse, mini horse, Miniature Horse, miniature horse breed, small horse, tiny horse, "}, "fell pony": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/fell-pony/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fell-pony.jpg", "name": "Fell Pony", "type": "horse", "text": "The Fell Pony is an equine breed that is native to England, particularly in the north and mostly in Cumbria, and it was bred originally on northwest England\u2019s fell farms. It is believed that this is probably where the ponies roamed even during pre-historic times. In Britain, by the time of the Iron Age, horses were commonly used in a variety of ways every day. The ponies, in particular, averaged 12.1 hands high, and in terms of their overall build, they looked a lot like the Exmoor equine breed. Later, the average height of the ponies in Britain increased to about 13 hands high. Fell ponies prefer to engage in activities that stimulate their curiosity. Fell ponies were also used by the Vikings for work and riding, and these horses were kept in villages, while the breeding stock lived on the fell. During the 11th and 12th centuries, these ponies were utilized for various purposes, and by the 13th century, they were utilized to transport products throughout the country. The Fell Pony became increasingly popular because it was fast, a steady walker, and strong, but it was also small enough that it could be loaded easily. As industrialization continued, these ponies were used to transport a variety of goods, and the Fell Pony was used until the 20th century for moving machinery above ground and in mines underground. By the latter part of the 19th century, pony breeders started to record pedigrees. It was not until 1898 that the first Fell ponies were registered as part of the Polo and Riding Pony Stud Book. To keep the old pony breed pure, the Fell Pony Society was established in 1922, especially because cross breeding was occurring. Today, the popularity of the Fell Pony breed continues to increase, and the number of the ponies that are registered has steadily risen in the first 10 years of the 21st century alone. The Fell Pony is a popular breed because it has an attractive temperament that is similar to other native pony breeds from Britain. These ponies have a strong survival instinct, and they are curious, intelligent, and mischievous. However, it is important to understand that every Fell Pony will have its own temperament, as they are all individuals with unique personalities. These ponies prefer to engage in activities that will stimulate their curiosity and their mind, so they enjoy having a job to do. Sensible training is required, but you need to create a partnership, or a cooperative relationship, with your pony for the best results. Children and small adults can ride these ponies, and they have an easy and comfortable gait. Fell ponies were used by the Vikings. The Fell Pony features a head that is chiseled and small, with a broad forehead and tapering to the nose. The nostrils are large, the ears are well formed, small, and neatly set, and the eyes are bright, intelligent, mild, and prominent. This pony\u2019s neck is of a proportionate length with the rest of the body, and it is strong but not too heavy. You will also note that the pony\u2019s shoulders are sloping, well laid back, and muscular. The hind legs are notably muscular, and the hocks are clean cut. The hooves are of a good size, well formed, and round. There is a lot of fine hair at the heels, and the tail and mane are allowed to grow bushy, thick, and long. Children and small adults can ride Fell ponies. The Fell Pony breed features several colors. These include brown, black, gray, pale gray, bay, and chestnut. White markings, such as a small amount of white on the hind pasterns, as well as white stars, are also possible on the Fell Pony\u2019s coat. However, over 50% of the population of this breed does not have any white markings. In the second half of the 1900s, the predominant color of the breed was black. This was followed by brown, bay, and gray. Regular grooming sessions are necessary to keep a Fell Pony\u2019s coat looking clean, smooth, and healthy. Extra attention needs to be paid to the tail and the mane, which are thick and long. Adequate washing and grooming will keep these clean and detangled, especially when using the appropriate tail and mane brushes. You should also be sure to clean the hooves carefully with a hoof pick and observe for any conditions that may be developing there. And you need to keep the hair around the hooves clean and healthy, too. For the rest of the body, you can remove debris, loose hair, and dirt from your pony\u2019s coat by using a curry comb, as well as a dandy brush and a shedding blade.

In fact, cave paintings that were created roughly 30,000 years ago exhibit horses that bear striking similarities to the Fjord Horse breed. Experts believe that the first Fjord migrated to Norway, where it was domesticated, more than 4,000 years ago. Also, excavations of Viking burial plots show that this breed has been bred selectively for about 2,000 years. Fjord horses are friendly, gentle, and willing to work. Today, the Fjord Horse still has the same strong survival instincts of its ancestors, and it is a fertile, useful, and healthy horse with a long lifespan. These animals are also excellent foragers, working efficiently to thrive in a variety of conditions, from wet and cold, to dry and hot. Although the origin of the Fjord is not entirely clear, it likely is related to the Przewalski, which was a breed of primitive wild horses that were found in Asia. Also, the Fjord is one of just a few equine breeds that have retained the original primitive color and character. In the past, the Fjord Horse had other names, including the Nordfjordhest and Vestlandshest, giving it a geographical connection to Norway. It is also believed that Vikings utilized Fjord horses as war mounts, so these horses may have affected other breeds that were indigenous to other nations, such as the mountain and moorland pony breeds found in Great Britain, as well as the Icelandic Pony. Farmers in Norway have used the Fjord Horse throughout history to perform various activities, including pulling loads on hills. Also, because of the breed\u2019s appealing personality, strength, smooth and light action, and thick coat that requires minimal care during rough winters, it was exported to several European countries, especially Denmark. There, it became popular in light draft work. The first Fjord studbook was created in 1910, and these animals are still popular today. These horses are often used in riding, driving, endurance classes, cross-country jumping, dressage, and riding school. Fjord horses are friendly, gentle, and willing to work with owners, trainers, and riders of all experience levels. They also display vigor and stamina, and they can be utilized for everything from driving and riding, to draft work and more, thanks to their versatility. You can expect that a Fjord will want to please you and will be easy to train. The mane of a Fjord features dark hair in the center and white outer hair. The Fjord Horse has several features that distinguish it physically from other equine breeds. The head is medium in size and features a flat, broad forehead and a slightly dished or straight profile. Also, the ears are set wide, truncated, and small, while the eyes are round, large, expressive, and dark. The neck on a Fjord Horse is supple and forms a natural arch. Also, the bottom line is shorter than the topline, and the shoulders are muscular, while the withers are long and moderately defined as they extend into the back. This horse\u2019s chest will be wide and the girth will be deep, while the back will be broad, muscular, and anywhere from short to moderately long. Also, a Fjord will feature hooves that are large, round, and dense, and the tail will be set somewhat high. The Fjord Horse is one of the purest and oldest equine breeds. Ninety percent of Fjord horses will showcase a brown dun color, but the remaining 10 percent of them could be yellow dun, gold, pale dun, gray, or red dun. A unique characteristic is that these horses have retained primitive features. These include the \u201cwild\u201d dun color, as well as primitive markings that include zebra stripes on their legs and a dorsal stripe running from the forelock all the way down to the neck, back, and tail. Some Fjord horses will have dark stripes that might be evident over their withers, and red duns will showcase reddish brown stripes, along with body markings. Gray duns will feature very dark gray or black markings and stripes, while the pale or the white dun horse will feature a very light color on the body with gray or black markings and stripes. Also, horses that are yellow dun (which is rare for this breed) will feature darker yellow markings and stripes, and they might even have a white mane, tail, and forelock as well. In addition to grooming your Fjord horse with standard grooming tools that will keep the skin and coat healthy, shiny, beautiful, and clean, extra attention can be paid to the horse\u2019s mane. What makes the mane of the Fjord Horse exceptional is the fact that the center hair will be dark or black but the outer hair will be white. Many owners will cut the mane of this horse short so that the hairs will stand up straight, and the mane will also be trimmed in a crescent shape in order to draw attention to the neck, which curves gracefully. Usually, the white outer hairs are trimmed just a bit shorter than the darker inner hairs in order to further display the beauty and uniqueness of the dark stripe.", "facts": " Small, strong, muscular All levels of horse riders, trainers, and owners who seek a friendly equine companion Playful, quiet, trainable, willing, curious, adaptable, good-natured, calm, dependable, gentle", "tags": "ancient horse, ancient horse breed, fjord, fjord horse, norwegian fjord, norwegian fjord horse, oldest equine breed, primitive features, primitive horse, primitive horse breed, pure equine breed, "}, "florida cracker horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/florida-cracker-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/florida-cracker-horse.jpg", "name": "Florida Cracker Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "The Florida Cracker Horse has a history that dates all the way back to the 1500s. The breed\u2019s ancestry includes Spanish stock that was taken to Florida from Spain. When the Spanish explorers were ready to go back to their home country, they left hogs, horses, and cattle behind in order to create more room for the treasures that they had collected during their journey, so the Florida Cracker Horse was left in America as a result. In terms of genetic heritage, the Florida Cracker Horse was developed from the Iberian Horse of the early 1500s, but the breed also includes Spanish Sorraia, Spanish Jennet, and North African Barb blood. Also, the breed\u2019s genetic base is pretty much the same as that of the Paso Fino, Criolla, Peruvian Paso, and Spanish Mustang, as well as other equine breeds that were developed from horses that were originally introduced to the Caribbean Islands, North America, Central America, South America, and Cuba by the Spanish. The Florida Cracker Horse breed has survived because of ranching families. When the horses were left to roam freely, they evolved over time as a result of natural selection. They were tempered and molded by the challenging environment. And, in addition to playing an important role in the lives of Seminole Indians, they eventually helped Florida become a state of agriculture and ranching. \u201cCrackers\u201d was the name given to Florida cowmen because of the sound that their cow whips made when cracking the air. So this name was also chosen for the agile, small horse that was used amongst their cattle. Over time, the Florida Cracker Horse also became known by other names, including Grass Gut, Florida Cow Pony, Florida Horse, Prairie Pony, Seminole Pony, Chicksaw Pony, and Marsh Tackie. In the 1930s, several relief programs were created during the Great Depression, and one of those programs encouraged moving cattle from the Dust Bowl to Florida. Because of changes in how cattle were handled, ranchers began using the Quarter Horse instead, as that breed was stronger. The Florida Cracker Horse became rare as a result of decreased demand. Over the last 50 years, the Florida Cracker Horse has survived because of ranching families that have continued breeding these horses for their own use. In 1989, the Florida Cracker Horse Association was created, and a registry followed in 1991. Florida Cracker horses are willing to work, and they are also spirited animals, with high levels of endurance and stamina, even in environments that are unfavorable. They can be used for pleasure and trail riding, as well as a variety of work related tasks. These horses are easy to work with because they are strong, intelligent, multi-talented, and patient, and they are suitable for all levels of riders because of their gentle nature. Florida Cracker horses have recognizable ground covering gaits. The Florida Cracker Horse is a small saddle horse. You will note that these animals have a head that is refined, with a slightly concave or straight profile. The jaw should be well defined and short, and the eyes should be alert and reasonably spaced apart. Also, the neck should be fairly narrow and well defined, and it should not have excessive crest. This horse will also feature pronounced withers that are not prominent. The chest should be narrow to medium in width, and the long shoulders should slope with a 40-50 degree angle. The back will be strong, will feature well sprung ribs, and will also be narrow and short. Also, the croup will be short and sloping, the tail will be set medium low, and the under line will be longer than the horse\u2019s top line. Florida Cracker horses are also recognizable by their ground covering gaits, which include the running walk, ambling, trot, and flatfoot walk. The Florida Cracker Horse dates back to the 1500s. The Florida Cracker Horse can feature all of the equine colors. Solid colors and gray, however, are most commonly seen. Other colors include chestnut, dun, bay, roan, grullo, and black. Florida Cracker horses are easy to care for, as they only require basic equine grooming sessions to keep them looking healthy and clean. Regularly grooming your horse will also give him the attention and companionship he craves while strengthening your bond with your animal. When your horse gets very dirty, you can use a gentle equine shampoo and conditioner to thoroughly clean him. Otherwise, you can use standard grooming tools, including a curry comb, body finishing brush, dandy brush, and shedding blade, along with a mane comb and a tail brush. When used together in the same grooming session, these tools will effectively remove excess hair, as well as dirt, mud, and other debris that can accumulate on the horse\u2019s coat while he is working and being ridden outside.

In the early part of the 19th century, trotting races started to grow in popularity, so a lot of the horses that were bred throughout France during that time were bred for the specific purpose of racing them. This particular equine breed is the result of crossing the muscular Norman stock horse with the English Thoroughbred and the Norfolk Trotter. Initially, the French Trotter was a coarse and heavy breed in appearance, much like its Normandy ancestors. But, over time, the Thoroughbred genes allowed this breed to attain a more refined form. Standardbred horses were also used in developing the French Trotter Horse, and those genes helped these horses develop their trotting gait, their level and balanced stride, and their speed. However, even though this equine breed has American Standardbred genes in its bloodline, it features a two-beat diagonal gait instead of the pacing gait or lateral two-beat gait. The French Trotter Horse is calm, gentle, submissive, and easy to train. The French Trotter Horse was officially recognized as its own breed in 1922, and in 1937, the breed\u2019s stud book was closed to other horses that were not of a French breed. This was done to protect the French Trotter\u2019s unique qualities. Today, the French Trotter has become one of the most popular equine breeds in France, and it is still beloved as a powerful race horse. The French Trotter breed has a wonderful personality that makes these horses a pleasure to work with. These animals are calm, gentle, and submissive, making them easy to train. Their good behavior combined with their energy make them enthusiastic horses that are athletic and willing to please. Because of this horse breed\u2019s strength and its solid contour, it has been used often in horse riding schools. The French Trotter exhibits discipline and determination, along with endurance, intelligence, and an exceptional gait, making it a great horse to ride, regardless of your experience level. French Trotters can trot almost as quickly as a Thoroughbred can gallop. French Trotter horses are more than just beautiful animals, they are also revered for their high speeds, their incredible strength, and their high endurance and stamina. This is why they are popular for racing under saddle, as well as in harness racing. They are even used in skijoring, which is a type of horse race that occurs on snow and has the driver riding on skies behind his horse. The French Trotter features a head that is slightly large and straight, and it showcases wide-set eyes. The ears are alert and the nostrils should be wide. There will be a well set, extended neck of a proportional length, and there will be powerful, sloping shoulders. The horse\u2019s chest will be deep and broad and also feature a prominent breastbone. The back will be strong as well, and the croup will be wide and long. When looking at a French Trotter, you will notice that these horses also feature muscular, powerful hindquarters that allow them to attain high speeds, despite being quite short.

The breed has several accepted coat colors that include gray, black, chestnut, brown, and bay. However, it is rare that you will find a gray French Trotter. The French Trotter Horse should be cleaned and groomed on a regular basis. You can use a gentle equine shampoo and conditioner whenever necessary, particularly if the horse becomes quite dirty as a result of being in the great outdoors. Otherwise, a standard grooming session should be sufficient to massage the skin and coat and increase circulation for healthy skin. To keep your French Trotter\u2019s lovely coat looking clean, smooth, silky, and healthy, you can use a standard equine grooming kit. This will include a shedding blade, curry comb, dandy brush, and body finishing brush, as well as a mane comb and a tail brush. All of these brushes can be used throughout the body to completely remove any loose hair, debris, mud, dirt, etc. that has accumulated in the coat. When dealing with sensitive areas, however, such as the horse\u2019s eyes and ears, you can use a damp cloth and a gentle touch to get those clean. Always make it a point to check your horse\u2019s hooves during each grooming session.

The breed is also believed to have descended from the Forest Horse, which was a primitive breed. According to evidence, the Friesian Horse might have been in existence since 1000 B.C. Later, the Roman historian known as Tacitus noted the existence of the Friesian, and described the horse as versatile and powerful. Both German and Friesian knights who fought in the Crusades used the Friesian Horse, so these animals came into contact with Eastern horses, and the breed was lightened as a result. These horses were also improved, particularly in terms of range of movement and stamina, thanks to Barb and Andalucian influences that took place when Spain took control of the Netherlands throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. And these horses even played a major role in influencing many other equine breeds, including the Fell and Dales ponies, the Oldenburg Horse, and the Shire Horse. The Friesian Horse, which is one of Europe\u2019s oldest horse breeds, was created in Friesland. During the 17th century, Friesian horses were also imported to North America. However, due to crossbreeding, the purebred Friesian was lost in that part of the world until it was reintroduced in 1974. Like other horse breeds, the Friesian came close to extinction, particularly in the early part of the 20th century, because of the rising popularity of trotting horses combined with the reduced number of horses that were used in agriculture. In fact, in 1913, only three Friesian stallions were living in Friesland. Thankfully, these unique horses were saved. It took World War II and a fuel shortage to encourage Dutch farmers to start using horses again, so a new breeding program began with the help of imported Oldenburg stallions. Friesian horses are smart and gentle, though they are best suited to individuals who have some level of experience working with horses. They are also versatile and willing to be trained, so they are easy to work with. Trainers note how well these horses learn new things, as well as how well they are able to retain knowledge. This breed is known for being proud, strong, loyal, cheerful, and calm. And because these animals are people oriented and willing to please, they form strong bonds with their riders. Friesian horses are smart and gentle, though they are best suited to individuals who have some level of experience working with horses. The Friesian horse breed is renowned for its gorgeous black coat and thick, long mane and tail. These horses typically do not have any markings, but they can still be registered as purebred even if they showcase a small star on the forehead. Another beautiful feature of the Friesian is the feathering on the lower legs. This feathering is left untrimmed on purpose by horse breeders and owners. These horses feature a body that is muscular and compact. They have a fine head with an arched and thick neck. And you can find two conformation types in this breed, which are the modern sport type and the classic heavy type. The Friesian horse breed is renowned for its gorgeous black coat and thick, long mane and tail. The most common color of the Friesian breed is black, though these horses can also range from black-bay or deep dark brown, to true black. There should not be any white markings at all, although a small star is allowed. In order to keep a Friesian horse looking its best, you will need to do more than your routine equine grooming routine. In fact, these horses need a lot more grooming than average, as they have a thick tail and mane, as well as the feathers on the lower legs. To keep the tail healthy, cut it at the lowest point, making sure to cut evenly. You should cut at the height of the horse\u2019s fetlock in order to prevent the tail from dragging on the ground, and this should leave enough hair in order to produce a tail that remains thick all the way to the bottom. To maintain the horse\u2019s mane, which is typically left long, don\u2019t cut the hair along the bottom, as that will cause it to become uneven. Instead, pull the mane, which involves pulling out the longest hairs, until you are able to reach the length that is desired. You will have to do this quite often in order to maintain it at the right length. Finally, to maintain the feathers on the horse\u2019s lower legs and keep them looking neat, you will need to clip the hairs behind the knees, as well as on the front of the horse\u2019s cannon bone. Also, trim any feathers that end up dragging along the ground, but allow the hair to remain around and below the fetlock.", "facts": " Muscular, powerful Equine trainers, riders, and owners who have some experience working with horses Trainable, intelligent, gentle, loyal, calm", "tags": "calm horse, Friesian Horse, Friesland, gentle horse, Netherlands, the Crusades, "}, "gypsy horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/gypsy-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gypsy-horse.jpg", "name": "Gypsy Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "The Gypsy Horse is registered as the Gypsy Vanner Horse, as well as the Gypsy Cob Horse and Gypsy Drum Horse. The breed originated in Great Britain, where it has been popular amongst the Romany Gypsies. It is a horse that can easily pull gypsy caravans, and this colorful equine breed can still be seen today as horses move alongside their owners while traveling to annual gathering locations. Over the past 50 years, a greater number of horses have been bred selectively so that they will exhibit the characteristics of the ideal caravan horse. Also, when it comes to genetic makeup, the Gypsy Horse breed likely is the result of a combination of Clydesdale, Friesian, British ponies like the Dales Pony, and the Shire Horse. Gypsy horses are docile, gentle, quiet, and patient. Although originally from Great Britain, today the Gypsy Horse is also being imported, as well as bred, throughout Canada and the United States. In North America, the horses have become desirable show horses, carriage horses, and trail horses, but in the United Kingdom, they are well known for being reliable driving horses. Because Gypsy Horses are bred to pull caravans, as well as carry gypsy children on their backs, they are docile, gentle, quiet, and patient. These characteristics make this equine breed an ideal choice for horse riders and owners of all experience levels. Even beginners will feel comfortable around this breed, and children will be able to ride Gypsy horses confidently as well. The athletic Gypsy Horse will also learn quickly, making it an ideal choice for those seeking an equine companion that will be easy to work with. These animals are willing to be trained and are ready to please, as well as highly intelligent, so they are a pleasure to be around. The Gypsy Horse comes in a variety of colors, and some can even have uniquely beautiful blue eyes. The Gypsy Horse has several distinguishing characteristics, including legs that are abundantly feathered and a thick tail and mane. The feathering will begin around the knees on the front legs, as well as around the hocks on the rear legs, and it will extend over the front of the horse\u2019s hooves. These horses are small yet strong draft type animals that feature hindquarters that are heavily muscled. They also have large hooves, along with a short back that is proportionate to the rest of the body. The chest is broad, the hips are well rounded and heavy, and the neck is strong. Also, although the average height for this horse ranges from 14 to 15.2 hands, you can find the Gypsy Horse in all heights. For example, you can find horses that are under 14 hands (those are referred to as Mini Vanners), as well as horses that are over 15.2 hands (those are known as Grand Vanners). The athletic Gypsy Horse will learn quickly and is eager to please. The Gypsy Horse comes in a variety of colors, and some can even have uniquely beautiful blue eyes. Common colors include black, white, buckskin, bay, and chestnut, but these horses can also be gray and flaxen chestnut. Dilutions that are commonly seen within the Gypsy Horse breed include silver dapple, perlino, palomino, cremello, and smoky black. Skewbalds and piebalds are also popular colors for this breed. The Gypsy Horse can also display various color patterns, such as tobiano, sabino/blagdon, splash, spotted, bay roan, strawberry roan, blue roan, badger face, and Gulastra Plume. The Gypsy Horse\u2019s hair should ideally be silky and straight. In order to maintain its beautiful appearance, as well as the health of this horse\u2019s skin and coat, regular grooming sessions that include brushing and bathing are necessary. Because dirt and mud tend to cause the Gypsy Horse\u2019s hair to become dry, it is a good idea to begin every grooming session by using a rubber curry comb. This will bring dander and dirt to the coat\u2019s surface so it will be easier to remove when you go over it with a body brush. This step also stimulates circulation and encourages the production of natural oils that allow the skin to be healthy, shiny, and lovely. To comb this horse\u2019s abundant tail and mane, begin at the ends and then work your way up slowly and thoroughly. When you encounter hairs that have become tangled, use a detangler and gently remove the knot with your fingers before running a comb through again. Be sure to use grooming tools that are specifically designed for use on the tail and mane. Bear in mind, too, that feathered equine breeds like the Gypsy Horse are prone to dermatitis and scratches underneath the feathering on the legs.

It originated during the early part of the 1700s in England, and it was produced by crossing Thoroughbred horses with Arabian horses. Horses were then crossed with the Norfolk Trotter, which was another equine breed that was commonly found in England. The result was the Hackney, which is a light, refined horse that has a dynamic trot, along with plenty of spirit and style. Once the Hackney Horse was crossed with the Welsh Pony, the Hackney Pony was created, and these smaller horses retained a lot of the characteristics of the Hackney as well. Hackney horses enjoy being around handlers and being petted. By the late 1800s, Hackney horses were being imported to the US from England. It was during that time that the goal was to breed a particular pony type by crossing the Hackney Horse with ponies that had good motion and conformation. As a result, 95% of all of the registered Hackneys that are in the United States today are ponies. The English Hackney Horse Society was set up in 1883 in order to develop the integrity of the breed, as well as preserve Hackney Horse lines. The society held its first annual show in London in 1885, and the American Hackney Horse Society was created in 1891. The production of the automobile eventually eliminated any demand for carriage horses that were needed for transportation, so the Hackney Horse is mostly used in the show ring today. The Hackney Horse is a highly intelligent breed that can be nervous and high-strung, so these animals need to be handled and trained carefully by those who are experienced in working with equine companions. These horses can be mild and gentle, as well as loyal and eager to please, but they are known for being tenacious as well. They can be trained to perform a variety of tasks, and they do enjoy being around handlers and being petted. When in motion, the Hackney Horse seems as though it\u2019s floating over the ground. Both the Hackney Pony and the Hackney Horse are known for their high action in both the back and front legs. They feature a proud appearance and snappy motion. Their eyes and ears are alert, and they also showcase disciplined carriage of the tail and head. While the Hackney Pony is small, coming in under 14.2 hands (58\u201d), it does have a trim, fine head that features small ears, as well as trim feet and legs and a balanced body. The back is short and the tail and the head are well arched. The Hackney Horse, on the other hand, is proportionately heavier, and its height can average anywhere from 14 to 16 hands. Also, this horse is heavily muscled and sturdy, and it features a wide, broad chest, arched neck, and deep body. The head is small and features a clean-cut throat and jaw, well-shaped ears, and a delicate muzzle. The neck is crested and muscular, the shoulder is powerful and long and gently slopes down to the horse\u2019s back, and the tail is moderately dense and dark. When in motion, the Hackney Horse seems as though it is floating over the ground. It is known for its style and showiness, and it has a distinctively high knee and hock action that is the result of good flexion in the joints. These animals have a recognizable moment of suspension, and they will reach out the front legs from the shoulders on every stride. The hind legs are also flexible, allowing for the legs to rise, bend the hock, and reach forward during every stride as well. The Hackney is a breed that has two branches: the pony and the horse. Dark colors are most commonly seen in the Hackney breed. You will often find horses that feature brown, black, chestnut, and bay colors, and some horses can even be spotted. The Hackney Horse enjoys being groomed and getting plenty of attention, so regularly grooming your equine companion is the best way to develop a strong and lasting bond. A standard grooming practice is all that you need to keep the Hackney Horse looking beautiful and healthy. Therefore, you can start with a hoof pick to remove debris and dirt that has become lodged in the animal\u2019s hooves. A curry comb can be utilized to dislodge any debris and dirt that has become tangled within the hair or that has gotten stuck to the horse\u2019s skin. You can also use a body brush or a soft brush to get rid of excess debris that has been loosened up with the curry comb, and a mane comb and a tail comb can be used to untangle delicate hair.

In fact, this breed does not even have its own breeding stud because it is usually just combined with that of the Hackney Horse. This pony breed dates back to 1872, when Christopher Wilson developed it in order to create a new pony within the already popular Hackney Horse breed. To get the results that he wanted, the Hackney Horse was bred with the Fell Pony and the Welsh Pony. The result was a pony with similar characteristics to the Hackney Horse, such as agility and speed, but in a smaller package that would be ideal for carriage pulling, shows, and children. In addition to being beautiful, the Hackney Pony also has an appealing personality. At first, the Hackney Pony was referred to as the Wilson Pony. And because these ponies were kept outside even in tough conditions, the breed developed its endurance and ability to adapt to various conditions. By the time the 1880s rolled around, the Hackney Pony breed was finally established and known for its trotting ability. These little horses were used as carriage horses in Great Britain, and some were exported to the U.S. as well, where they were also used throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries before cars were commonplace. Although these ponies, like other equine breeds, declined in popularity and use with the rise of the automobile in the 20th century, the breed became more popular as a show pony following World War II. And these ponies were even used in the United States to develop the American Shetland Pony. Today, the Hackney Pony is still a popular equine breed. As a show breed, Hackney Ponies could be categorized based upon their appearance, size, and show ring performance. These categories include the Roadster Pony, the Harness Pony, the Hand Pony, the Cobtail Pony, and the Pleasure Pony. In addition to being beautiful, the Hackney Pony also has an appealing personality. These horses are calm, friendly, and smart. However, they could also be energetic and spirited, so care should be taken when they are around children until you get to know their personality. On top of that, Hackney Ponies also like receiving plenty of attention from their caretakers, so they even look forward to being groomed regularly. Plus, this breed is known for being brave and alert. They have great stamina and enjoy being active, so they make great show ponies and fun pets. Therefore, a Hackney Pony may not be the best choice for those who don\u2019t plan on giving their horse attention and allowing their pet to release his energy in productive ways. The Hackney Pony is related to the Hackney Horse. The adorable and elegant Hackney Pony features small ears and a small yet fine muzzle. You will also notice large, bright eyes that are alert and bold. The head is small and convex, while the neck is well formed and long. The body is compact and slim, and the frame is light. The legs are strong, the feet are hard, and you may notice that these ponies hold their heads high as well. There is great depth in the chest, the shoulders are powerful, the tail is well set on the pony\u2019s quarters and it is carried high, and the withers are low. This pony moves with a gait that is referred to as the park trot. This means that the animal\u2019s knees will rise up high. So another defining characteristic of this breed is how it moves. Hackney Ponies have great stamina and enjoy being active. The fine and silky coat of the Hackney Pony could be black, chestnut, or bay in color. The majority of these ponies, though, will feature a bay colored coat, while chestnut colored Hackney Ponies are considered rare. And some Hackney Ponies could also feature a few white markings on the body, head, and legs. To keep your Hackney Pony looking healthy, you do not need to do anything special. Instead, the same basic grooming routine that you can use when caring for any other horse can also be employed for this pony. To get started, all you need is a standard grooming kit for horses. Then it is a matter of setting a routine of grooming your horse to help keep him clean and happy. Your pony should really enjoy the attention and look forward to the grooming sessions, as this breed likes to be pampered. You could bathe your Hackney Pony with a gentle shampoo designed for horses whenever it is necessary to do so. The rest of the time, you could use a curry comb to remove loose hair and debris from your pony\u2019s coat. Using circular motions with this tool will help you get good results. You could then follow that up with a body finishing brush to cover sensitive areas like the legs before using a shedding blade and dandy brush to remove even more excess hair and debris. Next, to clean your pony\u2019s face, you could just use a soft cloth that has been moistened with some water. Gently clean the areas around the ears and eyes. Finally, you can use a hoof pick to clean out the hooves, a tail brush to comb out the tail to keep it smooth, and a mane comb to remove tangles and keep the mane looking lustrous.

King George II of England, who was also the Elector of Hanover, was the first person to breed the Hanoverian Horse. He was responsible for founding the Stallion Depot at Celle in Germany, using 14 Holsteiner stallions that he selected and bred with Thoroughbred horses in order to lighten the build while increasing stamina. The offspring were meant to be utilized as cavalry horses, as well as carriage horses and animals that would work in the fields. Later, more Thoroughbred blood continued to be introduced into the bloodline, thereby making this equine breed increasingly light, agile, athletic, and graceful.

It originated in Schleswig-Holstein, a region in northern Germany, when a monastery at Uetersen started breeding horses to create a breed that could be used for both work and riding. Following the Reformation, the government of Germany and private breeders took charge of maintaining the Holsteiner Horse breed, and the breed was changed over time in order to meet various new needs. The horses were used in war, in shows, and as carriage horses, as a few examples. And during the 19th century, Cleveland Bays and Yorkshire Coach horses were also added to the breeding program in order to create an even more animated yet elegant carriage horse. The Holsteiner is popular in international competitions. As time went on, the Holsteiner breed was changed again and again in order to keep the horse in demand. For example, following World War II, the demand for a multi-purpose and athletic sport horse was high, so Selle Francais, Anglo-Arab, and Thoroughbred blood was added to the line as well. All of these changes led to this horse becoming strong, versatile, and popular, even in Olympic equestrian sports. In 1978, the American Holsteiner Horse Association was created. It, along with the Holsteiner Verband of Germany, oversees every aspect of the breeding, registration, and grading of these horses. Today, the Holsteiner studbook is one of the smallest in Europe, but the breed is still popular in international competitions. And these horses are one of the best sport horses on the planet, so you will find them competing in dressage, jumping, and more. Holsteiner Horses are known for being easygoing animals, and they are typically quiet. Despite sometimes being a bit lazy, these horses want to perform at their best. They have a generally good temperament, a willingness to work, and great rideability. Plus, these horses are known for their loving personality, as well as their intelligence. Many people who care for these animals find that they become your friend and a wonderful companion in no time. Keep in mind that every horse is an individual, so one Holsteiner might be lazier or more sensitive than another. If you do not have a lot of experience with horses, you may encounter a cooperative and steady Holsteiner that will be a good horse to start with. And if you are a professional rider, there are also Holsteiners that will be bold and ready for adventurous riding. Generally, though, the majority of Holsteiners are considered confident, reliable, strong-nerved, and well-balanced animals. The Holsteiner Horse has been around for more than 700 years. A Holsteiner Horse could be described as large and muscular, yet elegant. They feature a flexible and short topline, along with an arching neck that appears rather graceful.

However, the various bay shades, along with chestnut, are considered the most commonly seen coat colors for these horses. Traditionally, the Holsteiner Horse had minimal markings and featured dark colors. Therefore, there is a preference for horses that are brown, dark bay, or black. However, lighter colors, such as gray and chestnut, are permitted in this breed as well. The horses that are excluded from the Holsteiner registry are those that feature any traits that are associated with leopard spotting, as well as those hoses that have large white spots associated with pinto patterning. Also, buckskin and palomino aren\u2019t acceptable colors for this breed either. Like other equine breeds, the Holsteiner will benefit from a regular grooming routine, and every session is a wonderful opportunity to bond with your horse.

Follow that with a dandy brush, using flicking motions to brush in a manner that will get more dirt off of the coat. Then, you could use a body brush to smooth the hair down and remove any remaining traces of dirt. This brush will also help give the coat a clean and shiny look. When you are done with the body, you can use a mane and tail brush or comb to detangle and clean the mane and the tail.

However, experts believe that these horses were brought to Iceland more than 11 centuries ago by the Vikings prior to any European equine breeds, and it is linked with the first domesticated horses. Norse horses that Vikings took to Iceland were sturdy and compact, as well as a bit larger than the Icelandic horses people know of today. Once in Iceland, these horses were isolated and had to evolve in order to survive in an environment with a harsh climate and sparse food. This breed also assisted Norse people in prospering and succeeding by helping them travel over long distances, plow fields, and carry loads. As a result, the Vikings placed a lot of value on these animals and took them on explorations. Icelandic horses are adaptable, patient, and uncomplicated. The first Icelandic equine breed societies were created in 1904, and the first register was formed in 1923. The Icelandic Horse was used in Iceland in the early part of the 1900s for travel and transportation, and it was also a reliable working horse. Later, in the 1940s and 1950s, the horse\u2019s role diminished.

This breed\u2019s bones are dense, and these animals are agile, sure-footed, and sturdy. Also, the eyes are large, and the heavy head is well defined. Icelandic horses will not be fully grown until they reach 6 or 7 years of age, so they take a long time to mature. Therefore, they are typically only used for riding once they are 4 or 5 years old. This breed can also perform a few different gaits that include walk, trot, canter, flying pace, and tolt. The Icelandic Horse is one of the world\u2019s oldest breeds.

Standard equine grooming tools, as well as equine shampoo, can be used to thoroughly remove any dirt, mud, and debris that the coat may collect while the horse is out in the elements. For example, you can use a curry comb, a shedding blade, a mane comb and a tail comb, a body finishing brush, and a dandy brush to smooth and clean the coat. Also be sure to check your horse\u2019s hooves for injuries and infections, and use a hoof pick to clean any debris from within the hooves as well. If you notice that your horse begins to sweat too much in the winter or even in the autumn, it might be best to clip the coat. Clipped horses do not sweat as much, and their coat will also dry much more quickly. It is best to use a bib clip, which involves clipping the hair underneath the neck, as well as on the chest. This will help the horse stay cooler while it is working, but there will still be enough hair left in order to ensure that the horse will stay warm in cold temperatures.", "facts": " Stocky, compact Horse owners, riders, and trainers of all levels, including beginners and children Lively, spirited, independent, adaptable, patient, friendly, enjoys the company of people", "tags": "ancient horse breed, icelandic horse, icelandic horse breed, icelandic pony, pony breed, viking horse, Vikings, "}, "irish draught horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/irish-draught-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/irish-draught-horse.jpg", "name": "Irish Draught Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "As its name implies, the Irish Draught Horse comes from Ireland, and the first mentions of this breed date back to the 18th century.

Standard horse grooming tools will be sufficient to keep your horse\u2019s coat smooth, shiny, and free of dirt, mud, and other debris. Use a hoof pick to clean out the horse\u2019s hooves after riding, and utilize a curry comb to remove any loose hair and debris that has collected in the coat. Other tools, including a dandy brush, body finishing brush, and shedding blade, can further remove debris and excess hair. To keep your horse\u2019s mane, which is one of its most beautiful features, flowing smoothly and free of tangles, simply use a mane comb. A tail brush can also be used on the tail to keep it untangled and clean.

During that time, there was also a need for horses that would be fast and light for use in riding schools and in the military. The Lipizzaner Horse is considered a horse of royalty, and because it took 400 years of selective breeding to develop this unique animal, it is also one of Europe\u2019s oldest equine breeds. The Lipizzan Horse is known for being highly intelligent and trainable. The Spanish Horse that was the result of crossing Arab and Berber stallions with Iberian mares was known for its beauty, intelligence, and sturdiness, so Maximillan II brought this horse to Austria in 1562. It was at Kladrub that he was able to found the court stud. Archduke Charles, Maximillan\u2019s brother, also established a stud farm using Spanish stock at Lippiza in 1580. The Lipizza and Kladrub stock were bred with native Karst horses. Succeeding generations were also bred with the Neapolitan, as well as other Baroque horses that were of Spanish descent and were obtained from Denmark, Germany, and Spain. Kladrub focused on creating heavier carriage horses, but light carriage horses and riding horses were from the Lipizza stud. Lipizzan horses are known for being highly intelligent and trainable. Therefore, in addition to being beautiful and regal in appearance, these horses make wonderful equine companions to riders and owners who have some experience working with horses. However, it should also be noted that Lipizzan horses can sometimes exhibit stubborn behavior, so they do require a bit of patience, as well as knowledge of how to handle a horse that is being a little difficult. By rewarding good behavior with treats, a trainer can instill good habits in this horse. The Lipizzaner Horse is considered a horse of royalty. The Lipizzan Horse is renowned for its proud carriage and its sturdy, compact body. The head, which is usually slightly dished, is similar to that of the Arabian, but these horses may also feature the convex profile of the Spanish Horse. Also, the horse\u2019s head is set high on a neck that is arched and muscular, and these horses are known for their large, dark, expressive, and beautiful eyes, as well as their alert, small ears. When you look at the body of this breed, it is truly an image of strength, even though it is not incredibly tall. You will easily note the powerful shoulders, hindquarters that are clearly muscular, and the crested neck. The legs are also strong with well-defined joints and tendons. The back is short, as are the cannon bones, but the girth is deep. Because of their powerful hindquarters, these horses can perform challenging haute ecole dressage movements that include \u201cairs above the ground.\u201d Overall, the Lipizzan Horse\u2019s gaits are considered elastic and powerful, and these animals are known for being naturally balanced. The white coat of the Lipizzaner will come in anywhere from 6 to 10 years of age. Genetically, the Lipizzan is a type of gray, not white, horse. Even though this equine breed features a white coat, these animals are born a dark color, such as brown, mouse gray, or black-brown. The coat will eventually lighten until the horse has a gorgeous white coat as an adult. The white coat of the Lipizzaner will come in anywhere from 6 to 10 years of age, and it is the dominant color of this breed, although you may occasionally find a Lipizzan Horse that is brown or black. Historically, adult herds have also had horses of other colors, such as dun, chestnut, skewbald, and piebald. You will need to groom a Lipizzan Horse constantly in order to maintain the beauty of its unique white coat, as it will quickly begin to look dirty and unattractive if you do not regularly bathe and brush the animal. Shampoo the Lipizzan Horse on a regular basis using an equine shampoo. This will remove the majority of staining that can occur on the coat. You can even search for products that are specifically designed for use on white horses. Also, if the mane or tail is stained badly, you can lather the shampoo into the hair and let it stand for a few minutes to allow the cleanser to work before rinsing and repeating. In addition to shampooing the horse, you should also use standard equine grooming tools to remove dirt, dust, and other debris from the Lipizzan\u2019s coat, from the mane all the way to the tail. These include a curry comb, which you can use all over the animal\u2019s body, a mane comb, and a tail brush. A body finishing brush is ideal for sensitive areas like the face and legs, and a dandy brush can work on loosening mud, dirt, and hair quite easily as well.

The Sorraia dates back to 20,000 B.C., making it a primitive breed, and it is even found on cave paintings. When the Celt and Phoenician traders brought horses to the Iberian Peninsula from northern Africa around 900 B.C., those horses bred with the Sorraia. Despite their common ancestry, the Lusitano and the Andalusian are quite different. In the 17th century, the Spanish no longer used horses in bullfighting, so they began breeding the Andalusian Horse for pleasure riding instead. Lusitano horses are filled with a lot of energy, so they need to be exercised regularly. On the other hand, the Portuguese continued to use the Lusitano Horse in bullfighting, so they wanted to maintain the characteristics of the breed that were already popular at the time. These features included agility, calmness, and bravery, particularly when it came to moving towards a threat. In addition to bullfighting, the Lusitano Horse was also utilized as a workhorse for pulling carriages, as well as for farm work, but it was even used as a cavalry mount. The Lusitano Horse and the Andalusian Horse shared the same registry until the 1960s, when breeders of the Lusitano wished to emphasize the unique features of this breed. Portuguese breeders created a studbook in order to set Spanish Andalusians apart from their Andalusians. Therefore, in 1966, the official Lusitano registry was formed, and the breed\u2019s official name became Puro Sangue Lusitano. Lusitano horses are known for their endearing personality. These animals are enthusiastic, kind, generous, and noble. They are also gentle, friendly creatures that work well with any level of rider and trainer because they are able to concentrate and focus on the task at hand. Plus, these horses are revered particularly for their courage, as well as their cool head even when faced with a difficult situation, so they are able to remain calm and easy to manage. These animals are filled with a lot of energy, so they need to be exercised regularly. They are also fast learners, and they are loyal. Therefore, owners who have plenty of time to spend with their horses are ideal for the Lusitano. Those who are able to provide their horses with the activity and enrichment that they require will do best with this breed. The Lusitano requires extra attention and care to maintain the beauty of its thick tail and mane. The Lusitano breed has a noble appearance. It features a head that is medium in length, well proportioned, and narrow. These horses also have a lower jaw that is somewhat unpronounced, although the cheek will be long. The forehead features a rounded profile, and the medium-length ears are expressive, narrow, and fine. The eyes are almond shaped, large, confident, and expressive. And the neck is also medium in length, but it is arched and features a hairline that is narrow. This horse\u2019s withers will be long and well defined, as well as higher than the croup. Also, there will be a smooth transition from the animal\u2019s back to the neck. The chest is muscular, deep, and medium in size as well, while the shoulders are muscular, slanting, and long. Even the ribcage is well developed, deep, and long, with the ribs arching diagonally into the horse\u2019s spine, creating a full and short flank. Finally, when looking at this horse, you will also notice that its legs are long and slender, the whole body is compact with a short back, and the tail and the mane are full and wavy. When comparing the Lusitano to the Andalusian, it is clear that the head is more convex, the croup is more sloping, and the tail is set lower. Lusitano horses are known for their endearing personality. The Lusitano Horse can be found in any solid color; however, bay and gray are the most common colors. Other possible colors include chestnut, black, dun, and palomino. In addition to the standard grooming procedures that you would follow with any equine companion, the Lusitano Horse requires a bit of extra attention and care in order to maintain the beauty of this breed\u2019s thick tail and mane.

This was a period of time when unusual and odd animals became talking points, particularly amongst the nobility. Miniature horses that were not as refined were referred to as \u201cpit ponies,\u201d and they were put to work inside mines, where they also lived. And, with the arrival of the 1930s came the arrival of Miniature horses in America, where they also worked in coal mines. The foundation breed of the Miniature Horse is the Shetland Pony, however other equine breeds were later included as the years passed. These included the Hackney pony, which was added in order to further refine the Miniature breed and its movement, as well as other horse breeds featuring pinto marking in order to alter the Miniature\u2019s colors. Miniature Horses were also called \u201cpit ponies,\u201d and they were put to work inside mines. Ultimately, it was the selective breeding that created today\u2019s Miniature Horse. These horses are smaller versions of their full size counterparts. Draft Horses, Arabians, Paints, and Quarter Horses, for example, can all be found in a miniature form. In 1978, the American Miniature Horse Association was created to keep track of the majority of Miniature horses in the world. The Miniature horse is known for being gentle and friendly towards people. They enjoy spending time around humans, and they crave interaction and company, even from strangers. These horses are also much easier to handle compared to full sized horses, and they make wonderful pets, particularly for children, because they are so calm and small. These animals thrive on human affection and attention, and they will also show high levels of intelligence and curiosity, making them fun to care for. Overall, these horses are ideal for individuals who have thought about owning a horse but have had concerns about being able to care for and handle a full sized horse that could weigh more than 1,000 pounds. Miniature horses only need roughly an acre of land to roam and exercise. Also, caring for and feeding these animals is the same as for all other equine breeds, just on a smaller scale. The Miniature horse is known for being gentle and friendly towards people. It is important to note that the Miniature Horse breed is not the same as a pony. This is because a pony is simply a horse that stands shorter than 58 inches. Also, a pony will have a strong, wide body, and it will look quite different from other riding horses. The neck on a pony is typically muscular, while the legs are short for the size of the rest of the body. The Miniature Horse, on the other hand, is shorter than even the smallest pony breeds because it must not be taller than 34 inches at the top of the shoulders. These horses also only weigh anywhere from 150 to 250 pounds when they are fully grown. So even though some Miniature horses might resemble some ponies, the ultimate goal of a Miniature Horse breeder is to create a truly tiny horse that has everything that its full-sized counterpart would have. In other words, it\u2019s as though you\u2019re shrinking a fully sized horse down into a miniature form. Therefore, these horses should not have a thick neck, a big belly, or short legs. Today, the Miniature Horse is bred mainly as either a stock horse type or a refined type. The stock horse type has a broad chest and muscular legs. The refined type has a dished face that dips in below its forehead, along with a delicate muzzle, large eyes, a slimmer body, and finer bones. The Miniature Horse is  much easier to handle compared to full sized horses, and they make wonderful pets. The Miniature Horse comes in every equine color and pattern, including pinto, palomino, and pintaloosa, which is a cross between an Appaloosa and a pinto. When it comes to grooming a Miniature horse, it is important to purchase the right tools and to establish the right routine so that your pet will enjoy the experience and be totally comfortable. A good routine to follow involves starting off with a soft bristle brush on your horse\u2019s face. This is because a regular brush will be too hard for a Miniature\u2019s sensitive face. And if you note that the face or the eyes require a bit more cleaning than just brushing, you can simply moisten a washcloth and then gently rub that into any areas that need extra attention. Next, you can brush the forelock, tail, and mane gently by using a pin cushion style brush. It is best to begin at the bottom of the horse\u2019s tail and then work your way to the dock. In this way, you will break the fewest number of hairs. Then make circular motions using a soft curry comb in one hand, and follow that with a regular bristle body brush in the other hand to remove excess hair, debris, and dust. Be especially gentle on the girth area and underbelly, as these are sensitive spots on your Miniature horse.

These tasks included hauling logs and plowing fields, as a couple of examples. But the horses would also need to be appropriate for the working families who needed them for general riding as well. That\u2019s how the Missouri Fox Trotter came into being. As more people migrated to the western parts of the United States from places like Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, they brought a variety of horses, including the Morgan and Arabian equine breeds, as well as the Tennessee Walking Horse, the Standardbred, and the American Saddlebred. The result of these horses being bred with one another was the Missouri Fox Trotting Horse, which was developed during the 1800s. The Missouri Fox Trotter is known for its calm and gentle nature. The Missouri Fox Trotter quickly became popular because it was versatile and had the stamina to travel over long distances. This unique horse also had a comfortable gait and a fearless attitude when it came to living and working on the difficult mountain terrain. In the latter part of the 1940s, horse breeders created and established a group whose aim was maintaining a studbook for this new equine breed. This organization would later become known as the Missouri Fox Trotting Horse Breeder\u2019s Association in 1958. Today, the Missouri Fox Trotter is easily found throughout many parts of the United States, as well as Canada and some parts of Germany and Austria. The Missouri Fox Trotter is an equine breed that is able to work with horse owners and riders of all levels because it is known for its calm and gentle nature.

This horse\u2019s legs are sturdy, tapered, and muscular, with properly shaped and well-proportioned hooves. Also, the flank of this horse breed is sleek, while the chest is full and deep, and the ribs are well sprung.

According to experts, nomadic Mongolians have been documenting these horses since roughly 2000 BC. As a result of its long history, this breed has been able to influence the development of other equine breeds throughout both Asia and Europe. For example, several breeds from Japan, such as the Noma Horse, the Hokkaido, the Kiso, the Myako, the Taishu, the Misaki, and the Tokara, may have been influenced by the Mongolian horse. And Mongolian horses are also linked to Scandinavian breeds, as well as horses from Iceland, the British Isles, and Central Europe, with the Icelandic Horse being quite similar to the Mongolian, as an example. The Mongolian horse dates back to ancient times. During the 13th century, Mongolian horses were used by Genghis Khan, as they were hardy, energetic, and self-sufficient. They made effective warhorses except for the fact that they were slower than other horses on the battlefield at times. And beyond serving as warhorses, these animals were also used for meat and milk by soldiers. Despite its popularity, the Mongolian horse hasn\u2019t yet been recognized officially by any of the equine breed organizations. Instead, these horses are maintained mainly by the indigenous and nomadic people in Mongolia. And those horses living in Mongolia today will spend time in the great outdoors throughout the year, so they are used to surviving in temperatures ranging from -40\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F. They are left to search for food on their own, and they are used for milk and meat, as well as for riding, transport, work, and racing. The Mongolian horse is known for having an affectionate and affable personality, particularly after he has become used to his rider. These horses tend to be quite friendly, reliable, loyal, and calm. And because they are versatile and talented, these horses could be used in a variety of ways. However, because they may be a little difficult to work with until they become comfortable with you, it is best if you have some level of experience working with horses before you attempt training one or riding on one. There are four different types of Mongolian horse. Overall, the Mongolian horse is an attractive breed with a unique appearance that helps to differentiate it from other breeds. For example, even though the Mongolian horse may be small like a pony, this is not a pony breed at all, and its small size is one of its defining features. It is also important to note that there are actually four different types of Mongolian horse, based upon the different regions in Mongolia from which they come. The types include the Steppe, Gobi, Mountain, and Forest. While the Steppe is faster and smaller, making it a great horse for riding, the Forest is the heaviest and largest of the four types. The Gobi is a desert horse, as well as the smallest, while the Mountain is the mid-sized type that has a similar body structure to the Altai Horse. When looking at a Mongolian horse, you may notice that these animals have large heads, short necks, and wide bodies. Their strong legs feature good joints but are short, and the hooves should be sound and hard. Overall, this stocky physique makes them energetic, strong, and athletic. And even though they are petite horses, the Mongolian has a high amount of stamina. Even though the Mongolian horse is small, it is not a pony breed. You can find the Mongolian horse in a wide range of colors, as people throughout the various regions in Mongolia tend to prefer certain colors over others, and they will breed their horses accordingly. All colors, such as roan, brown, white, gray, shun, bay, dun, black, and palomino, can be seen. Even though the Mongolian horse is known for being self-sufficient and these horses are left outside to fend for themselves even in rough conditions, if you are the proud owner of one of these horses, regular grooming sessions will help to ensure the animal\u2019s health and happiness. Plus, grooming is a great way to bond with your horse and develop a stronger level of trust, which is important. Whenever your horse gets too dirty for a basic grooming session, you could opt to use a gentle equine shampoo to give him a bath. Otherwise, you could use a combination of a curry comb, body finishing brush, dandy brush, and shedding blade to thoroughly remove dirt, debris, and loose hair from your horse\u2019s coat. A mane comb and tail brush will allow you to detangle and smooth out the mane and tail of your horse as well, and a hoof pick will be what you need to completely clean any debris from the hooves while checking for infections or injuries. Finally, when you need to clean around sensitive areas, such as the eyes and ears, a damp, soft cloth could do the trick.

The breeds that were mainly used to create this new breed include the Quarter Horse, the Arabian, and the Morgan. In the 1850s, L.L. Dorsey produced a stallion, known as Golddust, by crossing a stallion known as Vermont Morgan 69 with a mare of Arabian descent. Golddust went on to have 302 foals throughout his life, as well as other distant descendants, including a horse that was named Morab. Morab horses are a great choice for driving, trail riding, and other activities. In the latter part of the 1880s, the breeding of Morab horses was started in order to create a fine carriage horse that would also be able to do moderate farm labor. This is why the modern Morab Horse has both elegance and power, and they make great family horses and work horses. In the 1920s, the name Morab was created when William Randolph Hearst began his involvement in an equine breeding program for the herd he owned. He went on to produce horses that were of fine quality by crossing Morgan mares with Arabian stallions. Another Morab type was produced later, when the Swenson Brothers, who were based in Texas, crossed young Morgan broodmares and stallions with Arabian stock. The Morab Horse of America organization was started in the 1970s in Clovis, California by the Fuller family. This sparked curiosity from the public regarding Morgan-Arabian horse breeding, and shortly after, another organization, called the Hearst Memorial Morab Horse Association was formed. However, when the family closed their doors to the public around 1980, Clovis records were lost. Therefore, the North American Morab Horse Association was formed in the early part of the 1980s. It was active from 1984-1998, when the name was changed to Purebred Morab Horse Association, or PMHA. Throughout the years, Morab horses were mainly used as a way to improve other equine breeds. However, that has been changing recently, and these horses are bred, as well as trained, as a distinct equine breed today in the United States. Also, following selective breeding and training, today\u2019s Morab horses are some of the best choices for those seeking horses for driving, trail riding, and other activities. Because the Morab Horse has such a pleasant personality, it is an easy horse to work with and train. These animals are obedient, affectionate, and smart. They are also a great option for riders who do not have a lot of experience, as they have a calm and easygoing temperament and are easy to train for a variety of activities. Morab horses feature characteristics of the Morgan and Arabian breeds. Even though the Morab Horse can be described as elegant and refined, it does have considerable bone structure and strong muscles, making these horses powerful yet compact. The head of a Morab Horse will be polished and will feature the concave profile and the wide forehead of the Arabian, at least to some degree. The jaw will be muscular and the muzzle will be substantial, much like the Morgan Horse. Also, this horse\u2019s eyes will be expressive, bright, and large, while the ears, which can be tipped or fluted, will be alert and small. The neck of the Morab Horse should be arched, strong, and deep-set, and the back will be short with an undercarriage that is well developed. The hindquarters should be built powerfully, showcasing a lot of muscles and strong bones. The forequarters are also strong, and you will notice a deep, wide chest and sloping, large shoulders. The legs of this breed are quite thick. You will also note the short cannon bones, along with the well-developed and solid hooves. A lot of Morab horses will feature a mane and a tail that are quite thick, flowing, and wavy. They can also have a flagged tail carriage that is the result of the breed\u2019s Arabian and Morgan ancestry. The Morab Horse is elegant and compact, with strong muscles for power. The Morab Horse breed can feature all of the solid equine colors. These include bay, gray, chestnut, dun, buckskin, palomino, and roan. However, gray, chestnut, and bay are the most commonly seen colors. To groom your Morab Horse, a standard equine grooming practice will be sufficient, but you will need to take extra care if your horse\u2019s tail and mane are thick and wavy. You can also bathe your horse whenever necessary by using a gentle equine shampoo and conditioner. Use a combination of tools, including a curry comb, dandy brush, shedding blade, and body finishing brush, in order to thoroughly clean your horse\u2019s coat, massage the skin, and smooth your horse\u2019s appearance. Focus on detangling and smoothing out the lustrous tail and mane of this breed by using an appropriate mane comb and tail brush. Also, because tails and manes that are thick and wavy are often coarse and brittle, you can use a conditioner and detangler. Just be certain to rinse all of the shampoo out to avoid drying the hair. Ultimately, the more conditioned that your horse\u2019s tail and mane will be, the easier that they will be to manage.

The Morgan Horse was named after Figure\u2019s owner. The Morgan Horse is one of America\u2019s first native equine breeds. It is unclear what Figure\u2019s exact ancestry was, though some believe that he was a Welsh Cob. Others, however, believe that the horse descended instead from a racehorse named True Briton. But even though his history is unknown, Figure was known for being fast and strong in weight hauling and racing contests. As a result of Figure\u2019s unique abilities, the horse\u2019s reputation spread far and wide, and he quickly became an in-demand stud. Before long, Figure\u2019s descendents were utilized for harness racing and driving, and Morgan Horses were even used during the Civil War to pull canons. Modern Morgan Horses are still quite agile and strong, but they are also more refined. They make wonderful companions to anyone who loves being around horses, so it is no surprise that the Morgan is now one of the most beloved breeds in the United States, and these animals are also found all over the world.

These horses will feature a short head that has a wide forehead. The face could either showcase a flat profile or be a bit dished, but these horses never feature a roman nose that bends outward. Also, the eyes are bright and large, and the ears are nicely shaped and small. The muscular neck of the Morgan Horse complements the fact that these horses tend to hold the head up high. These animals also have angular, deep shoulders, a short and strong back, and a broad chest. Also, the horse\u2019s withers will be higher than the hips. And the tail and the mane are noticeably thick. In fact, one of the many characteristics that distinguish the Morgan Horse from other equine breeds is its long, flowing, beautiful tail. Some Morgans are also gaited, so they will have gaits that differ from the typical four gaits of gallop, canter, trot, and walk. The Morgan Horse is lighter than other equine breeds. Morgan Horses come in all colors. The wide range of colors that these horses display include chestnut, black, brown, bay, gray, white, dun, buckskin, palomino, perlino, cremello, and roan.

It was not until the famous Spanish Conquistador, Hernando Cortes, reintroduced horses to the continent that they began to roam freely again. In fact, during campaigns led by the Spanish in the New World, horses were often lost or would escape and became stray animals. Those horses would become known as the Mustang Horse. The American Mustang, which is now known as \u201cThe Symbol of the American West,\u201d derived its name from the Mexican word \u201cmestengo,\u201d which is derived from \u201cmeste\u00f1o,\u201d the Spanish term for \u201cferal\u201d or \u201cstray.\u201d The American Mustang is also known as \u201cThe Symbol of the American West.\u201d For almost two centuries, the wild horse population in North America was encouraged by the Spanish government, which would ship horses with the specific purpose to release them into the wild. This was done in order to deter Native Americans from stealing the horses of the Spanish settlers. Over 10,000 of these horses were released, and they spread throughout the west from the Rio Grande area. As they spread, they bred with other feral horses to create the Mustang Horse. Mustangs are a mix of the Andalusian, Arabian, and Barb horse breeds, and Native Americans were quick to adopt these horses in order to use them to hunt, to fight in battles, and to be easily transported from place to place. The animals were even used as bartering items. Americans also tried to improve the Mustang Horse during their migration to the west in the 1800s. Western ranchers would allow their horses to freely forage, and then they would end up taking in Mustangs that would join their own groups of horses. It was not until 1962 that the American Mustang Association, also known as the AMA, was created to serve as the registry for the American Mustang in San Diego, California. Today, a horse has to conform to the AMA\u2019s physical size and proportions standards, regardless of whether the ancestry or bloodline is pure. Because of its wild ancestry and personality, the Mustang Horse could be quite difficult to train initially. This breed is known for having a streak of independence that it is not afraid to show off. And this is especially true when American Mustangs are taken in from their wild habitats. Once an American Mustang is trained properly by an experienced horse handler, however, this highly intelligent breed will make a wonderful riding companion. These horses are willing to learn and work with their riders. Plus, they are also even tempered, so they can be used in a variety of ways, such as for endurance riding and for pleasure riding. The Mustang Horse is even tempered, so they can be used in a variety of ways, such as endurance and pleasure riding. The American Mustang Horse is truly lovely in appearance, with its symmetric and majestic carriage. It is easily noted that each body part is beautifully proportioned to the rest. This breed features a highly crested and long neck that will blend smoothly as it moves into the sloping shoulders. The Mustang Horse can also be identified by its head, which will narrow down into a fine muzzle, giving this horse a proud and unique appearance. Overall, the Mustang Horse has a muscular body that provides its strength, athleticism, and high endurance levels, but it is a lightweight breed. The horse\u2019s muscles are particularly noted in its defined legs, which are long, as well as in the back, which is straight. And, finally, these horses will feature rounded, compact hooves, along with a tail that is set low. Mustang horses come in a wide range of colors that include the standard horse colors.

In terms of grooming, the Mustang Horse is easy to care for. A regular grooming routine that includes brushing and washing your horse with shampoo and conditioner will ensure that you can bond with your animal and keep its coat looking smooth, healthy, and clean. A stiff-bristle or medium-bristle body brush, which is also referred to as a dandy brush, can be used to remove dirt, dust, and debris from a Mustang\u2019s coat. However, you should use a smaller brush with soft bristles along the horse\u2019s legs and face, which are sensitive areas. You can also use a curry comb in a circular motion in order to effectively remove any dirt that is stuck on the coat, as well as remove any loose hair.

But this pony is actually one of nine native breeds from the U.K. And it is believed that ponies have been grazing in the New Forest area for thousands of years. Experts also think that New Forest Ponies, in particular, have been living there since 1016, but it is difficult to trace the exact origins of this pony breed. Over time, New Forest Ponies mixed with quite a few other equine breeds, either naturally or as a result of human intervention. And it is believed that, from around the 1800s onward, several equine breeds were used to help improve the New Forest Pony bloodline. The breeds that mixed with the New Forest Pony included the Thoroughbred and the Arabian, as well as the Welsh Pony, the Dartmoor Pony, and the Exmoor Pony. Others included the Hackney Horse, the Fell Pony, the Dales Pony, and the Highland Pony. As a result, the New Forest Pony has genes that are more diverse than other British equine breeds. However, the breed was also influenced by the environment that it lived in, so these animals have become rather hardy and tough. The New Forest Pony has a friendly and docile temperament. Today, the New Forest Pony is a popular breed around the world, as these horses have been exported to countries including Australia, the United States, France, Sweden, and Canada, as a few examples, since the 1950s. These ponies can be used as driving horses and as leisure horses, and they also do well in areas like jumping and dressage, thanks to their physique and personality. One of the many reasons why the New Forest Pony has become such a popular breed is because of its friendly and docile temperament. These gentle yet strong and sturdy ponies are typically easy to train, and they are also multi-talented, intelligent, quiet, versatile, and willing to please. Plus, compared to other native pony breeds from the British Isles, the New Forest Pony is the one that is the least afraid of people. For these reasons, the ponies can be used in everything from endurance riding and general riding, to jumping, work, and dressage. When it comes to height, the New Forest Pony doesn\u2019t have a lower limit. When it comes to height, the New Forest Pony actually does not have a lower limit. But the maximum height for this breed is 14.2 hands. Also, when you look at the body of a New Forest Pony, you might even notice that this breed is more like a horse than a pony. And these ponies are considered hardy with straight action. A New Forest Pony should feature strong quarters and sloping shoulders, along with a short back, short neck, and long head. You will also notice good depth, feet that are round and hard, and limbs that are straight. The body should be strong enough to carry an adult, as well as narrow enough to carry a small child. However, smaller New Forest Ponies likely won\u2019t be able to carry adults at all. The New Forest Pony is hardy and strong. Most often, the New Forest Pony is either gray, chestnut, or bay in color. However, the New Forest Pony could actually showcase any color except cream with blue eyes, skewbald, and piebald. Also, light chestnut and palomino, as well as cream with dark eyes, are ineligible as licensed stallions, so you will only find mares and geldings sporting light chestnut and palomino colors. Blue eyes are never permitted, and there are also limitations with regards to white markings. For example, white markings are only allowed on the lower legs and on the head, as long they are not behind the head, above the metacarpal bone of the foreleg at the bend in the pony\u2019s knee, or above the area of the pony\u2019s hock on the hind leg. When it comes to grooming your New Forest Pony, the same basic routine that could be used for any other horse breed will be sufficient. Investing in an equine grooming kit that contains various brushes will allow you to get the job done while bonding with your pet. Plus, every grooming session is a great opportunity to examine your pony\u2019s body and hooves for any signs of infection or injuries that need to be treated promptly. Using with a curry comb is a good way to start your pony\u2019s grooming session. Using circular movements, you could use this comb to remove debris, dirt, and excess hair from your pet\u2019s body. A body finishing brush could help you clean more sensitive areas like your pony\u2019s legs while removing even more debris and loose hair. And a shedding blade, along with a dandy brush, could both be used to clean the coat even more. Once your pony\u2019s coat is clean and shiny, you could use a damp, soft cloth to clean around the eyes and ears. A mane comb and a tail brush could also be used to ensure your pony\u2019s mane and tail are free of tangles and look soft and smooth. Finally, a hoof pick could be used to completely clean out the hooves.

Since then, this unique equine breed has evolved, particularly in order to fulfill the needs of humans throughout various time periods. In the latter part of the 1500s, Count Johann XVI von Oldenburg decided to create the Oldenburg breed, which would be based on the Friesian that was primarily used as a harness horse. The Friesian would serve as the foundation breed to make way for a lighter horse that would be ideal for riding as well. Count Anton Gunter von Oldenburg, his successor, further refined this breed by incorporating more blood from lighter breeds that were arriving from areas like Italy, England, Spain, and Turkey. Oldenburg horses display an air of nobility, and have evolved into a popular sport breed. Throughout the 1600s and 1700s, the Oldenburg Horse became quite popular in various parts of Europe, and this led to indiscriminate breeding. There were over 16,000 horses in Europe in 1784, and private breeders were able to establish a studbook in 1861 in order to properly register breeding stock, as well as boost the quality of this breed as a way to meet the demands of the cavalry and coach lines. Once the railway was introduced, harness horses were no longer needed as much, so the Oldenburg Horse breed was developed further in order to enhance the \u201cGerman Riding Horse\u201d concept. This called for the horse to have ground covering movement, a spirited yet kind personality, and elegance. In 1983, the International Sporthorse Registry/Oldenburg Registry of North America, also known as ISR/OLD NA, was founded in order to approve and maintain Oldenburg Horse registration. Today, the Oldenburg Horse is a breed that is powerful, reliable, and versatile. These popular horses display an air of nobility, and they have evolved and adapted into a competitive sport breed that still retains some of the characteristic knee action of its harness horse ancestors. Even though the Oldenburg Horse is large in stature, it is not an intimidating breed or one that is difficult to work with or manage. In fact, the Oldenburg is known for having a pleasant and attractive personality, making it an easy animal to work with.

The neck is strong and long, the chest is deep, and the horse is also well muscled through the hindquarters, back, and shoulders. A combination of large and compact in stature, this horse breed is powerful and muscular from front to back. You will also note a high set tail, flat croup, and legs that are strong and feature thick, short bones. Even the hooves are big in order to bear the weight of this heavy breed.

Pay extra attention to this horse\u2019s large hooves in order to ensure that they are kept free of debris, dirt, and rocks. Use a hoof pick and inspect the hooves whenever you groom your horse to be certain that there aren\u2019t any injuries or infections developing. To keep the Oldenburg Horse\u2019s coat looking healthy, you can use a curry comb in order to remove dirt, debris, and loose hair easily and efficiently. A dandy brush can remove even more loose hair, mud, and dirt from the coat, while a body finishing brush could be used on the horse\u2019s face and legs, which are typically more sensitive than other parts of the body. Follow these tools up with a shedding blade if you need to remove excess hair from the coat until it is totally smooth. Finally, you can use a mane comb to clean out the mane and keep it free of tangles before using a tail brush to maintain the beauty, smoothness, and cleanliness of the tail.

In fact, it is Russia\u2019s most famous horse breed, and at one time, it was also the fastest harness horse in all of Europe. Developed towards the end of the 18th century, this equine breed was originally used as a light harness horse, displaying both endurance and speed. It is named after the breed\u2019s creator, Count A.G. Orlov. He was responsible for establishing the Khrenovsky Stud, which would be the foundation for this new breed. The farm that A.G. Orlov used is still open today. The Orlov Trotter is Russia\u2019s most famous horse breed. In the 1770s, Orlov wanted to develop an equine breed that would be able to tolerate the severe climate in Russia. He also needed a horse that would be able to travel long distances and that would be able to handle the terrible roads in the country as well. Therefore, he focused on creating a new breed that would have a lot of endurance and would feature a long-strided trot. And on top of all of that, he wanted the horse to also be attractive. Thanks to his expert knowledge of equines, his prestige, and his wealth, Orlov was able to acquire the finest horses from Persia, Arabia, the Caucasus, Turkey, Italy, Poland, Spain, Germany, Denmark, England, and Holland. The most famous of these acquisitions, however, was the Arabian stallion named Smetanka. This silver-gray beauty was long-backed and large for his breed, and he even had an extra rib, along with an ideal trot. In a mere three generations, Orlov was able to create horses that exhibited the essential traits of what would be known as the Orlov Trotter. He kept meticulous performance and breeding records, as well as thousands of horses, and he also worked with many different potential lines at once. In the 1830s, the monopoly on Orlov Trotter breeding started to break down. By the middle of the century, Orlov Trotters were being bred throughout Russia. And throughout the majority of the 19th century, no other equine trotting breed on the planet was able to match the Orlov Trotter\u2019s stamina, hardiness, and speed. As a result, these horses developed a positive reputation and grew popular throughout Europe. In addition to being used in sport racing, and essentially introducing harness racing in Russia, they were also used as carriage horses. Throughout the 20th century, Orlov Trotter bloodlines were diluted as these horses were bred with other horses, such as the American Standardbred. Situations like war also took their toll on the Orlov Trotter\u2019s genetic pool. As a result, enthusiasts are working hard at preserving this breed today. Despite its large size, power, surefootedness, agility, and speed, the Orlov Trotter can be considered a gentle giant, which is one of the many reasons why it is such a popular and unique breed. These horses are highly versatile, so they can be trained to perform a variety of tasks. They are also willing animals that are happy to work. The quiet temperament of the Orlov Trotter makes it a wonderful companion, whether you need a work horse, a sport horse, or a riding horse. Orlov Trotters are born with a darker coat that changes with maturity. When you look at an Orlov Trotter, you will notice that the horse has a large head with expressive, large eyes. The neck is naturally arched and long, and the chest is broad and deep. The body features well-sprung ribs and a long back, and it is muscular throughout. The legs are also strong, featuring tendons that are clearly defined, along with joints that are also prominent. Overall, this breed is impressive, and it is very fast and agile. Its body allows it to be powerful, light, and elegant all at the same time. However, there are four main types of Orlov Trotters, and they are based upon their size. These are the large/massive, the large/rangy, the medium sized, and the average. Orlov Trotters are willing horses that are happy to work. The Orlov Trotter features several different coat colors that include white, black, chestnut, gray, and bay. Many, however, will be gray when they reach maturity because of their Arabian ancestry. Only roughly 5% of these horses will have a chestnut colored coat. All of the horses, regardless of what color they display as adults, are actually born with a darker coat. When it comes to grooming an Orlov Trotter, you can follow the same standard grooming process that you would use with any other horse. A hoof pick will ensure the horse\u2019s hooves can be kept clean and free of injuries and infections, while a tail comb and mane brush will ensure that the hairs will remain soft, smooth, and tangle free.

The characteristically golden horse with the tail and mane of an ivory hue has been mentioned in the legends of several different countries. The horse even appears in the ancient paintings and tapestries of Asia and Europe. These horses also made history during the Crusades, and they were even highly favored by Spain\u2019s famous Queen Isabella, who shipped a Palomino stallion, along with five mares, to Mexico. From there, these unique and beautiful horses spread into Texas and then into California. At that point in time, Native Americans began capturing the Palomino Horses in order to use them for warfare, transportation, and hunting. Palomino horses are gentle, easy to train, and easy to work with in a variety of settings. The name Palomino is actually a Spanish surname, and many horse experts believe that the Palomino is not really an equine breed on its own, but rather a color that can describe a horse, regardless of its breed. This is because the coloration known as Palomino is found in a variety of horse breeds. However, the Golden Dorado, which was the Palomino of Spain, could be considered a breed that was a mix of Arabic, Moorish, and Spanish blood, much like the Moorish Barb and the Arabian horse breeds. In other words, a true Palomino Horse could actually be a descendent of that original Spanish stock of Moorish Barbs and Arabians after all, rather than just being a color. Trigger and Mr. Ed are a couple of examples of modern Palomino horses that became stars on TV and in movies, proving that these horses are gentle, easy to train, and easy to work with in a variety of settings. The Palomino Horse is most often described based upon its coat color, rather than as a breed of its own. Therefore, it is difficult to determine what traits these horses will showcase. In other words, because Palomino Horses can actually be found within a variety of equine breeds, the temperaments and personalities can vary widely between these horses, and will ultimately depend upon the breed of an individual horse. The Palomino Horse is most often described based upon its coat color, rather than as a breed of its own. Generally, the Palomino Horse can perform a variety of tasks, thanks to its endurance, maneuverability, and versatility. As mentioned above, when defining a Palomino simply by its color, the horse\u2019s physique and physical description will vary, depending upon its actual breed, as the Palomino color can occur in several equine breeds. To register a horse as a Palomino, it has to display a coat color that is similar to gold, though variations of three shades darker or lighter can also be accepted. The tail and the mane must also be nearly white or totally white, thereby creating a sharp contract. The skin of a Palomino should be golden or dark in color, and these horses can also display white on the face if it is in the form of a star, snip, or blaze. If there is any white hair on the legs of the horse, it should not extend above the hocks and knees. White is not allowed anywhere else on the horse\u2019s body, and the coat should also have a unique iridescence that shines. The coloring of these beautiful horses is the result of what is known as the cream gene, or a cream dilution gene. The coloring of these beautiful horses is the result of what is known as the cream gene, or a cream dilution gene. This gives the animal a chestnut base coat and a cream color. The color can actually range from a creamy white to a darker brown. However, this horse breed will also showcase the characteristic white tail and mane that provides a beautiful contrast to the color on the rest of the body. The grooming requirements for a Palomino Horse are the same as for any other horse breed. It is a good idea to groom your horse daily in order to bond with your animal and ensure that its coat will remain beautifully shiny and smooth, as well as clean of debris and loose hair. To groom a Palomino, you can use a medium-bristle or a stiff-bristle body brush to remove all of the debris, dust, and dirt from the body. Then use a smaller, soft-bristled brush on the Palomino\u2019s delicate face and legs, before utilizing a curry comb to remove excess dirt and loose hair that the first brush did not remove effectively enough. Just make sure to use the curry comb in a circular motion for the best results.

Both the Peruvian Paso and Paso Fino breeds have the same roots, as they date back to the same set of horses that were brought to the Americas by Spanish conquistadors. The Spanish Jennet bloodline exists in both the Peruvian Paso Horse and the Paso Fino Horse, and both of these breeds were created for their beauty, strength, and stamina, but especially for their smooth and comfortable gait. Paso Fino horses are known for their friendly, docile, and social personalities. Historically, those horses that ended up traveling to Peru remained isolated there. But in Colombia and Puerto Rico, as well as other Latin American and Caribbean nations, another set of conquistador horses existed. Both sets of horses kept their uniquely smooth four-beat gait, but over time, they developed into different breeds. Also, the way that the horses execute the gait has become an important distinction between the Paso Fino Horse and the Peruvian Paso Horse. The Paso Fino Horse\u2019s ancestry includes the Spanish Jennet, which arrived with Columbus in the Dominican Republic, as well as the Andalusian and the Barb. In the 1950s, the United States Army became impressed by the smooth and comfortable ride offered by the Paso Fino Horse, so they started importing the horses into the country. In 1972, the first national association was created for the Paso Fino, and it was named the Paso Fino Horse Association. Also known as PFHA, this association was set up to protect, improve, and promote the unique breed.

The breed has highly stylized, natural gaits that include the paso largo (which is the fastest), the paso corto (which has the speed of a trot and is the preferred gait), and the paso fino (which is the slowest). Today\u2019s Paso Fino is still a close representation of the Spanish Jennet, although breeds like the American Saddlebred, the Morgan, and the Arabian were added occasionally to the horse\u2019s bloodline in order to increase its size over time. This breed is medium in size, and it features a small head with widely set eyes. The shoulders can be seen sloping down, and the withers are of varying lengths and clean. The legs of this horse are sleek and strong, and the hooves are small. Many of these horses also have uncommonly large tails and manes.

Some experts think that these horses are descendants of the horses that were found within the Le Perche region of France as far back as the Ice Age. Others think that the breed is related to the Boulannais Horse that was utilized during the invasion of Brittany. And other experts believe that this equine breed is actually descended from the Barb stallions that were utilized by the Moors when they invaded and were defeated in the Battle of Tours, leaving their horses behind. What is known, however, is that native mares living in Le Perche mated with Arab stallions at two points in history. These were during the 8th century and the Middle Ages. And when the crusades occurred, the Percheron breed was recognized for its soundness, substance, style, and beauty. The Percheron Horse is a large draft breed that exhibits more energy than other draft horses. As commerce and trade grew in the 1700s, Percheron horses grew increasingly popular as both farm horses and coach horses. Heavy draft horses were also in greater demand, as they were necessary to move large, heavy loads from railheads and docks, and the Percheron was built for the task. This horse breed also became a favorite in America. More than 2,500 mares and nearly 5,000 stallions were sent to America from Le Perche, and in 1876, Percheron breeders decided to meet in Chicago to form the Norman-Percheron Association and to start the first stud book. A year later, the Norman part of the name was dropped, and the Percheron Society of America came into effect in 1905 and lasted until 1934. Today\u2019s association is known as the Percheron Horse Association of America. The Percheron Horse is a large draft breed that exhibits more energy than other draft horses, and these animals are known for their pleasing personality, work ethic, and friendliness. When working with a Percheron Horse, you can expect that it will be alert, willing, proud, and intelligent. This horse is easy to keep, adaptable, and versatile, so it can be used in a variety of ways. Because these horses are even-tempered and strong, trainers and riders of all levels will enjoy working with Percherons, especially if they are comfortable handling larger horses. Unlike other draft breeds, the Percheron doesn\u2019t have heavy feathering on the fetlocks. Percherons feature thighs that are notably muscular, and it is these muscles that give the horse its immense pulling power, good balance, and clean action. These horses are also deep and wide through the chest, they have well sprung ribs, and they have a level croup and large, round hips. Other characteristics include large eyes, a full and broad forehead, and a straight face with a strong jaw. The ears are set attractively on the head, and they are also refined. Mares will have a more feminine appearance, while the stallions will have a more rugged look. Unlike other draft breeds, the Percheron does not have the heavy feathering that is typically found on the fetlocks. Percheron horses are known for their pleasing personality, work ethic, and friendliness. The Percheron Horse comes in a variety of colors, but you will usually see black and gray horses. Sorrel, bay, roan, and chestnut are also possible. A lot of these horses will also showcase white markings on the feet and head, but excessive patches of white are not desirable for this breed. British and American Percherons are typically black or gray, but French Percheron horses are born with a black coat that transforms into a gray color by the age of 3. Every horse requires a regular grooming routine that will maintain the health and beauty of its coat and skin. However, good grooming is especially important to the Percheron, whose coat can become heavy when the climate is cold. Care should also be taken to ensure the thick mane is kept clean and free of tangles. And the hair that is found around this horse\u2019s ankles could attract bacteria from the soil and make the animal susceptible to pododermatitis. In addition to standard equine grooming tools, you may need a stool or a small stepladder to reach the top of your Percheron Horse, as these animals are tall. Use a curry comb to remove dirt and loose hair, as well as a body finishing brush to clean sensitive areas on the horse\u2019s body, such as the face and the legs. You can also use a dandy brush to remove mud and dirt while loosening excess hair for easier removal with a shedding blade.

When noblemen from Spain settled throughout the Caribbean and South America, many of those horses went with them on the journey. This was the start of the Peruvian Paso Horse breed. A major export of the horses took place in the 1400s, but a surge in their shipment also took place in the middle of the 1500s. As a result, the Peruvian Paso Horse of today is a descendent of those Spanish Jennets. Peruvian Paso Horses are willing to please their owners and riders. When the conquistadors brought Spanish stock horses to South America in the 1500s, the Peruvian Paso Horse was created for the people who needed horses that would be easy to ride for extended periods of time and over long distances, including difficult mountain terrain. Spanish Jennets were recognized for their gaits, so the Peruvian Paso provides a comfortable ride. But other horse breeds, such as the Andalusian and the Barb, helped make the Peruvian Paso a horse with a high level of strength and stamina as well. Peruvian horse breeders were able to maintain the bloodline of the Peruvian Paso for hundreds of years by selectively breeding the horses for their conformation, temperament, and gait. Only the horses with the best gaits were bred, and there was no need to cross the horses with other breeds. Once highways and cars came onto the scene, however, the Peruvian Paso horse was used much less to get around in the 1900s, particularly in southern Peru. Also, when the Agrarian Reforms were introduced by the Peruvian government in the 1960s, large Peruvian Paso breeding ranches were shut down and they lost the breeding stock. A lot of the best horses were then shipped to Central America and the United States. Over the last 30 years, the Peruvian Paso horse has become more common in Peru again. Today, the Peruvian Paso Horse is one of the last breeds that is naturally gaited. Peruvian Paso Horses are willing to please their owners and riders, and they are known for being responsive, so they make wonderful companions to riders of all experience levels. These horses are also gentle and friendly, and they are docile, so they will work well with beginner riders, as well as anyone else who is seeking an equine companion who will be easy to work with and provide a comfortable and smooth ride.

The back should be short to medium in length, as well as rounded and strong. The loins of this horse should be muscular over the area of the kidneys, and they should be broad. Also, the croup should be wide and long, fairly muscular, nicely rounded, and with a moderate slope. The chest should be muscular and wide, the rib cage should be deep and well sprung, and the flanks should be deep, full, and moderately short. Also, the Peruvian Paso features a head that is medium in size, with a slightly concave or straight profile. The neck should have a graceful arch and be of medium length. The muzzle should be small, the nostrils should be oblong, and the eyes should be set apart, dark, and expressive. The horse\u2019s jowls are marked moderately, and the ears are of a medium length and feature fine tips that will curve inward slightly. The tail will be set low and will be carried straight and close to the body. One of the most unique features of the Peruvian Paso, however, is the fact that all of the purebred foals will have the breed\u2019s characteristic smooth gait.

The horses were brought to America by settlers, and they were eventually domesticated by the Native Americans, who preferred these horses because their color pattern acted as camouflage in the environment. Pinto can actually refer to any equine breed that exhibits tobiano, overo, and tovero color patterns. However, the most common breeds that exhibit these particular color patterns include the Icelandic Horse, the Mustang, the Arabian, and the Saddlebred Horse. The Pinto Horse is bred for its color pattern. Even though spotted horses appear to have originated with the horses of American Indians, the two-toned pattern that is so distinctive on the coat of a Pinto Horse likely arrived in North America via the Spanish and Arabian stock that came with the early explorers. Native Americans preferred the horses\u2019 spotted color and ended up breeding the horses for this particular characteristic. Later, Western settlers bred their horses with Indian ponies, and this allowed for the unique color pattern to continue. Even though the Paint and Pinto breeds are lumped together a lot, they are not the same breed. This is because the American Paint Horse has to have original stock blood from a Thoroughbred or an American Quarter Horse. The Pinto Horse, on the other hand, is considered a color breed. Therefore, these horses can have any parents of any breeds, as long as the coat requirements for the Pinto are fulfilled. Even though the Pinto color can happen in any horse breed, the Pinto Horse Association of America will not accept any horses with Draft, mule, or Appaloosa characteristics or breeding. The Pinto Horse is bred for its color pattern. As a result, many different equine breeds can exhibit the Pinto appearance. When it comes to breed traits, therefore, it is difficult to narrow down the exact personality of a Pinto Horse, as that will ultimately depend upon the breed of a Pinto Horse. Generally, however, the breeds that exhibit the Pinto pattern are intelligent, trainable, and easygoing, as well as versatile, strong, and athletic. There is a Pinto Horse for every type of rider and for horse owners of all experience levels. Also, the Pinto Horse is multi-talented and can be used in a variety of settings and for a variety of tasks. There is a Pinto Horse for every type of rider and for horse owners of all experience levels. Because the Pinto is bred for its coloring, there is also no set conformation that will make a horse a Pinto. In other words, any equine breed, from a Thoroughbred to a Miniature Horse, could be a Pinto as long as it has the right colors and patterns. But even though the Pinto Horse does not have a consistent conformation because it is bred for its color, there are four types of conformation that are acknowledged. The Pinto conformations that are acknowledged are the Stock type, the Hunter type, the Pleasure type, and the Saddle type. The Stock type has a Quarter Horse conformation, while the Hunter is predominantly Racing Quarter Horse, warmblood, or Thoroughbred conformation. The Pleasure will have a Morgan or Arabian conformation, while the Saddle will have a Tennessee Walking Horse, Hackney, or Saddlebred conformation. Tobiano and overo are the two most common colors for Pinto Horses. A horse with a white body and large areas of color all over the whole body will be categorized as tobiano. On the other hand, a horse that has a base color and exhibits uneven markings of white on the sides of the body is considered overo. Also, if the darker color on the Pinto Horse is black, it is described as a Piebald, but if the darker color on the horse is any color other than black, it will be described as a Skewbald. A tovero color pattern can occur from breeding an overo with a tobiano horse. In the majority of cases, doing so will create a coat pattern that is actually a mix of both the tobiano and the overo patterns. The Pinto Horse is multi-talented and can be used in a variety of settings and for a variety of tasks. The Pinto Horse requires regular grooming in order to maintain its beautiful appearance and keep its coat healthy. You can purchase a set of horse grooming tools that includes a body finishing brush, a curry comb, a dandy brush, a mane comb, a shedding blade, a tail brush, and a hoof pick. Use the body finishing brush for the face and legs, the curry comb to remove dirt and loose hair, the dandy brush to remove even more mud, dirt, and loose hair, and the mane comb to smooth out the mane.

The first time that this breed\u2019s ancestors were bred was prior to the American Civil War, and they were found throughout the southern plantations of the US. Over time, the Racking Horse was developed in much the same way as the Tennessee Walking Horse, and its ancestors were renowned for their versatility, good nature, and intelligence. The Racking Horse features a natural single-foot gait. Throughout the 1800s, these horses were common in equine shows in the southeast, in addition to still being utilized as comfortable riding horses, particularly over long distances. At that time, however, Racking horses were only known as another type of Tennessee Walking Horse, rather than being recognized as a breed of their own. It was not until the 1960s that an association was formed for the Racking Horse by Joe D. Bright of Alabama and a group of businessmen. They worked on creating the Racking Horse Breeders\u2019 Association (RHBA), thereby making it a separate breed. However, the association was not formally approved by the USDA until 1971. Also, in the latter part of the 1960s, Bright had initiated a program for breeding and raising the Racking Horse for pleasure riding and horse shows.

In addition to brushing, you can bathe your horse with an equine shampoo if he becomes very dirty. And every grooming session is an ideal opportunity to bond with your horse, who will thoroughly enjoy the attention and affection that you can provide. First, use a curry comb all over the horse\u2019s body in order to bring dust, dirt, and other debris to the surface and make it even easier to remove. Always use circular movements, and work your way from the horse\u2019s head down to his hindquarters. Just be aware that certain areas of the body, such as the legs and face, as well as bony areas along the hips and shoulders, might be sensitive, so you can switch to a body finishing brush for those areas. Next, you can use a dandy brush to bring even more debris and dirt to the surface of the animal\u2019s coat. With a flicking motion, as well as short strokes, you can use this tool to remove the dirt from the head all the way to the hindquarters. Repeat this stage, as necessary, until all of the dirt has been removed. Then, using long strokes, you can finish by moving over the horse\u2019s whole body once more. Grab your body finishing brush to make the horse\u2019s coat shine by using energetic movements all over the body. This will smooth down the horse\u2019s hair while creating a shine as natural oils are distributed. Be sure to use strokes that are even and long. Using a soft sponge or cloth, you can gently wash the areas around your Racking Horse\u2019s eyes and ears with some water. Then use a hoof pick to gently remove any debris, such as dirt, mud, and rocks, that has accumulated within them from everyday activity. Finally, to make sure that your horse\u2019s mane and tail will always look smooth and beautiful, use a mane comb and a tail brush to remove any tangles.

The beginnings of the breed date back to around the 1800s, but only a verbal history, which has been passed down through the generations, remains. It is believed that the Rocky Mountain Horse, which is easy-gaited and sure-footed, originated in the latter part of the 1800s in the United States. More specifically, the breed started off in eastern Kentucky, within the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The horses were used for a variety of purposes, including for riding, herding cattle, and plowing fields. They were worked hard because they were a necessity to the rural inhabitants of the area. Rocky Mountain horses are known for their gentle attitude. Because these horses\u2019 owners were not wealthy, the animals did not receive any special care, and many of the weak horses could not survive. These horses also had to adapt in order to withstand the harsh winters with minimal shelter, and some even had to survive on whatever food they were able to find, even if it meant eating tree bark like deer. According to the Rocky Mountain Horse Association, a gaited colt was taken to eastern Kentucky from the Rocky Mountain region of the United States around 1890. This animal was called the Rocky Mountain Horse by locals, and he is the individual horse that has been credited with starting the breed by the same name. However, little is actually known about this foundation stallion, which was bred with local Appalachian saddle horses in a small area before the line of horses grew in number in the years that followed. Rocky Mountain horses eventually became treasured possessions, thanks to their easy gait and their ability to work in all seasons and conditions. However, it was Sam Tuttle\u2019s farm in Spout Springs, Kentucky where these animals were able to find a nurturing place to live. He became the prominent breeder of these horses throughout the 20th century, and he maintained a sizable herd on his farm even during the toughest times. Therefore, he is the man who is most responsible for allowing the Rocky Mountain Horse breed to survive.

Later, in 1914, these horses were recognized as half-blood horses, and they were seen in even more regions throughout France. As a result, different types of horses were typically named after the region that they were bred in. It was not until 1958 that the Selle Fran\u00e7ais Horse was created by bringing all of the half-blood regional horses throughout France together and giving them a single name. The different types included the Charolais, the Vendeen, and the Anglo-Norman. This merger was completed in an effort to develop a sport horse breed that would be able to fulfill the demands of a society that needed the animals for sport and leisure. The Selle Fran\u00e7ais Horse is also known as the French Saddle Horse. Because many different local horses were crossed with Anglo-Arabians, French Trotters, and Thoroughbreds, the first Selle Fran\u00e7ais horses were genetically diverse, with the Norman origins being the most obvious. Over time, however, this breed has become increasingly more refined and has become a sought-after sport horse. In 2003, the National Association of French Saddle Horses became the approved breed association for the Selle Fran\u00e7ais.

For sensitive areas like the lower legs and the head, however, don\u2019t use a curry comb; instead, use a body brush, which is a gentler tool that will help you remove even more dirt and dust from the coat. Then you can also use a dandy brush to get the coat totally clean by using swiping and flicking motions. And when you have gotten the coat to be shiny, sleek, and clean, you could move on to the tail and the mane by using a mane comb and a tail brush to remove all of the tangles and get the hair to be smooth and soft.

In fact, excavations in that part of the world show that small ponies lived on the Shetland Isles from as far back as the Bronze Age. Written records of Shetland Ponies seem to have begun in 1603, and the first written record of this breed was in the Court Books of Shetland. Some people believe that Shetland Ponies are the result of Vikings crossing their horses with native ponies. Others believe it\u2019s possible that this pony was able to evolve over time on the Scandinavian tundra after being brought to the area by the Vikings. And still other experts think that the most likely theory for the Shetland Pony is that the animals originated in Scandinavia before crossing ice fields that used to connect Britain with Scandinavia. The Shetland Ponies were then domesticated, and the native ponies were bred with lighter ponies brought to the islands by Norse settlers. The breed may also have been influenced by Celtic ponies between 2000 B.C. and 1000 B.C. The Shetland Pony is one of the most popular horse breeds, especially for children. The Shetland Pony is very small, but it is also hardy and strong, and it can survive on sparse grazing. These characteristics have allowed the breed to overcome the harsh winters of the Shetland Islands for hundreds of years. Shetland Ponies were used for pulling carts, and they were also utilized as pit ponies in coal mines in the 19th century throughout the United States and England. However, they became quite popular as ponies that children could ride, and they were later used as driving ponies as well. It was not until 1890 that the Shetland Pony Stud Book Society was formed. At that time, the Shetland Pony became the first pony to have a breed society of its own. Exportation of Shetland Ponies to various areas throughout the United Kingdom, as well as other countries abroad, began at the end of the 19th century. As a result, the Shetland Pony can be found in several countries around the world today. The Shetland Pony is one of the most popular horse breeds, especially for children.

The rest of the body also features a double coat that is thick and provides additional warmth when the temperature drops. Shetland Ponies in the US are more refined and a bit larger than those found in the UK. American Shetlands are also lighter and leaner, and they feature longer legs and a thinner neck, making them more athletic and agile, with a high-stepping action and longer stride.

The Great Horse was a heavy war horse that was bred from the cold-blooded equines of central Europe in order to bravely and calmly carry knights into battle in the 11th century. These animals were known for being large and for featuring hindquarters that were massive, but they were actually smaller in size when compared to the draft breeds that would develop from them. As the need for war horses carrying knights declined, and as wheeled forms of transportation were developed, there was a new requirement. This time, it was for horses that would be strong enough to pull heavy loads with ease. As a result, carthorses were developed, and the Great Horse was used as a foundation for those new equine breeds. Even though the Shire Horse is so large, it is known for being a gentle giant. Evidence also points to the fact that black Flemish horses with leg feathering were brought to England in the early part of the 13th century. Therefore, those horses also influenced the Shire Horse\u2019s development. Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire are typically recognized as the first places where Shire breeding took place. It was not until the middle of the1800s that the Shire Horse was imported to the United States. And in 1885, the American Shire Horse Association was created. Even though the Shire Horse is so large, it is known for being a gentle giant. These animals are laid-back, calm, and docile. They are also easy to train, despite their size, so they are suitable for all levels of horse owners, riders, and trainers, including beginners. In fact, shying, rearing, bucking, and spooking are rare behaviors for this breed. However, taller riders may feel more comfortable on these massive horses. Shire horses are also popular because they aim to please. They do not mind being around other animals, such as dogs, and they are even comfortable around loud noises, water, cars, and children. Overall, this breed has a mellow personality and state of mind that is typically attributed to the fact that it was originally created to work as a war horse. That occupation required that the animals stay calm and even-tempered during the most chaotic and dangerous situations, and those traits have been passed down through the generations to modern Shire horses.

Groom a Shire Horse with care, just as you would any other horse, and spend time cleaning the coat thoroughly to remove dirt, dust, and other debris. Because this horse is taller than most, you may need to use a stool or a stepladder to access all of the areas throughout the horse\u2019s body that need to be groomed. Using a curry comb, you can remove loose dirt and hair with ease. A dandy brush can also be used to loosen more dirt, mud, and hair from the coat. A body finishing brush is ideal for the face and legs, which are sensitive areas, and you can also invest in a mane comb and tail brush specifically for those areas of the horse\u2019s body. A shedding blade can remove excess hair, and a hoof pick will effectively remove dirt and debris, including rocks, from the horse\u2019s large hooves. To keep the feathers on a Shire Horse\u2019s lower legs looking healthy and clean, you can spray on a detangling product designed for equines.

Thoroughbred Horses have bold and spirited personalities that are not suitable for riders and owners who do not have experience. The three principle pedigree bloodlines of the Thoroughbred Horse were the Byerly Turk, the Darley Arabian, and the Godolphin Arabian.

A royal stud farm was opened for breeding purposes at Trakehnen in East Prussia, and he crossed petite native mares, known as Schwaike, with Thoroughbred horses that came from England and purebred Arabian horses. A variety of other equine breeds were tried throughout the years, but the stud directors eventually limited the options to the Arabian and the Thoroughbred. As a result, a horse breed was developed that fulfilled all of the king\u2019s wishes. And as a result of strict selection, only the best horses were allowed to breed. Horses that were considered merely \u201caverage\u201d were sold in order to be used as riding horses. Trakehner horses are beloved for their appealing, stable, and charming personality. Over time, horses that were born at Trakehnen were referred to simply as Trakehner horses. This distinguished them from the East Prussians that were being produced by breeders who purchased mares from Trakehnen and then bred those with Trakehner stallions. Ever since the conclusion of World War II, all horses that have Trakehnen or East Prussian bloodlines are referred to as Trakehners. Many horses from East Prussia did not make it through the war, but Dr. Fritz Schilke, who was the executive director of the East Prussian Stud Book Society, attempted to locate all of the horses that were able to make it to the West. Two years after the war ended, in 1947, he was successful in creating the West German Trakehner Verband, as well as a Trakehner Stud Book, to continue documenting the breed. Despite the horses being displaced from their homes and being exposed to different conditions, the Trakehner remained unchanged. Today, the breed is found throughout the world. The American Trakehner Association was created in 1974 in order to keep track of this breed throughout North America. The association signed an agreement with the German Trakehner Verband in order to breed these horses in North America using the same selective breeding standards, as well as performance testing principles, as those used in Germany. The Trakehner Horse is beloved for its appealing, stable, and charming personality. These horses are good natured, alert, loyal, active, eager to please, friendly, even-tempered, intelligent, and kind, and they also have plenty of energy and athleticism. Because these horses can be quite powerful and athletic, especially in their movements, they might not be the best choice for casual riding or for beginners who do not have experience in working with horses. For those who do have the right experience, however, these horses are willing to be trained and can be used in a variety of ways. The Trakehner is the most refined and lightest of all warmblood horses. Trakehner horses can be described as having a rectangular build. You will notice long and sloping shoulders, a well set and crested neck that is medium to long in size, and short cannon bones. Also, the hindquarters are flatter, there is a croup that is gently sloped, and the chest should be deep, while the back is short and straight. The head of the Trakehner is refined, elegant, and usually finely chiseled. It will narrow at the muzzle, and the eyes will be expressive, kind, and large. The forehead is broad, giving the animal a look of intelligence and nobility. This horse\u2019s hooves will be solid and the legs should be muscular and feature clean, broad joints. When walking, the animal almost appears to float with the movement. The trot is full of impulsion and balanced. Overall, the Trakehner is deemed the most refined and lightest of all of the warmblood equine breeds. The Trakehner Horse is one of the oldest warmblood breeds from Germany. Trakehner horses have lovely coats in a wide range of colors. Some of the most common colors seen in this breed are roan, black, chestnut, gray, and bay. Some horses may be pinto colored as well. Grooming your Trakehner horse on a regular basis is important not only to keep the skin and coat clean and healthy, but also to bond with your equine companion. Set aside time to shampoo and condition your horse to keep the coat looking beautiful and to get rid of any dirt that regular brushing will not remove. Use a hoof pick to thoroughly clean out your horse\u2019s hooves, and make it a point to examine the hooves closely each time in order to check for any injuries or infections that may be developing. A tail brush and a mane comb can be used to keep this horse\u2019s hair free of tangles. And you can also use a curry comb, shedding blade, body finishing brush, and dandy brush to thoroughly remove dirt, debris, and excess hair from the coat to keep it smooth and shiny. Be gentle around delicate areas, such as the face, so that your horse can enjoy each grooming session.", "facts": " Athletic, large,  refined Experienced horse owners, trainers, and riders  Even-tempered, good natured, loyal, friendly, kind, energetic, intelligent, and eager to please", "tags": "arabian, east prussian horse, east prussian horse breed, thoroughbred, Trakehner, Trakehner Horse, Trakehner Horse breed, "}, "welsh pony": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/welsh-pony/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/welsh-pony.jpg", "name": "Welsh Pony", "type": "horse", "text": "For centuries, the Welsh Pony has been bred throughout the hills of Wales that are found in the western part of Great Britain. It is believed that these horses were there before the Romans, and there is also evidence that the Welsh Cob was in Wales before 1600 BC. The climate, along with the rough terrain, of the area greatly influenced the ponies\u2019 temperament and action. These are horses that have developed a strong constitution as a result of having to survive on sparse mosses and grasses in their environment. There are four categories of horses within the Welsh Pony breed. It was not until 1901 that the Welsh Pony and Cob Society was created in Wales. In 1902, the Welsh Pony and Cob Stud Book was established. At that point in time, the four fixed types of Welsh Pony were separated and described individually. Up to that point, Welsh ponies had been influenced by several different equine breeds. In fact, throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, these ponies were crossed with Hackneys, Thoroughbreds, and Arabians. In the 1880s, Welsh ponies were being imported to America, so the Welsh Pony and Cob Society of America was established in 1907 to serve as a breed registry. In the 1950s, interest in the breed grew, and it eventually became one of the fastest growing equine breeds in America. Because the Welsh Pony and Cob Stud Book has four sections, the different types of ponies within the Welsh Pony breed will have varying personality traits. Section A, the Welsh Mountain Pony, will have a high level of intelligence, as well as a temperament that makes these ponies ideal for children. These ponies will also make good harness horses. The Welsh Pony of Section B has all of the same wonderful attributes that are associated with the Welsh Mountain Pony. However, these are even better riding ponies, even for children. They have an outstanding temperament, combined with a natural talent for jumping. The Welsh Pony of Cob Type, or Section C, is sure-footed, hardy, and active. This is an ideal horse for both children and adults, as well as those who want to compete at higher levels or just ride for pleasure. These animals are versatile, natural jumpers, and they do well in harness as well. Finally, the Welsh Cob of Section D can be described as a wonderful riding horse that is renowned for its tractability, endurance, and courage. These horses are agile, hardy, and strong, and they also feature a lovely temperament that is ideal for all levels of riders. The Welsh Pony is a great choice for children. The Welsh Pony and Cob Stud Book has four sections: Section A features ponies that are referred to as Welsh Mountain Ponies. These are the smallest of the four Welsh Pony types, as they should not be taller than 12 hands high. They will feature elegant legs, good girth depth, and delicate heads. Section B features ponies that are referred to as the Welsh Pony of Riding Type. These should not be taller than 13.2 hands, and they should have excellent action, thanks to their sloping shoulders. Section C features ponies that are referred to as the Welsh Pony of Cob Type. These should not be taller than 13.2 hands either. Their body should compact and feature a deep girth, and the legs should be muscular and short. Section D features Welsh Cobs that are more than 13.2 hands high. The head will showcase the same delicate features that are found on all of the Welsh Pony types. However, these animals will also have strong hind legs and quarters that result in the outstanding Cob action. You can also note feathering at the heels. Welsh ponies are agile, hardy, and strong. The Welsh Pony can feature any of the many beautiful equine colors. Some of the most commonly seen colors include brown, grullo, palomino, chestnut, bay, gray, black, and dun. However, these horses can\u2019t showcase skewbald or piebald colors. Because of their small stature, Welsh ponies are easy to keep as pets, and they are also easy to groom. As is the case with all other equine breeds, regular grooming sessions will serve as a time to bond with your pony, and they will also ensure that your pet\u2019s skin and coat remain healthy, smooth, and clean. Use a set of standard equine grooming tools that includes a curry comb, body finishing brush, dandy brush, and shedding blade. Also have a hoof pick, mane comb, and tail brush on hand. These tools will allow you to clean and examine every part of your pony\u2019s body with ease. Removing excess hair, as well as any dirt and debris that has accumulated throughout the coat, will keep your pony looking beautiful, but also use grooming time as a chance to check for injuries and infections, especially within the hooves.", "facts": " Small, compact All levels of horse owners, trainers, and riders, including children Social, friendly, intelligent, trustworthy, and easy to work with ", "tags": "welsh and cob, welsh and cob pony, welsh cob, Welsh Mountain Pony, Welsh Pony, welsh pony breed, welsh pony of cob type, welsh pony of riding type, welsh pony types, "}, "westphalian horse": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/horse/westphalian-horse/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/westphalian-horse.jpg", "name": "Westphalian Horse", "type": "horse", "text": "The Westphalian Horse, which is also known as the Westfalen Horse, originated in Westphalia, which is the biggest state in Germany that is located within the North Rhine area of the western part of the country. This region is found between the Weser and the Rhine rivers, and wild horses roamed free throughout these marshlands, where farming was not possible, during Roman times. Today, there remains one group of semi-wild horses that still roams the area, and each year, young stallions are caught and auctioned off. The Westphalian Horse is a descendant of those wild horses. Breeding horses is a tradition that dates back hundreds of years in Westphalia, but this equine breed was not created until 1826. Throughout the years, Oldenburg, Anglo Norman, Thoroughbred, and Hanoverian blood was used to develop the Westphalian breed. Westphalians have a relaxed nature, making them easy to work with. Before the invention of the tractor, the Westphalian Horse was used as a farm horse, as these animals were strong enough to pull carts to town, carry riders, and plow fields. However, these days, the breed is used in more versatile ways. Not only can these horses pull carriages, but they can also be used in equine eventing, dressage, and jumping. In 1999, the Westfalen Horse Association was created by dedicated enthusiasts of this unique equine breed. Their focus was to promote and support the Westphalian throughout the United States. The organization is an affiliate of the breed\u2019s German Association, which is in charge of handling breed registrations and records. Westphalian horses are hugely popular because they have a relaxed nature, so they are known for being composed and easy to work with. They are easy to ride and easy to train as well, and you can work with this breed whether you are a beginner or a professional rider or trainer. However, because these horses are big movers, they might not be suited to casual riders. These horses do, however, perform extremely well in dressage and show jumping. These athletic, attractive, and strong horses are also known for their work ethic, so they will be dedicated and willing to work with you, all while remaining even-tempered and cooperative. Overall, they are a pleasure to work with and be around. The Westphalian is similar in appearance to the Hanoverian. The Westphalian Horse is similar in its physical appearance to the Hanoverian Horse. Its attractive head features either a slightly dished or a straight profile. The neck should be long, and the chest should be deep. This horse will also feature powerful loins, sloping shoulders, a medium length back that is broad and straight, and strong hindquarters with a tail that is set high. Even though the legs are short and the joints are large and pronounced, they are also muscular, and you will notice that the forearms, in particular, have strong muscles. The hooves are well shaped and hard as well. This breed will have great suspension, and will even appear elegant as it moves, thanks to its muscular quarters and powerful body. It also features a lighter build when compared to other warmblood equine breeds, which contributes to its freedom of movement. Because the Westphalian Horse is not considered a specialist in any single type of equine sport, it can be hard to pinpoint the specific conformation for these horses. In fact, one horse could look different from the next. Westphalians will have great suspension and appear elegant as they move. You can find beautiful Westphalian horses featuring all of the solid equine colors. However, the most common coat colors for the Westphalian Horse are black, gray, chestnut, and bay. As with all other equine breeds, the Westphalian Horse greatly benefits from a consistent grooming routine. Use your grooming sessions to bond with your horse, as well as to massage and clean the skin and coat to keep your equine companion healthy and clean. In addition to using equine shampoo to thoroughly cleanse your horse whenever necessary, a standard equine grooming kit will ensure that you can detangle the tail and mane and smooth out the entire coat. After brushing your horse\u2019s entire body with a curry comb, you can use a dandy brush and shedding blade, if necessary, to remove additional debris, dirt, mud, and loose hair. You can focus on sensitive areas, such as the horse\u2019s legs and face, with a body finishing brush and damp rag, and then follow those tools up with a mane comb and tail brush to detangle the long, flowing hairs on those areas of the body. Finally, use a hoof pick to thoroughly clean the hooves of any debris, dirt, and rocks, and be sure to inspect the hooves closely to ensure that they are healthy as well.", "facts": " Powerful, light build All levels of horse owners, trainers, and riders Willing, even-tempered, easy to train, relaxed, strong work ethic", "tags": "german horse, german horse breed, Hanoverian, oldenburg, thoroughbred, westfalen horse, westphalian, westphalian horse, "}}
