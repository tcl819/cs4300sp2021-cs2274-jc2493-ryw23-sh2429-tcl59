Once you see an Australian King Parrot, it will be difficult to resist their beauty. Such colors are rarely seen. In the wild, these parrots have a very rich diet that is made up from various fruits, berries, nuts, flowers, seeds, insects and buds. To recreate this diet and offer your Australian King Parrot a balanced intake of proteins and nutrients, you should start with a small seed mix which contains the important canary, oats, safflower and hemp seeds. You should also include fruits such as apples, pears, bananas, and oranges, as well as some common nuts. A well-balanced diet will promote good health. Thanks to their large size, these parrots are quite hardy and rarely get sick. One of the biggest needs Australian King Parrot has as a pet is space. Their overall size and broad, big tails will require a large and spacious cage or even better \u2013 an aviary. You should also offer several hours of free flight per day \u2013 outside of the cage and around the home. Their average lifespan is around 25 years, so with plenty of good care, you can count on your friend being with you for a long time.

They stand out with some of their peculiar details but share many similarities with their close cousins as well. With their silly personality and an affectionate, loving side, they have quickly become one of the most popular pet parrots in Australia and the rest of the world as well. But, as it\u2019s often said, cockatoos, in general, might not be the pet for everyone. So let\u2019s get to know the little corellas and what makes them so popular! Bare Eyed Cockatoos stand out with their peculiar looks and distinct traits and are loved worldwide. Little corellas are some of the most common and widespread parrots in Australia as their native habitat stretches over most of the continent. They are also found in New Guinea. These birds prefer to live in the coastal plains, the arid and dry central Australian deserts, and urban areas as well. Little corellas adapted to live in urban areas and are now a common sight in Sydney, Brisbane, and Canberra. Throughout the history, these cockatoos have been a part of the Aboriginal culture. These tribes would keep them as pets, as well as hunt them for food and headgear decoration. Although considered one of the smaller cockatoo breeds, the Bare Eyed Cockatoo is medium to large-sized when compared to other parrots. The adults reach an average length of 14 to 16 inches (35 to 40 centimeters) and can weigh up to 1 pound (500 grams). They also have an impressive wingspan, too, so ensure a roomy cage and plenty of free space. These cockatoos are zygodactyls \u2013 they have a distinct ability to use their feet as a helping tool when climbing, eating and hanging upside down. When it comes to sounds and noise level, there\u2019s one thing you need to remember about all cockatoos \u2013 they can be very loud. While this is absolutely true for large cockatoos, the little corellas are slightly less talkative in comparison. They have a good ability to memorize in repeat common words, and mostly in a clear, well-defined voice. But still, there is the tendency to mimic human speech in their loud, slurred and incredibly silly manner, which can go on for a while and cause some tension. Bare Eyed Cockatoo might not be the best apartment bird. Bare eyed cockatoos are entirely white. While this goes for many common cockatoo breeds, a few details are certainly unique. And that\u2019s the trait that gives them their name \u2013 a patch of featherless light blue skin around the eyes and the upper cheek, with slight pink coloration close to the beak. They also have their popular crest, which is used to signify their mood and alertness.  Don\u2019t confuse the simplicity of their appearance for plainness \u2013 these are graceful birds with a beautiful plumage. The bare patch around the eyes is the defining detail of the Bare Eyed Cockatoo.  The rest is shared with their close cousins. In the wild, little corellas are mostly ground feeders but sometimes eat in the trees and shrubbery. They like seeds, insects, fruits, and nectar. They also intrude on agricultural crops where they eat wheat, corn, and barley. As a pet, they will love a seed based mixed designed for cockatoos. But still, you\u2019ll need to balance this diet with a regular addition of fresh fruits and vegetables. Apples, bananas, oranges, cabbage, kale, and carrots are some of their favorite treats. Bare Eyed Cockatoo is really good at adapting to most conditions, thanks to its harsh native habitat and a strong, robust build. They have a long lifespan \u2013 up to 60 years \u2013 and will rarely get sick if given enough attention and good care. Some common symptoms of sickness are feather plucking, apathy, difficulty breathing and loss of appetite. One thing they absolutely love is bathing. Bathing dishes and shower time should be a regular treat, as it helps maintain a good health base. Showers are a treat for little corellas. They are refreshing, cool them down, and keep skin diseases at bay. Bare Eyed Cockatoo parrots are very intelligent and highly energetic birds. Getting one as your pet demands a lifelong commitment and a lot of care. They love to hang upside down, to nibble on things and generally exercise their strong beaks. Their mood can also revolve around two patterns: it\u2019s either all fun, games and noisy silliness or quiet and cuddly affectionate time. Just keep in mind \u2013 with a bit of patience and dedicated care, a cockatoo can and will become a loving friend for a long, long time.", "facts": " Cockatoo White Vocal, Noisy, Talkative, Mimics, Natural calls Social, Playful, Fun, Affectionate, Energetic", "tags": "bare-eyed cockatoo, blood-stained cockatoo, Blue Eyed Cockatoo, companion pet birds, little cockatoo, little corella, long-lived pet birds, pet birds for families, pet birds for house, short-billed corella, "}, "black capped conure": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/bird/black-capped-conure/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/black-capped-conure.jpg", "name": "Black Capped Conure", "type": "bird", "text": "With their unique looks, vibrant patterns and a friendly, silly personality, the Black Capped Conure has found its way into the hearts of many owners. With a friendly, docile and often goofy temperament, these little birds boast a lot of traits that make them perfect pet parrots. They are easy to take care of and can be a perfect choice for beginner owners. Additionally, these little parrots are considered as one of the quieter conure breeds. Owners who live in apartments can rest easy \u2013 the Black Capped Conure is a quieter bird with well-rounded traits.   Black Capped Conures is one of the most unique-looking breeds of this family. As a bonus, they are very friendly and entertaining. These are one of the iconic birds of the southern Amazon River basin. Their habitat also covers the Andean slopes and spans a region that includes parts of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. They thrive in the humid forests of the region, and can also be found in the Amazon lowlands, but also on the slopes of the Andes, where flocks can be seen even at altitudes of up to 2000 meters. Sadly, this breed is near threatened, due to the increasing displacement and destruction of their pristine habitat. In the wild, these parrots will sometimes interbreed with Green Cheeked Conures, producing mixed, hybrid parrots.  Even though they are largely similar to other closely related conures in physical appearance, the rock conures, as they\u2019re also known as, are one of the smallest in the species. Black Capped Conure flaunts a host of unique and distinguishing features, making them easy to recognize. The adults reach an average length of 10 inches (25 centimeters) and can weigh around 2.5 ounces (70 grams). They have moderately sized tail feathers and can be generally considered as medium-sized parrots. Conures are very energetic and will require a plenty of space. They like to hop about and \u201ctransform\u201d household items into their new toys. To prevent boredom and depression, you need to ensure a spacious cage and a lot of time out of it.  Conures can sometimes be loud and expressive with their natural calls and goofy mimics. But, before apartment dwellers get disappointed, you should have in mind that the Black Capped Conure is among the quieter breeds of the species. They still possess their jolly natural calls, but they are moderate and easy to tolerate and occur most often at sunrise and sundown. Conures are not the best talking parrots, so don\u2019t expect much when it comes to your new pet\u2019s vocabulary. Conures are not always colored in an exotic fashion, but Black Capped Conure has a lot of intricate details that give them their own, special charm. The body is mostly colored in a deep green. The cheek area is brownish green, while the top of the head and the nape are black, giving them their name. One of the unique details is on the collar and upper chest \u2013 an intricate pattern of black and white feathers that resemble scales. Wing edges are bright red, and the lower tail is black. Add a black beak and feet into the mix, and you get a truly charming little parrot with a lot of details that stand out.  Their intricately patterned chest feathers are a detail unique to a Black Capped Conure. To easily begin a balanced and full diet, you should start first with a seed-based mix designed for conures. It contains and replicates all the nutrients of their diet in the wilderness. It is mostly full of millet, oats, nuts and sunflower seeds. The next step is a regular intake of vitamins through fresh fruits and vegetables. Occasionally, cooked foods like rice or chicken breast can also serve as a good source of protein. Since conures really like to chew and exercise their strong beaks, a cuttlebone is a recommended addition to their cage.   Although their modest size doesn\u2019t give off that impression, these parrots have little issues with their health. Sometimes, their entire lifespan of 30 years can pass without any health issues at all. Of course, you should make sure to meet all of your pet\u2019s needs. One of the things to remember is to provide enough mental stimulation and social interaction. A bored Black Capped Conure can become lonely and, in turn, begin to pluck his own feathers. If not taken care of on time, this problem can grow out of proportions. These intelligent and friendly parrots will require your friendship. Provide a lot of social interaction to avoid a lonely and neglected bird. One of the friendlier breeds, these conures are a perfect playful pal and are full of positive energy. They are noted for bonding with their family and showing a timid and docile side when guests are in the house. One of the reasons behind their popularity is their clownish personality \u2013 they love to play, invent new tricks and hop around the house in a truly silly fashion.

They might require a little bit more patience than some of the more common pet parrots, but with a little bit of getting used to, you will quickly get attached to your rare and colorful pet. You can expect to get a loyal and affectionate companion in return for your care and effort.  One of New Guinea\u2019s most colorful species, the plumage of the Black Capped Lory is definitely one of a kind. These interesting birds originate from New Guinea.

They are most often seen in small flocks of 10 birds and are always near fresh water sources and food in the rainforest. During their breeding season, the individual pairs separate from the group to nest and raise their young. Most lories share a lot of physical similarities, but they are all different and unique when it comes to the colorations. You can easily spot a lory by their stocky build, prominent chest and nape, unique curved beak and the iconic black stripe around the eyes.

Belly (and chest in some subspecies) is dark blue, getting lighter and eventually becoming very light, bright blue on the thighs and underneath the tail. The wings are green, while the nape and back are dark, purplish blue. This extraordinary combination of colors definitely leaves a long-lasting impression. New Guinea is a place full of wonders and unique species. The strikingly colorful plumage of the Black Capped Lory is proof enough.

You should also add a regular dose of fresh fruits and green vegetables. Keep in mind that Black Capped lories like to chew on things and sharpen their powerful beaks. For this, you can get a cuttlebone or a natural, parrot-safe branch that will serve as both a perch and a chewing toy. These robust and stocky parrots are strong and endure most common conditions with ease. Provided you prevent basic threats like too high or too low temperatures, drafty and damp places, but also neglect in the form of lack of social interaction, you will experience little to no troubles with your pet\u2019s health.

Black Headed Caiques are the definition of parrots \u2013 colorful, smart and inquisitive. These feathered explorers are a ton of fun! With a natural preference for humid, tropical rainforest in the Amazon region of northern South America, their native habitat includes a vast area that spans countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and others. There, they inhabit the treetops of Amazonian forests, with 10 to 30 birds in one noisy, colorful flock. Their favorite food in the wild is comprised of insects, flowers, and seeds. Black Headed Caiques are medium-sized parrots, but smaller than most birds in this family. Adults can grow up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) in length, with a stubby, robust look due to their short tail feathers. Males are identical to females, which is why positive identification can be a difficult task. The ruffled, puffy looking, white chest and belly feathers are a unique trait of these caiques, giving them a good dose of fluffiness and a slightly comical appearance. Your pet caique will surprise you with its inquisitive nature and a talent for mimicking sounds. Most of all, they love to show off what they learn. Alarms, sirens, beeps and animal sounds are the most common, and occasionally only a few words can be heard. They will often combine these sounds, creating new ones or making different sound patterns. Since Black Headed Caiques can be a bit noisy at times, consider covering their cage with a light cloth at night, nudging them to sleep and be silent. Distinguishing patterns and color markings are a telltale sign of Black Headed Caiques. Firstly, they owe their names to the dark black crown, or the top of their head, while its lower part is yellow. Their back and wings are green, and their thighs are yellow. The puffy chests and bellies are pure white. This unique combination of vivid colors is certainly a lovely sight, bringing a breath of their tropical homeland right into your home.

With added green vegetables and selected fruits like apples and oranges, they will get all the essential nutrients and vitamins that ensure your bird stays healthy. Caiques love to move about. They will require a large, spacious cage with a lot of swings and perches, since they like to hop all over the place. Some toys are good too, as these birds have a habit of nipping and biting at everything- you included! They have a long lifespan that can reach up from 25 to 40 years, and this makes them a good choice for a long-term, companion pet. The Black Headed Caique has a hardy and vigorous nature and need only basic care to be a perfectly healthy pet. Avoid drafty, dark and cold places, and make good hygiene a priority. They like to bathe and will make a mess of their drinking water if not provided with a bathing dish. Since their tendency to bite and be grumpy when bored, avoid placing them together with birds of different species. Violence can ensue. These birds are quite energetic and will require a lot of space and toys to satisfy their inquisitive needs. Fun is the best adjective to describe caiques. Their questioning, exploring minds will lead them to every nook and corner if they\u2019re allowed to roam freely. They\u2019ll enjoy playing, socializing and petting and scratches \u2013 but overstep your boundaries, and you\u2019ll earn yourself a nibble or two!

Their crown is what gives them their name and separates them from the Plum Headed Parakeet. Of course, the iconic black ring around the neck is present. The females are slightly different, their head being pale bluish grey and no ring present. These parrots are closely related to the Alexandrine Parakeets \u2013 perhaps the most popular of all pet parrot breeds. A pet parrot will need a well-balanced diet in order to thrive.

Even though they are endangered and rare in the wild, they are a sought-after breed in the world of pet birds, as they display a variety of interesting traits. Peaceful and friendly, but inquisitive as well, these parrots have all that is needed for a loving and charming pet. One of the iconic parrots of the Philippines, they are a common pet in this Pacific country, but a rare treat for pet owners in the rest of the world. Let\u2019s try to learn more about the unique Blue Headed Racket Tail!  Charming and pretty, the Blue Headed Racket Tail parrot makes a great pet for families or singles. The natural habitat for these parrots is found in Southeast Asia, mostly centered around the Philippines. This region includes islands such as Palawan, Balabac, Dumaran, and others.     They inhabit the regional lowland forests, mangroves, and sparse growths. Sadly, these parrots are a vulnerable breed, suffering greatly due to forest clearing and illegal capture. It is estimated that only between 7000 and 10000 birds remain in the wild. Several programs have been started in hopes of preserving the breed. The family of racquet tail parrots is relatively small, and most of the birds share some crucial similarities. However, Blue Headed Racket Tail is unique in its own way and are easily recognized by their appearance. The adults reach an average length of 11 inches (28 centimeters) and have a balanced, slender physique. Their neck is slightly elongated. One of the most interesting aspects and the detail that gives them their name is the so-called \u201cracket tail\u201d. A pair of long, bare feather shafts protrudes out from their tail and is topped off with two small circular \u201cspatulas\u201d. This is a feature unique only for this species, and can\u2019t be seen anywhere else in the parrot world. As is the case with many exotic breeds, the Blue Headed Racket Tail tends to be vocal and loud. This makes them unsuitable as an apartment pet. Even though they are not talkative as some pet parrots, their natural calls can be loud and raucous. This is often a series of short squawks and sometimes a melodious short song. Some birds can learn to mimic just a few words in a very cute way, but this often requires training and patience. Blue Headed Racket Tail is very receptive to music, to which they will dance and sing along with their melodic squawks. The Blue Headed Racket Tail is an elegant and graceful bird. Even if they don\u2019t show a lot of flashy colors, their peculiar details and color combinations make them extremely charming and beautiful. They are almost entirely green, with visibly lighter tones on the lower side of the body. The wings and back are darker, and their unique tails show a yellow lower part, tipped off with bright, sky blue. As the name suggests, the top half of their head has prominent light blue tones. The tips of the flight feathers are dark blue. This lovely look, combined with their unique \u201cracket\u201d tail extensions, makes for an exotic parrot that will leave no one indifferent.  The \u201cracket tail\u201d is an unusual and beautiful feature, exclusive to these pacific parrots and just a few other birds. Their wild diet is sparsely documented, but the experts all agree on two main foods \u2013 fruits and nuts. As a pet, the Blue Headed Racket Tail will thrive on a fruit-based diet. Fresh bananas, oranges, apples, and pears are all a good choice. Some pellet-based mixes for exotic parrots can also work well as a supplement to their diet. Blue Headed Racket Tail will also enjoy bathing, so don\u2019t forget to offer bathing dishes regularly.

Quickly captivating the attention of their discoverers, these colorful parrots became a desired pet and companion. They were first mentioned and detailed in 1805, by an English zoologist George Shaw, while some thirty five years later, the Budgerigar Parakeet was finally properly named by John Gould, an ornithologist and bird lover of great reputation. Budgerigars are one of Australia\u2019s most vibrant and lively national symbols. These parakeets thrived for millions of years in their harsh natural home in Australia\u2019s dry regions, where they are still a common sight- and a borderline national symbol. The arid and hot landscape of its habitat is an all too obvious reason for the hardiness this bird possesses and its inherent ability to adapt and thrive in different conditions. In fact, its adaptability may be the main reason why the Budgerigar Parakeet became one of the most widespread and common pets we know today. All Budgerigar Parakeets are known for their unique and wildly colorful appearance and amiable personalities. They usually grow around 7-8 inches (~18 cm) in overall length and can live to be up to 10 years old in ideal conditions. The weight of these petite birds doesn\u2019t exceed more than 40 grams! But don\u2019t let their size fool you: Budgerigar Parakeets are well known for their ability to persevere and thrive in many global climates. Like many different parrot species, the budgerigars are champions when it comes to talking and mimicry of human voices and everyday sounds. Both sexes, males especially, can develop an abundant vocabulary of words they memorize and mimic. This behavior is often best observed in solitary male Budgerigar Parakeets that are most talkative. Budgerigars are also great singing birds, developing a lovely song of smooth melodies, woven with adorable whistles. The vivid and lively coloration of the feathers with distinguishing patterns is one of the prominent features of a Budgerigar. The varied palette of their plumage is what made them stand out among the spectacular specimens of Australian wildlife: it can go up to a 100 different shades and color combinations, but most of the common ones remain the green, yellow, blue, white and gray, or their various hues. Budgies can be divided into two groups: white-based (blue being the most common) and yellow-based (popular green Budgerigars). The other prominent aspect is the intricate pattern adorning their nape, back, and wings, displayed through mixed black lines and dotted designs, adding to their overall unique appearance. These small parakeets boast vibrant and unique color variations of feathers. As these parrots are highly common, so is their food, which is also varied and comes in many different versions. Most common are the mixtures of bird seed that are readily available and will make a fine staple diet for your Budgie. The quality of these mixes can vary, so choose the best you can. As a supplement to their diet, an excellent choice would be an occasional piece of fresh fruit or veggie, as well as mineral blocks to increase iodine and vitamins intake and give your parrot a chance to take care of its beak. If you take proper care of your Budgerigar Parakeet, they shouldn\u2019t have any serious health issues or behavioral problems. Some of the common conditions that might occur in these birds are the splay leg that can happen during earliest development, as well as feather picking, which is a direct result of loneliness and lack of attention. As long as you do your best to provide optimal benefits, roomy cage and company, paired with staple diet \u2013 your budgerigar will live a long and happy life. Budgies require a minimal amount of care, as they are strong and healthy birds. Budgerigar Parakeets are highly social birds.

One of Africa\u2019s prettiest avians, this rare bird is an all-around great family pet \u2013 if you can get one, that is. Their threatened status, protection against illegal trade and a very small habitat, all make them one of the rarest pet parrots in the world. Only around a hundred birds are held as pets.  Cape parrots are rare in captivity, but make great pets. Acquiring one is certainly worth the wait and the effort. These parrots occupy some of the smallest regions in Africa, compared to any other parrot species. They are endemic only to South Africa and live in the popular Afromontane forests and woodlands near the South African coastline. These moderate altitude forests are largely full of Yellowwood trees and occur at heights of around 1000 meters above sea level. They are a vulnerable species and are declining rapidly. Stricter laws and various volunteer actions are helping preserve Cape parrots and maintain steady populations despite heavy logging and loss of habitat. This robust, well-defined parrot is fairly large and has a muscular build. With their short tails and rounded wings, they share some similarities with African Grey parrots. The adults are 13 inches (34 centimeters) long on average, with quite a weight of  10 to 14 ounces (300 to 400 grams). One of the defining features of Cape parrots is the very large and powerful, sharply curved beak, which they use for cracking various nuts in the wild. Females have a single feature that sets them apart from males \u2013 a single orange patch on the forehead.  Like a lot of parrots originating in Africa, the Cape parrot is also great talkers. Some even compared their ability with those of the African Greys, which says a lot. Besides the great talking ability, they do have some loud natural calls.

This makes them suitable for apartment settings, but due to their large size and wingspan, they will still need a lot of space.  With a combination of a powerful, noble build and a colorful plumage, the Cape parrot certainly captivates with its general appearance. The dominant color is green, and it covers the belly, thighs and center wings. The head, nape, and chest are gray with brown speckles all over. The upper wings are black with the very front edge being bright orange. The flight feathers are gray.  Other cute details are the two orange bands on their ankles \u2013 like little socks. With this wonderful combination of colors, the little details and their large cream colored beaks, the Cape parrots are definitely pretty birds! Full of well placed, tiny details, the unique Cape parrots are a rare and beautiful sight. In the wild they evolved to feed on a variety of tree blossoms, fruits, and nuts, utilizing their disproportionately large beaks to crack open all those exotic foods. In captivity, they need a balanced diet which is best compared to that of the African Grey. Specialized seed mixes, fresh fruits, and veggies, as well as cooked rice and chicken,  should be the staple of the diet. A cuttlebone is a good choice for birds with large and powerful beaks. It is a natural way to blunt the ends, and certainly a better option than your furniture.  You can be sure that the health of these parrots is just like their physique \u2013 strong and sturdy. These healthy birds reach their lifespan of up to 60 years without much trouble, and they have the lowest chances of skin and feather diseases.

With a similar personality to one of its close cousins, the Dusky Lory, it is without a doubt a wonderful pet with both a lovely personality and an incredible beauty. These crimson charmers are often hard to come by, but when you finally do, you are guaranteed a one of a kind feathered friend.  With its unique, exotic and beautiful plumage, the Cardinal Lory is one of the prettiest pet parrots around.

They are found on Solomon and Bougainville islands, as well as the Bismarck Archipelago. These parrots thrive in regional humid forests, mangroves, coconut plantations, and coastal woodlands, where they feed and nest in tree canopies. Cardinal Lory parrots often travel between many of the tiny coral islands that surround their habitat. As they do this, they cover great distances and establish small populations where they weren\u2019t before.  Most, if not all of the physical aspects are shared with the closely related Dusky Lory. The slender body and the prominent, unique beak are all quite similar. The adults reach an average length of 12 inches (31 centimeters) and can weigh around 7 ounces (215 grams). These slim and energetic birds will require a plenty of free space. Males and females are completely identical, and identifying them might be a challenge. While the Cardinal Lory might not be the quietest parrot around, it\u2019s not too noisy either. Their only downside is their natural calls that are often piercing and harsh. But they aren\u2019t heard often \u2013 mostly when your pet is neglected or bored. Other than that, these parrots will quietly chitter chatter and chirp to themselves, and will not become great talkers or particularly skilled mimics. All these facts combined might not make these pets well suited for an apartment setting. Cardinal Lory is the proof that exotic combinations and numerous patterns are not always the prettiest. Sometimes the simplest and straightforward looks can be the most breathtaking one. These birds are entirely a deep vermilion. Wings and back are slightly darker, while the chest has lighter streaks, giving them a unique aspect. With the added contrast from the black area around the beak and the black feet, this look is complete. This unique color proves to be a charming look for these exotic Oceanic parrots. Being entirely red, these parrots possess a unique and graceful elegance that stands apart in the parrot world. In the wild, these parrots thrive on a diet of seeds, flowers, fruits, and insects, but are chiefly a nectar-feeding breed. A commercial or homemade nectar should be the basis of their diet as a pet and enriched with a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Cardinal Lory is one of those parrot breeds that really enjoy bathing and moisture, so you should provide regular bathing dishes, and water sprays as a reward or a quick \u201cshower\u201d. This will also ensure a spot on hygiene and minimize the threat of feather-borne disease. Lories are hardy parrots, with a great ability to adapt to any conditions. You\u2019ll need to provide a lot of room and a balanced diet in order to keep them healthy. Cardinal Lory is smart, energetic and friendly \u2013 this means they will need your company and social interaction in order to feel happy and comfortable. This is a big part of a pet parrot\u2019s well being. So do all you can to keep your pet mentally stimulated and eliminate any possibility of neglect. Friendly and sociable parrots such as Cardinal Lory will require a lot of your attention and stimulation in order to thrive and feel happy and loved. Cardinal Lory has a great balance of desirable traits, making them great as pet parrots. They are smart and energetic, bringing a lot of fun into the household with their love for tricks and entertainment. Additionally, these birds can sometimes be really affectionate and open to handling and cuddling. They do have a bit of an \u201cattitude\u201d, as they\u2019re quite forward and never shy.

These South American parrots inhabit a wide region that is centered around Ecuador, Southwestern Colombia and Peru. Celestial Parrotlet thrives on the Pacific slopes of the Andes, coastal mangroves, scrubland and banana, and mango plantations as well. Parrotlets are one of the cavity-nesting species, as they prefer to lay their eggs in tree holes, cactuses or abandoned nests.  Almost all Parrotlet breeds are similar in their appearance, often differing only in their colors. They have a few distinct physical aspects, which combined with their small size, makes them easy to recognize. The adults reach an average length of just 5 inches (12 centimeters) and will weigh a mere ounce (30 grams). While they won\u2019t take up a lot of space and will require only a moderate cage, Celestial Parrotlet is still full of energy. A time out of the cage is a must, but so is your attention. These tiny mischievous goofs will love to hide, explore and get into all kinds of trouble. Keep an eye out! An advantage of small parrot breeds is the smaller they are \u2013 the quieter they get. The Celestial Parrotlet is a great apartment pet. They have a variety of natural calls, but almost all of them are melodious chirps and miniature shrieks. None of these are significantly loud and are easily overlooked. But they are not a talking breed. Don\u2019t count on any mimics or words from your pet \u2013 they are simply too small for any of that.  Parrotlets are amongst the simplest species when it comes to colors. While they are undoubtedly the biggest charmers, don\u2019t expect any flashy combinations or exotic patterns. The body has a lot of light, wispy colors. The chest and abdomen are light grayish green, with much darker shades on the wings. Their face is a pastel green, with the unique light violet color on the back of the head.

But whatever your choice \u2013 you\u2019ll end up with a charming little bird. With major differences in coloration, the males and females are easily recognized. In the wild, these parrots feed on a variety of grass seeds, berries, fruits, and agricultural crops. They are often targeted as pests \u2013 as they have a tendency to invade gardens and plantations in more populated areas. A balanced diet for your Celestial Parrotlet should be started with a commercial seed mix with a good amount of millet, canary seeds, oats, and buckwheat. Safflower, hemp and similar seeds can work as well.  The second part of a balanced diet is in the vitamins. These are found in fresh greenery such as cabbage, lettuce, dandelions, and chard. Put in some apples, oranges, and pears for good measure, and you\u2019ll have a perfectly balanced diet for your pet. Remember that, because of the tiny size of the Celestial Parrotlet, all foods should be chopped to a fine, almost mushy consistency.  It is easy to make a mistake with these small and cute looking parrots, and think that their health is fragile. But that is far from the truth. With plenty of good care and attention, and with a balanced diet, a Celestial Parrotlet will live up to 25 years without many troubles along the way. With optimized conditions and enough interaction, you will realize that parrotlets are in fact quite easy to take care of. The main threat is their small size. Always be on guard when they are out and about, to prevent any accidents like squishing them. Celestial Parrotlet can be really mischievous and inquisitive.

They are vibrant and full of positive energy which is manifested through silly tricks and a bit of cuddliness as well.

Their fun and energetic, often goofy behavior, and affectionate tendencies will quickly charm you and in no time you will fall in love with your colorful feathered friend. And with a lifespan of up to 30 or more years, you can find a companion for a long time. Chattering Lory is best known for its striking colors \u2013 they make for a unique appearance. The home of these parrots is reserved to the North Maluku in Indonesia. This province consists of a few islands in the Maluku archipelago. This relatively small natural habitat and the excessive trapping for illegal trade have resulted in significant losses and declining populations. That\u2019s why today, the Chattering Lory is considered to be a vulnerable breed. Indonesian officials are fighting to preserve their habitat and stabilize their populations. They are usually found in local montane forests at altitudes of up to 1050 meters, and they live in canopies.  When it comes to the physical aspect, at a first glance the Chattering Lory is largely similar to their close cousins in the Lory family of parrots. The short conical tail, the small beak, and the distinct eyes are all there and shared among the species. Even so, they have a few distinct unique traits, the color being the major one.  The adults reach an average length of 12 inches (30 centimeters) and weigh up to \u00bd pound (250 grams). They are considered to be medium-sized parrots, and as such, they will need to have a plenty of room and exercise during the day. Additionally, with being a highly social and energetic parrot, they will surely need all the space and fun activities you can provide. While Chattering Lory is not terribly noisy, they do have one small drawback \u2013 their natural calls. They have a piercing and high pitched call which can be heard a few times per day. This aspect makes the lories best suited for house environments or outdoor aviaries. On the other hand, all lories are fantastic mimics. They have a natural knack for impersonation and will surprise you with their accuracy. Whistles, telephones, alarms and common animals are among the favorite sounds to repeat.  One common aspect shared by all lories is their magnificent, striking and, without a doubt, charming plumage.

For the most part, wings are a tropical green, lighter on top and getting dark towards the bottom. The wing tips are black. The lower half of the front tail feathers is black, while underneath the tail there\u2019s a fiery mixture of red, yellow and orange, displaying a magnificent detail when the bird is perched. The thighs and legs are also bright green. One of the distinct details is the orange beak and the thin, black strip across the eyes, giving their face a mysterious look.

To achieve a balanced diet for your lory, you should add a regular dose of fresh fruits and vegetables. Just remember to avoid chocolate, sugary sweets, and avocado. These can cause diarrhea, and sometimes even bigger issues. Chattering lories are known for being hardy and having good health overall. That is, of course, if you take good care of them. Being highly intelligent and very social birds, they might require more interaction than some other breeds. Be sure to play often and provide a lot of toys to keep them occupied and content.

They prefer the regional tropical forests, sparse woodlands and also the agricultural properties. Sadly, the Citron Crested cockatoos are a critically endangered breed in the wild. Their numbers are as low as ~600 birds in total. This is a result of prolonged deforestation, habitat loss, and illegal trapping. Still, these parrots endure in the aviculture, thanks to the efforts of bird lovers across the world.

Luckily, the Citron Crested Cockatoo is well known as the quieter of the bunch. This comes as a relief for those who would prefer their pet bird to be less loud.

They are also great mimics and can learn to repeat words to some extent, but the result is often a flood of silly words.  The first thing you realize about most Cockatoo breeds is their lack of exotic colors. For the most part, they are simple, single color birds, but with a big dose of elegance and a peculiar charm.

Their hilarious antics, intelligence, and an outgoing character make them loved all across the world. Cockatiels are amongst the most loved parrots and are one of the most popular pet parrot breeds around. And here are the most important things you need to know about these adorable avians. Cockatiels are fun and friendly- a perfect bird for children and beginner pet owners. Like many of their cousins, Cockatiels originated in the Australian continent, thriving in the arid scrubland of that nation\u2019s hinterland. Coming from those harsh conditions, cockatiels adapted perfectly to the milder climates all over the world, quickly becoming the perfect image of a hardy and healthy pet, requiring very little in order to be happy and strong. In the wild, they can be spotted roosting en-masse in large tree canopies, where their raucous singing creates a proper chaotic symphony of parrot lingo. These parrot flocks are often found near water sources, and can number several hundred at any given time. Sadly, wild cockatiels can be considered as pests \u2013 these huge flocks can often decimate crops and cause great damage for the farmers. They are found over most of the Australian continent, with the exception of the most arid deserts towards the south.  Cockatiels have a very showy appearance and are treasured for it. One of their distinctive markings is their crest. Many of its different positions will signify your pet\u2019s current mood. When your cockatiel is angry or scared, their crest will be flat, and when they\u2019re excited, it becomes pointy and vertical. They grow in length to about 13 inches, and their long tail feathers make for a good part of their size. With proper care, healthy diet and exercise, these birds can reach a lifespan of up to 25 years. Another distinct feature of a basic, natural cockatiel appearance is their coloration and the various little details on their plumage.  Also, cockatiels are not very large \u2013 a fact that might be attractive to owners with little free space around the house. At 30 to 33 cm (12 to 13 inches), the cockatiel is the smallest of all the cockatoos \u2013 but has plenty of spirit to boot. In the wild, cockatiels display a pronounced sexual dimorphism \u2013 meaning that the males and females tend to look totally different, mainly in the coloration.  These cockatoos love to express themselves vocally! With plenty of room and natural light, they\u2019ll soon liven your house up with their familiar and subtle melody. Don\u2019t hesitate to put on some music or whistle melodies yourself if you want to expand their repertoire. They\u2019re very inquisitive and will soon pick up simple tones and voices to repeat. You should try teaching them, as they are sure to love the interaction. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to realize that your little cockatiel is a true music aficionado! They can memorize moderately complex melodies and tunes and repeat them in a melodious style at their leisure. In a musical home, a cockatiel will feel thrilled \u2013 their natural desire to sing will be all the more accentuated! Cockatiels are known for their coloring, which is one of the many small details that make them unique.Cockatiels are usually grey on their body, with white wing feathers to complete that balanced and dashing look. Of course, cockatiel breeders managed to create a string of unique color combinations in captive birds. Today there is an almost endless choice of colors, with pure yellow, platinum, pied, lutino, and white being the most popular. Still, you can\u2019t beat the charm of a cockatiel\u2019s natural colors. You can easily spot which bird is the male and which the female, as males have a yellow head. Another unique and cute mark of cockatiels are the red circles on their cheeks \u2013 as if they are blushing!

You should provide a source of fresh water each day where they can stay hydrated and take a bath. Cockatiels will absolutely love it! Ruffling their feathers in water and taking little goofy baths is a delight for these parrots. It is also one of their daily activities in the wild, so consider it a natural need. Of course, this water will have to be replaced very often. When diet is considered, most of their food needs will be taken care of by the usual Cockatiel seed mix found in pet stores. It is balanced and provides all the essential nutrients your pet bird needs. You can also include additional vitamins and proteins in their diet with an occasional piece of apple, banana, or carrot. And don\u2019t forget to surprise them with a cuttlebone, which will help them sharpen their beak and replenish their intake of calcium. Don\u2019t be fooled by their diminutive stature and a small beak \u2013 they can be quite strong and that beak will need the exercise.  As it is the case with all pet birds, Cockatiels need a spacious cage to call their home, preferably one with sidebars, as these birds love to climb. The cage should be kept at room temperature and in a draft-free, dry space. Don\u2019t make the mistake and get a cage that is too small, thinking that a cockatiel is small as it is. Parrots \u2013 no matter the size \u2013 need as much space as possible. Otherwise, they can become a depressed and unhealthy bird, picking out their feathers and developing health issues. In general, these are strong and resilient birds, with longevity to boot. However, some key clues that indicate something is wrong should be remembered. These include apathy and overall lack of activity, puffy and ruffled feathers or loss of appetite and weight. Although these symptoms are rare, they can still occur. In general, cockatiels are strong and adapt easily to common surroundings. With just the basic effort and care, your pet will thrive and be happy! On average, cockatiels can live between 16 to 25 years, making them great companion pets. The record holding cockatiel in captivity lived for an amazing 36 years.  Take care of your cockatiel\u2019s needs \u2013 interaction and plenty of space are important for its health. Cockatiels are friendly and social, playful birds. A wide and spacious cage will do them good, as they require plenty of exercise and room to play. Perches and parrot toys will help keep this smart bird entertained, but it\u2019s best to get a pair of Cockatiels to keep each other company while you\u2019re at work. These affectionate birds also love to socialize and interact. Devote a bit of your time to play with your pet, teaching them new tricks or simply giving them attention- without your company; your feathered pet is bound to get moody and aggressive.

Make sure to keep everything in optimal condition, especially the house temperatures.

These pretty parrots have been rising in popularity since the 1970s, both as an aviary bird and a household pet. The Elegant Parrot will surprise you with their smart and inquisitive behavior, and their feistiness will always go against their small size. A good choice for experienced owners, they will require good care and can thrive in aviaries.   Much like Budgies, these little parrots have a charming personality and can make great pets. These birds are found naturally in two separate regions in Australia. One is in the southwestern corner, while the other is more to the southeast. As these regions are separate, they provide diverse habitats, and the Elegant Parrot thrives in all of them. They are found below 500 meters, mostly in light woodlands, Eucalyptus growths, savannah, and Acacia shrubbery. One of the rarer breeds that are not threatened, the Elegant Parrot is stable in the wild and their numbers are actually increasing. The Neophema genus, commonly known as the Grass Parrot family, includes seven breeds, but they are all unique in their own way. The Elegant Parrot has some iconic features that are easy to recognize. The round, chubby body, a small head, and a very small beak, and a long, quite pointy tail are all easily spotted. The adults reach an average length of 9 inches (22 centimeters)- a big part of which is the tail and will weigh just around 2 ounces (50 grams). There\u2019s no doubt that these parrots are as elegant as their name suggests, but they are also incredibly cute.  Most parrots and parakeets of this size are not really vocal birds or skilled at talking of mimicry. This applies to the Elegant Parrot, whose only abilities are its natural calls. Luckily, these are not obtrusive and are very similar to other birds of this size, like the popular Budgies or Turquoise Parrots. Series of repeated chirps and loud tweets are relatively easy to tolerate and might even make the Elegant Parrot suited for apartment settings. Even though the Elegant Parrot might seem plain at first glance, there are a few really unique details that are almost never seen in the world of parrots. In any case, their name fits them perfectly, as they are graceful and beautiful little birds. The body is mostly yellowish green or olive in color. The belly shows much lighter, almost yellow tones, while the back is darker. The very front of the face is yellow, with a peculiar thin strip that stretches between the eyes. This strip is dark blue on the lower half and turquoise blue on the top. The same two colors are repeated in a strip that covers the wing edges. The lower side of the tail is yellow. In aviculture, breeders created a few artificial and unique color mutations. These little birds are a lovely sight. A truly Elegant parrot! Even though they are almost identical, the females might have duller colors, which can help with identification. Foundation of a  good diet for your pet should be one of the common commercial seed mixes for small parakeets. For example, a budgie seed mix is a good choice. Add plenty of finely chopped fresh fruits and vegetables, and there you have it- a basic diet for an Elegant Parrot. Another important aspect of good care is free flight. Elegant Parrot who is stuck in a cage for a lot of time during the day can succumb to apathy, illness, and even death. You must provide a lot of free flight during the day and social interaction. Building a relationship with your pet is paramount. There is a common belief that Elegant Parrot might require a bit of extra attention. This might not be completely true, as these parakeets are not too demanding as pets. Just provide good basic care and plenty of interaction. Also, ensure a lot of freedom, and you will quickly realize that these little parrots require so little to thrive.  Young and hand-reared birds will adapt so much better to life in the house, and a bond will be created quickly. Much like Budgies, these little parrots have a charming personality and can make great pets.

Popular pet birds, these lovebirds are famous for their mischievous, inquisitive nature, and are loved as funny, cute and in-general playful birds. Small and nimble, Fischer\u2019s Lovebirds are a handful of fun, certain to put a smile on everyone\u2019s face with their antics and tricks. They are entertaining, cute and demand a lot of socializing and play time. This makes Fischer\u2019s Lovebirds a perfect family pet. Fischer\u2019s Lovebirds are the picture of cuteness! They are playful little explorers. The natural habitat of this particular lovebird breed is exclusive to a small region in Tanzania, south and southeast of the famous Lake Victoria. There, they live in flocks, preferring small clumps of trees in the midst of the regions vast grass plains. In the wild, the populations reach up to a million birds, while in captivity these birds are popular and readily available as pets. They share a lot of traits with most other lovebirds, and likewise, the Fischer\u2019s Lovebird is a small bird. Usually, they\u2019ll grow to about 5.5 inches, and weigh up to 2 ounces. They have a small, stocky frame, and unlike most parrots \u2013 a short, blunt tail. Their beaks are large and sharp, and also the bird\u2019s favorite tool, which they often use for mischievous purposes! The Fischer\u2019s Lovebird is vocal and noisy little parrots. Being highly social and requiring a lot of interaction, they will sing in their loud, shrill and sometimes piercing high pitched voice, as a part of their nature. Though the sounds can be lively and fun at times, for some people, they can be rather noisy and tiring when prolonged. Of course, this also means that these little lovebirds are not a good choice for apartments. These birds are mostly of a vibrant and bright green color, with yellow gradients underneath, on their belly. Their cheeks, throat and forehead are of a distinctively reddish orange color. This combination gives them their unique and recognizable look. Their eyes are rounded by a visible white ring, making identification easy. Sometimes, the top of their tails can show a dim blue color. In captivity, the breeders created several color mutation that can also be seen often. These include yellow, blue and white colors. These birds have bright and lovely color combinations that are easily recognizable. Fischer\u2019s Lovebirds will eat a wide variety of foods. Mostly, these are centered on seed mixes and fruits. Be sure to add fresh fruits as well, to ensure a varied and healthy diet. Being very active and inquisitive, even though small, they will prefer a large and roomy cage. This will satisfy their need to be active and move about. A chance to fly freely and explore around the house will keep them occupied and entertained, preventing boredom and apathy. Of course, if you plan on letting your bird out of its cage, make sure you\u2019ve parrot-proofed your house: this means closing all doors and windows, removing houseplants that are toxic to pet birds, and hiding electrical cables. Apathy and prolonged silence is a sure sign of a problem in Fischer\u2019s Lovebirds. Another issue is feather picking, a result of loneliness or boredom. These are very socially dependent birds, so they are often kept in pairs. In general, they are healthy throughout their lifespan, which can reach up to 15 years. Be sure to provide a partner for your Lovebird. They will love the company and the interaction. As they are flocking birds in the wild, these vocal avians thrive in company, and their highly social behavior is not reserved only for other members of the species: if they were hand fed, Fischer\u2019s Lovebirds will be more than happy to interact with their owner. These little birds are all about activity. They are quite the little explorers and mischievous troublemakers. They love to chew, and figure out how things work. Given a chance, they\u2019ll hide about the house, attempt to open their cages, nibble on your buttons or jewelry, and in general \u2013 be quite the little devils.

They inhabit a crescent-shaped region, mostly spanning from southwest Queensland to Victoria, while also including the Kangaroo Island.

One of the iconic habitats for these parrots are the Casuarina trees, which also makes a big part of their diet. They adapted to thrive on the cones of this tree.

We all know that cockatoos have a worldwide reputation for their noise levels and their chatty, raucous personality. But that\u2019s one aspect in which the black Cockatoos stand apart. True to their much more calmer personality, their noise levels are equally low and tolerable. The natural calls of a Glossy Black Cockatoo consist of a variety of squawks, but they most often simply murmur to themselves in mimicry of conversation.

The simplicity of their appearance is in a sense what gives them their peculiar charm. Birds with such dark looks have an air of elegance and mystery to them, which always makes highly sought after. This all-black parrot has a few contrasting details which make them easily recognized. The males have a slightly lighter black head, and their tail feathers have a mix of red and black patches. The females are lighter black and have yellow specks on the neck and tail. This difference between the sexes will make it easy to know how to name your pet and provide better care.  A hand-raised Glossy Black Cockatoo will be much friendlier and affectionate than any other black Cockatoo breed. In the wild, these cockatoos thrive on a varied diet. But the biggest part of it is the unique Casuarina trees and their peculiar cone fruits. Their large and robust beaks are specially adapted to break things apart. They also eat wood-boring grubs and fruit. If possible, include Casuarina seeds in their diet, but you can also base it on nuts, certain seeds, and fruits. You can also provide a whole range of special, sterilized bird toys to help them exercise the very strong and large beak. Chewed toys are better than chewed furniture!

Luckily, with a bit of patience and familiarizing you\u2019ll see that these parrots are generally friendly and sociable and you will quickly get to love your little Goffin and all the fun it brings to the house. Goffin\u2019s cockatoo is one of the smallest in its family, and one of the funniest and most energetic ones as well. The Maluku islands cover a vast territory and are full of wonderful and unique parrots. In the south of these islands lies the Tanimbar archipelago, the natural home of the Goffin\u2019s Cockatoo- hence their other common name, Tanimbar corella. Here they inhabit the tropical, forested regions, gathering in small flocks. These cockatoos suffered much in the wild, and are now a near threatened breed. As an outcome of heavy logging and subsequent illegal capture that swept these islands, there are far more Goffin\u2019s in captivity than there are in the wild. Considered one of the smaller cockatoos, they reach an average size of 12 inches (30 centimeters) in length and a weight of 11 ounces (300 grams). They have a more rounded, chubbier look than their cousins, but are generally similar. Like all the members of this family, they too share the one distinguishing, unique trait \u2013 their crest. When scared, happy or otherwise roused, they will fan out their graceful plume of feathers on the top of the head. These lovely birds can live to be 40 years old, so make sure to have that in mind if you want a Goffin\u2019s cockatoo as a pet. There are some facts you should always keep in mind when getting a cockatoo pet. One of these is the level of noise. These parrots are quite vocal and love to express their mood with loud, high pitched caws and screeches. They also like to imitate human speech in an equally loud and often incomprehensible mumble. The level of noise goes down if your pet is entertained, satisfied and gets enough of attention. However, this trait  makes them not so suitable to be an apartment-kept parrot. Goffin\u2019s cockatoos are almost completely mono colored, but nevertheless cute and beautiful parrots. They are entirely white, with black feet and a gray beak. A small spot between the eye and the beak is colored in bright pink, which serves as a distinct marking. There is also a slight yellow tone on the underside of the tail and wings. Despite the lack of exotic patterns and striking colors, this cockatoo is equally pretty and captivates with its graceful, gentle look. With its gentle and elegant look, the Goffin\u2019s cockatoo offers a welcome change from all the exotic and brightly colored parrots. A varied natural diet that consists of different fruits, seeds, nuts and palm flowers, is closely resembled in the standard commercial seed mixes designed for cockatoos. This should be supplemented with a regular addition of fresh fruits and vegetables, such as spinach, kale, cabbage, apples, oranges, and bananas. As these cockatoos are avid chewers, a cuttlebone is a smart choice \u2013 it helps keep the beak trimmed, and serves as an important dose of calcium and other vitamins. When first bred in captivity, the Goffin\u2019s Cockatoo endurance and ability to adapt were praised. They are generally very healthy and hardy birds. The biggest threats are some of those common dangers to all parrots \u2013 cold temperatures, drafts, toxic fumes, excessive heat and lack of ventilation. This, as well as good hygiene and diet,  should always be under control.  As the Goffin\u2019s Cockatoo is quite energetic, inquisitive and intelligent, a lot of room is imperative. Allow them to fly freely around the home during the at day, and for night time they should have a large, spacious cage. These cockatoos should have a lot of free room. Their size and inquisitive personality should be taken into account. High intelligence as well as an affectionate -but often spoiled- personality are the main traits of Goffin\u2019s cockatoos. They can often act like drama queens (and kings) showing you loud and clear that things are not as they want them to be. They also tend to bond deeply to a single person in the home and then act grumpy and territorial towards other family members.  These traits are generally evened out with their sociable and loving side, and the endless fun and goofy antics.

These lively parrots are incredibly fun \u2013 their rich personality is an endless source of laughter and surprises. One of the biggest clowns in aviculture, these exotic parrots are at the very top when it comes to fun and beauty as well. Even if they are an expensive pet and slightly hard to come by, every effort will be worth it in the end. They are also one of the breeds that are often rescued from shelters! If a chance comes by \u2013 don\u2019t hesitate \u2013 buy or adopt, and you won\u2019t regret it. The Golden Conure is truly a one-of-a-kind bird. Their scientific name, Guaruba, comes from the Tupi native word, meaning \u201csmall yellow macaw\u201d. These parrots, also known in aviculture as Golden Parakeets or Queen of Bavaria Conures, are native to a small region in South America. They inhabit a narrow and relatively small range in northern Brazil. It spans between three rivers \u2013 the Tocantins, Tapajos, and Xingu. Sadly, these birds are a vulnerable breed, suffering greatly in the eighties. Rapid deforestation, illegal trapping for pet markets and predators, all led to a big decline in numbers. Today, they are highly protected.   Golden Conure has a few similarities with certain macaw breeds, but they are not connected \u2013 this is a unique and separate species. They are medium in size, with a striking and robust appearance. The adults reach an average length of 13 inches (34 centimeters) and will weigh about half a pound (270 grams). The first things to notice are the large and powerful macaw-like beak and a wide tail. They have a large wingspan and will require a LOT of space. Consider an aviary or a very large cage, in order for your pet to thrive. But most often, these pets are a part of the family \u2013 with the freedom of the house at their disposal. Just make sure to secure everything before you let your pet parrot roam around! We mentioned that the Golden Conure is full of adorable traits. One of those is their peculiar (and cute!) passion for talking. Common words and phrases are easily repeated, but there\u2019s also the loved parrot-talk \u2013 the mumbling that resembles human speech. They are also skilled mimics, often repeating common sounds like kisses, beeps, and barks. These parrots are very receptive to music, and will not hesitate to dance and do a host of silly tricks when the beat drops. When the Golden Conures are around, the flashy patterns and exotic colors become a thing of the past. Who said that simplicity is dull? These graceful and elegant parrots will prove you wrong. The body is entirely colored in a bright, rich yellow, its intensity rarely seen in aviculture. The wing tips are a rich tropical green, providing an adequate contrast and adding a bit of variety.

In addition, your pet should have supplements in the form of protein-rich foods. Cooked corn, beans, and pulses, as well as fruits and vegetables, should be included in the diet. For the Golden Conure, a well-balanced diet is a huge part of proper care. Baths and showers should also be regular, serving as rewards and prerequisites for good health.  These are healthy and relatively long-lived parrots, with an average lifespan of up to 30 years. This, paired with a fun personality, will make them great companion parrots.

With its flamboyant and extravagant appearance, uniqueness and an energetic personality, these parrots have a lot to offer to every owner. After Australian aviculturists rallied to promote these parrots to a wider, international audience, the birds have been introduced to breeders around Europe. This helps to establish a stable population in captivity and aviculture, helping to preserve this declining breed. Golden Shouldered Parrot is truly a one-of-a-kind sight, and one of Australia\u2019s most colorful birds. Generally friendly and peaceful, these beautiful parrots make great pets for experienced owners and beginners alike. These parrots are restricted to two isolated regions in Australia. One is the larger part in the northeast, and a smaller region on the Cape York Peninsula and northern Queensland. They thrive in open woodlands, dry grasslands and areas with Eucalyptus and Melaleuca trees. Their alternative name \u2013 the Anthill Parrot \u2013 comes from their nesting habits. They will build their nests in damp termite mounds. Sadly, these parrots are an endangered species. Mostly affected by habitat loss and threats from predators such as the Pied Butcherbird. They have been also trapped for the pet market from the late \u201950s to the \u201970s.  These parrots share their physical aspects with other breeds in the Australian Grass Parakeet family, such as Bluebonnets, the Red Rumped and Turquoise Parrots. You can notice the tapered long tail and a distinctly small beak. The adults reach an average length of 10 inches (26 centimeters) and weigh just 2 ounces (60 grams). Small, slender, and energetic, these parrots will require a lot of space to satisfy their need for exercise. An aviary, a walk-in bird room or a spacious and roomy cage will be required. Their natural calls consist of two-tone melodic sounds and occasional whistles. As is the case with most of Australia\u2019s Grass Parakeets, they are not overly noisy. When compared to some other exotic parrots, the Golden Shouldered Parrot has a much more subtle natural call. Their melodic chirps and tweets, as well as whistling sounds, are easily tolerated and adapted to. When kept as an aviary bird, they make even less noise. The Golden Shouldered Parrot is a real eye-catcher. One of the more unique birds in aviculture, these parrots display a stunning mix of colors. In addition, the great difference between males and females provides another striking variation inside the breed. The males are mostly bright, sky blue with gray-brown back and wings. Two prominent yellow patches on the lower half of the wings give them a showy detail. The lower abdomen, thighs, and legs are pinkish red, reminiscent of pants. The top of the head has a black crown, with a smaller yellow patch just above the beak. The females are mostly yellowish green. The belly is cream colored, and the rump is pink. The top of the head is light gray.  Golden Shouldered Parrot displays a drastic sexual dimorphism: the males and females have a completely different appearance. For a  Golden Shouldered Parrot, the diet should be based around commercial seed mixes. Any of the seed mixes that are designed for Budgies, Rock parrots or Turquoise parakeets will do. When combined with a lot of fresh fruits, this diet will provide your pet with all of the essentials. A good addition is a cuttlebone. It replenishes calcium and gives your pet a chance to work on their beak. As a bonus point: it also saves the furniture from potential damage! With an average lifespan of around 15 years or more, the Golden Shouldered Parrot is relatively easy to look after and will adapt to most temperate conditions. The most important thing to ensure this is to pay attention to some of the basic needs. For exotic parrots, social interaction plays a big role. It keeps your pet stimulated and deepens the bond between you. Daily interaction will go a long way. If kept in pairs, the Golden Shouldered parrots will thrive best in an aviary, with adequate nesting options. Generally friendly and peaceful, these beautiful parrots make great pets for experienced owners and beginners alike. With enough interaction, they can even become cuddly and welcome handling, which is not often the case with exotic breeds. To satisfy their energetic nature, provide them with plenty of toys, perches or artificial branches. They will enjoy having a natural aspect in their surroundings. Many owners in Australia keep these parrots in pairs in aviaries. This gives them both the chance to enjoy the company of their own kind and live in an environment that mimics their habitat to a degree. If you decide to keep a Golden Shouldered Parrot in a cage, make sure it\u2019s big enough- and let them out frequently for free flight around the room.", "facts": " Parakeet Blue, Yellowish Green with details Vocal, Natural calls, Moderately loud, Whistler", "tags": "Australian Grass Parakeets, exotic pet birds, Golden-shouldered parrot, pet birds for aviaries, pet birds for experienced owners, rare pet birds, unique pet birds, "}, "gouldian finch": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/bird/gouldian-finch/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gouldian-finch.jpg", "name": "Gouldian Finch", "type": "bird", "text": "Gouldian Finch is considered by some to be amongst the prettiest members of the finch family of birds.

With one of these lovely little birds as your pet, you are sure to bring the rainbow indoors! A Gouldian Finch is best known for its striking appearance- its rainbow colors are quite a unique sight. John Gould, a British explorer, first noted these birds in mid-1800\u2019s, in their natural home of the extreme north of Australia. Their most numerous populations are located in the Northern Territory, near the towns of Wyndham and Katherine. They prefer to live in the region\u2019s sparse woodlands and the tropical savannas of the Australian northwest. Water sources are always nearby, and they fluctuate from one to the other, migrating as their needs dictate. Like all the other finches, the Gouldians are small birds as well, and they will usually grow up to 6 inches (about 15 centimeters). The females can be easily spotted as they tend to be smaller and less brightly colored than the males. An interesting aspect is seen in the young birds \u2013 until they reach adulthood, their plumage is mostly grey. In time, as they grow up, it will become distinctively colorful and bright.

They are indeed wonderful and regaling birds that will break up the monotony of the day with their lovely song. Another of the favorite aspects of Lady Gouldians, is their incredible and exotic mix of colors. Their faces are striking and colored entirely in either black, red or yellow. The back and wings are bright, tropical green, while their chest is colored in a unique and brilliant shade of purple. The belly is golden yellow. With these colors mixed up, the Gouldian finches carry with them a little bit of their tropical Australian homeland. From bright purple to yellow and tropical green \u2013 the Gouldian finch is a whirlwind of exotic colors. Even though their needs will be met with a commercial, store-bought seed mix, you should still add a regular dose of fresh vegetables. Offer your Gouldian Finch lettuce, spinach, carrots, and celery. Mealworms can also be added, as they are a source of valuable proteins a finch will need. Daily changes of fresh water are a must, and a regular bird bath will be thoroughly enjoyed by your pet finch Finches are known for their strong and healthy nature, even though they are small and fragile-looking. Main things to avoid are cold and drafty places, lousy hygiene and cramped cages. They are nimble and active and move a lot. That\u2019s why a spacious, large cage is a must. And you shouldn\u2019t forget that a certain amount of social interaction is also required to keep your finch healthy: lack of company will directly affect the well-being of these little birds. Finches are healthy and hardy. Just avoid cold and draft and you\u2019ll have no troubles raising a happy, strong pet bird.

And how couldn\u2019t they be, with their unique looks, robust health and friendly personality? Although quite large, Great-billed Parrot is calm and laid-back, with a docile and sociable temperament. This breed is also known as Moluccan Parrot or Island Parrot. Just as their name suggests, these parrots have disproportionately large beaks. Provide plenty of toys so they can exercise it. These parrots are found in a small region in southeast Asia, chiefly in the waters closest to Indonesia.

This breed prefers to live on small islands, and large groups will often travel from one island to another. They thrive in mangroves, humid forests, coastal woodlands, and local plantations. They are a common sight in these tropical islands and are not endangered critically. Still, they are not often seen as pets, but they do appear in markets from time to time.  They belong to a small genus of parrots, called Tanygnathus, and are very unique in their physical appearance and personality traits.

An aviary or a spacious cage is a must, as well as plenty of free movement around the house during the day.

They are inquisitive parrots that don\u2019t express themselves vocally. They do have some natural calls, most of which are moderate and rarely heard throughout the day.

To create a balanced diet for your pet, you should start with a commercial seed mix for exotic large parrots. They contain a good amount of oats, millet, sunflower seeds, and nuts \u2013 all of which are rich in nutrients. The next and larger part of their diet should be fresh fruits and plenty of it. Apples, pears, oranges, bananas, and coconuts \u2013 these treats are their favorites. Some green vegetables are also welcome. Fresh water should be replaced two or more times per day.

Becoming increasingly popular in the 1980s, mostly in Australia, these parrots have ever since established a name for themselves as hardy and loving pets. They captivate owners with their lively and energetic personality and the flashy and flamboyant appearance. Just like most members of the Australian Parakeet family, these parrots also display extreme dimorphism, which makes the females entirely different. Whether you live in an apartment or in a house, you\u2019ll find Hooded Parrot to be a lovely companion. These parrots are native to a part of Australia that is best known for being dry, arid and inhospitable \u2013 the Northern Territories. They are found in a wide region that spans from Mary and Daly rivers and stretches across the Northern territories all the way to the Carpentaria Gulf. Hooded Parrot thrives in Melaleuca woodlands, grasslands, termite mound areas and Eucalyptus woodlands along rivers. Luckily this breed is not endangered, and no decline has been recorded for more than ten years. Their biggest threats remain wildfires, overgrazing, and loss of habitat.  All Grass parakeets, particularly the Psephotellus family, display a lot of physical similarities. Some of the distinct features you can easily spot are the long and tapered tail, a distinct beak, and a chubby body. And of course, their extreme dimorphism. The adults reach an average length of 10 inches (26 centimeters) and will weigh 2 ounces (60 grams) on average. More than half of their overall length is actually their oversized tail. Even so, the Hooded Parrot will require a spacious cage. When placed in cramped conditions, the birds are at risk for a variety of health and behavioral problems.  The Hooded Parrot is not overly noisy. These birds mostly become vocal in aviaries, due to their territorial behavior when placed around other species of parrots. This is the reason why most owners prefer to keep them as house pets, either on their own or in pairs. Their natural calls are a combination of tweets and melodic chirps, some of which can occasionally be shrill. Still, provided they have enough room, a Hooded Parrot can be a suitable pet for both apartments and household settings. Easily one of Australia\u2019s most striking parrot breeds, the Hooded Parrot leaves a lasting impression. The vibrant, bright colors in combination with the soft pastel tones, create an extravagant appearance. In addition, the major differences between males and females are all color related, so this provides even more variety color-wise. The males are mostly turquoise blue, very bright. Their wings are bright yellow, with the back being brown-grey. Their most distinct detail, and the one that gives them the name, is the top half of the head \u2013 it\u2019s completely black. Starting with a diagonal line just below the eye, this black color gives an impression of a hood. The females are much simpler in their appearance, with the body being entirely olive green, with lighter tones on the chest and a brown patch on the forehead.  In addition to the natural feather colors, these parrots also come in a distinct yellow artificial color mutation. Commercial seed mixes are a great choice for your pet Hooded Parrot. As grass parrots, seeds make up a large part of their natural nutrition, so you can\u2019t go wrong there. One of the biggest concerns, though, is space. Most birds associations in Australia advise owners of this breed to provide as much exercise as possible, in order to ensure a healthy lifestyle for these birds.  When taken care of, Hooded Parrot will prove to be a healthy pet- luckily, they\u2019re easy to look after. They are praised for their lifespan and sturdy nature. One thing to keep in mind is the aviary setting. Some larger birds might pick on them, and Hooded Parrot will surely become territorial during breeding time. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to keep these birds as regular, cage parrots. Hooded parrots display a long lifespan as pets. With good care, they can live up to 25 years. The Hooded Parrot can be a loving, rewarding pet parrot- if you meet its needs. They prefer to be the only feathery pet in the household and love to be in the spotlight of the family. With enough social interaction, they quickly display their inquisitive and often mischievous side, as they love to chew and mess up anything they can. To remedy this, you should provide a bunch of parrot toys or soft cardboard items.

With numbers rapidly declining and protective measures being introduced, these lively cockatoos are struggling for survival in the wild. They are often mistaken for some very similar cockatoo breeds, despite having a lot of distinctive traits. So let\u2019s learn more about these parrots and understand what kind of pets they actually are. Despite their popularity and affectionate nature, these cockatoos are one of the most endangered exotic birds today. Like some of the related cockatoo breeds, the Lesser Sulphur Crested Cockatoo is originally found on Sulawesi and Lesser Sunda islands. These islands are part of East Timor and Indonesia and are home to many exotic parrots. Due to extensive illegal trapping, these parrots have been proclaimed as critically endangered. This designation is the last step before extinction. With just a few thousand remaining birds, survival in the wild is in question.  Another, introduced population, exists in Hong Kong. It grew from a small number of caged parrots, released into the city just before Japanese invasion in 1941.  Lesser Sulphur Crested Cockatoo is considered to be a medium-sized bird, and these birds share their general appearance with other close related cockatoo breeds. The adults reach an average length of 13 inches (34 centimeters) and both sexes are almost identical. They have all the visual traits of cockatoos \u2013 the prominent, bulging forehead, a stubby beak, distinct eyes and the iconic crest. Lesser Sulphur Crested Cockatoos also have a remarkable wingspan, so ensure a plenty of free space for your pet. Before committing to a pet cockatoo, you might want to know that they can be very, very loud. Even if they might not be the best talkers, they can repeat a few words coherently. The rest of the noise comes from their loud attempts to mimic human speech and conversations. This results in a noisy, repetitive and always funny flood of mumbled words, yells and even screams. With a little patience, you can get used to these silly outbursts of noise, but your neighbors might not \u2013 that\u2019s why cockatoos are not apartment birds! Exotic and colorful looks are not always the measure of beauty for a parrot. The best proof of this is the simple and elegant look of the Lesser Sulphur Crested Cockatoo. The body is entirely white, with slight yellowish tinges on the wing tips and underneath the tails. The distinct crest is prominent and bright yellow. Another cute detail is the two pale yellow circles on the cheeks. This simple look is pronounced with the gray feet and beak. Although it\u2019s lacking a diversity in colors, this cockatoo is still a very pretty and charming bird. Simple is not always dull. The Lesser Sulphur Crested Cockatoo looks elegant and graceful with their pure white plumage. In the wild, these cockatoos thrive on a variety of insects, seeds, flower buds and fruits. A seed-based mix for cockatoos will be a great choice for your pet\u2019s diet. But it won\u2019t be enough. Most of the important vitamins and proteins are found in added fruits and vegetables. So don\u2019t hesitate to introduce apples, oranges, cabbage, and carrots to their diet. Cockatoos have powerful beaks that sometimes need trimming. A natural, affordable, and a healthy way to do this is with a cuttlebone.  Cockatoos are hardy and well-built birds and thanks to this,  they usually have no serious health issues. Their biggest threats are the skin and feather diseases that can often lead to further complications. Proper hygiene can help prevent these issues. So don\u2019t hesitate to offer regular baths to your cockatoo. This can be through bathing dishes, or even better \u2013 in the shower.

They have an incredible lifespan that reaches between 50 to 70 years, with some sources indicating a potential 100 years of age.

Always provide your pet with enough room and freedom to fly around the house. This is a foundation of health and happiness in birds.

Although endangered in the wild, these parrots are relatively common as pets and are loved for their funny, outgoing, and mischievous personality. Sharing a lot of similarities with their close cousins, they have plenty of traits you can expect from an Amazon, but a few tricks up their sleeve as well. Let\u2019s meet the Red Headed Amazon! Social, energetic and talkative \u2013 the Red Crowned parrots are the Amazons we know and love. As the name suggests, the natural home of these birds is found in the forests that sprawl in the northeast of Mexico. Their large and noisy flocks can be spotted in the tree canopies in the morning and sundown when they are most active. A few feral populations exist outside the natural habitat \u2013 mainly in California, Florida, Texas, and Hawaii. Sadly, the wild population numbers only around 2000 birds, and this breed is officially endangered. Destruction of the forests in Mexico, illegal trapping, and smuggling, have all caused this critical decline. Mexican Red Headed Amazon shares many physical similarities with the rest of their family.  But a few crucial details in both their looks and personality make them stand out. The adult birds reach an average length of around 13 inches (33 centimeters) and can weigh up to 10 ounces (270 grams). They also have a large wingspan \u2013 up to 16 inches (40 centimeters).  Roomy cage and plenty of space are mandatory. These parrots are not sexually dimorphic \u2013 this means that males and females are identical. We all know that the biggest pride of all the Amazons is their great ability to talk, sing and mimic. It should not come as a surprise when your pet develops a substantial vocabulary or displays its great arsenal of memorized melodies and common sounds. They are certain to be at the center of attention, showing off their mimics in a goofy voice. They also have loud and often harsh natural calls, but these are usually heard only twice a day in short periods. Still, an Amazon parrot is best kept as a house pet, to avoid noise complaints. Most Amazons share a generally similar image. The Mexican Red Headed Amazon displays striking tropical colors and is almost entirely green, with slightly darker shades on the wings and back. The distinct details that give them the name are based on the head. The forehead is bright red, with prominent purple or blue streaks just behind the eyes.  Their cheeks are also green, but much lighter than the rest of the body. This simple coloration with prominent head details draws the attention to their pretty faces and their striking eyes.  These brightly colored, tropical parrots are a cheerful and a vibrant presence. Their best detail is their pretty face. In the wild, these parrots subside on a variety of seeds, fruits, flower nectar and tree blossoms. As pets, the first and best choice should be the commercial seed mix designed and prepared just for Amazons. This has all the necessary bits and pieces to offer them an enjoyable and healthy diet. But you\u2019ll need to add some much-needed vitamins in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables. Being larger parrots, your Amazons should enjoy an occasional meal of cooked rice, corn or chicken. These hardy parrots are noted for their ability to adapt and endure most temperate conditions. Like a lot of larger birds, they can be prone to some feather loss due to neglect, loneliness, stress and bad hygiene. To avoid this, you must offer regular baths. This can be achieved by bathing dishes, regular showers, mist sprays or baths in the standard kitchen sink. Either one of these will be a treat for your Mexican Red Headed Amazon \u2013 they adore it! Regular baths are a great treat for an Amazon parrot and serve as a good protection against skin related disease. For anyone who is looking for an energetic, intelligent parrot that will bond with their owner, an Amazon is always the best choice. You can always rely on their fun personality to entertain you. With all the talking, the mimics, the silly tricks or simply their cuddlier side, a Mexican Red Headed Amazon will always prove a great pet parrot.

The Pearly Conure, also known as Pearly Parakeet, is a real goof and one of the gentler members of this species. When compared to the much popular Maroon Bellied Conure or Black Capped Conure, these birds have much calmer personalities and are rare on the pet market, making them very sought-after. But thanks to their endlessly fun behavior, every member of this family has great potential and they often become stars of social media platforms such as Instagram, where they are loved for their antics, tricks, and cute looks. Let\u2019s get to know these adorable clowns!    Owing to their goofy nature, love for various tricks, and friendliness, Pearly Conure is a treasured pet around the world. Found only in a relatively small region in Brazil, they span parts of provinces of Para and Maranhao. They are a vulnerable breed, with only 10,000 birds remaining in the wild. Pearly Conure thrives mostly in the regional tropical rainforests, and are also spotted on its edges and sporadic clearings. Brazil\u2019s irresponsible policy towards wildlife has contributed to the diminishing of this breed. Heavy logging, destruction of habitat and flooding are the main causes. In the eastern edges of its habitat, one of its subspecies is nearing extinction because of this.  The famous Pyrrhura conures are undeniably striking, but often quite similar among themselves. Sometimes only a detail will help differentiate them, like a brighter hue of feathers. But what they all share are physical traits like their stout body and a peculiarly cute look that cannot be resisted. The adult Pearly Conure reaches an average length of  9 inches (24 centimeters) and can weigh around an ounce (40 grams). The first thing that you\u2019ll notice, after the stunning appearance, is their energy. These little goofs are constantly hopping about from place to place, and they are really lively. This requires a very spacious cage and plenty of exercise around your home. Conures are known to be noticeably quieter than some other, larger exotic parrots. Their natural calls are soft, with brief moments of shrill and loud calls in the morning and late noon. While the popular Sun and Jenday Conure can be considered noisy, the Pearly Conure is much quieter. They will often chatter softly, muttering something to themselves, but can also be trained to repeat some basic syllables and words, with a bit of patient training of course.  All the little details and intricate patterns that are hiding in the plumage of the Pearly Conure makes them exceptionally charming. The body is mostly dark, forest green. The nape, neck, and head are black, with prominent tones of light gray. These two colors combined, give a peculiar pattern that gives them their name. Red lines on the shoulders complete this look and give them an interesting detail that stands out and provides contrast. One thing is for sure, seeing a Pearly Conure up close is definitely going to leave a lasting impression.  Pearly Conure is one of the quietest breeds in the species- they make a good choice for spacious apartments.  In their natural habitat, these conures thrive with the help of a varied diet. Usually, it consists of the basics \u2013 fruits, insects, seeds and crops. For a good beginners diet, choose a commercial seed mix for conures or parakeets. This is the best choice for your pet, as it has all the important nutrients that are found in seeds like maize, rye, oats, and millet. Bathing your pet parrot should be a big part of your weekly routine. It makes your pet happy, promotes a bond between the parrot and the owner, and maintains hygiene. This three-in-one aspect makes bathing a priority. These are robust and hardy birds, even if their size and cute appearance say otherwise. As pets, they are documented to live for more than 20 years, which makes them a good choice as companion parrots. But their health needs to be maintained. Avoid confined spaces and prolonged stay in a cage. The cage itself needs to be of a minimal length of 6.5 feet (2 meters) and filled with perches, swings, ropes and sterilized parrot toys. These goodies will help satisfy the curious and playful nature of these parrots and give you a bit of time for yourself. A bird room is also a great option for the Pearly Conure. Offer a cuttlebone to your parrot pet. It is a great source of calcium and other vitamins. The Pearly Conure might be among the rarer breeds in their family, but it doesn\u2019t diminish their popularity. Owing to their goofy nature, love for various tricks, and friendliness, they are a treasured pet around the world. In fact, there are a lot of these adorable birds that have also conquered the social media and became bona fide Instagram and YouTube stars because of their charm.

Tiny and adorable, these South American parakeets will easily captivate you with their friendly and sweet personality. And once you get to see their silly, inquisitive side as well, you will be swept off your feet.

These little birds are native to a large region in South America, mostly in central and southeastern Brazil. In the wild, they thrive in the forest canopy, lowlands, and secondary growth.

Some very simple sounds might be repeated, but this is rare. In general, Plain Parakeet is an ideal candidate for an apartment pet bird. For some, simplicity comes as a downside. Most owners love to see an exotic combination of feather hues. But that\u2019s not what the Plain Parakeet is about. Just as their name suggests, their appearance is simple and straightforward, and they are one of the plainer-looking parrots in aviculture. But nonetheless, their adorable appearance is undeniable. Both adults are entirely green, with slightly darker shades on the wing and back. In truth, the intensity of this green color varies and fluctuates throughout their body, and shows a great variation, considering it\u2019s a single color. Don\u2019t be dissuaded by a simple appearance. Even if they are \u201cplain\u201d, these parakeets still pack in a lot of charm in their tiny frame. From apartment dwellers to families, singles, and seniors, these pet birds will adapt to any type of household. Your pet\u2019s diet should be varied, but you will need to keep in mind that around 30% of their meals will need to be based on fruits. Fresh apples, pears, bananas, oranges, and similar fresh yummies will need to be the foundation. The rest is reserved for vegetables and small parrot seed mixes. When talking about care, keep in mind that the Plain Parakeet is an avid flyer and chewer. This will require a lot of space for flying, and a bunch of parrot toys. With these things taken care of, you will have a happy pet on your hands. Don\u2019t be fooled by their slender and small size. These parakeets are hardy and healthy. After all, they adapted to thrive in the wild, despite the loss of their original habitat. With good care and attention, their lifespan can reach a good age of 15 years. To keep a Plain Parakeet happy and satisfied, provide plenty of space and perches, but most of all \u2013 your love.

But most of all, Port Lincolns are very charming, with their unique coloring and very cute overall looks. Often kept as a beautiful aviary bird, this exotic bird breed is also known as Australian Parakeet, Bauer\u2019s Parakeet, Banded Parrot, Yellow-naped Parrot,  and Twenty-eight Parrot.

Loved worldwide for their fun personality, wonderful looks, and cute talking abilities, Princess Parrot has everything that a perfect pet bird needs.  These birds were named in honor of Alexandra, the Princess of Denmark and the eventual Queen of United Kingdom. These are one of Australia\u2019s pretties, but also most elusive parrot species. They are found in the interior, mostly in parts of Western and Central Australia, spanning a region from the Great Sandy Desert, all the way to Goldfields in the west. The reason for its elusiveness is their habitat, a highly nomadic movement and the ability to hide. They thrive in sandy habitats, with sparse brushy growths with dry Casuarinas and Eucalyptus trees. Most of the time they choose to nest close to freshwater sources. The world population in the wilderness is around 7500 birds. Princess Parrot is a part of a very small family of Australian long-tailed parrots, which all closely resemble a few of the Parakeet species. The first detail you\u2019ll notice is their extremely long and tapered tail, which can easily be longer than their bodies. The adults reach an average length of 18 inches (45 centimeters) and weigh about 3 ounces (90 grams). These birds are slender- and elegant in every aspect of their appearance.

Docile and friendly, they are good pets, especially when kept in pairs as aviary birds.   A pet Red Capped Parrot will love to play and will show their energetic side during playtime. Grass parakeets are certainly a popular and easily recognizable species in Australia. They thrive in the southwestern corner of the continent, from the Moore River, all the way to the coast. Mostly found in sparse growth, Eucalyptus woodlands and mallee, they are also a common sight in certain urban areas, like parks and gardens. They have been introduced into aviculture fairly early \u2013 huge numbers of these parrots were exported, and were successfully bred in England in 1909.

The first success in the breeding of Red Factor Canaries was achieved in Britain in the 1930\u2019s, and these lovely birds soon spread across the rest of Europe and the Americas as a popular and sought after pet. They are usually available through most pet stores and bird shows, as their popularity is still high. Similar to other canary breeds, the Red Factor will grow to about 5.5 inches (14 centimeters) in length. Due to slight variations in the depth of the red color of their feathers, this breed is divided into two sub-classes, the Melanin and the Lipochrome. These were mainly created to distinguish the specific brightness of the coloration in some birds. Although not too robust in size, they are still hardy and strong birds that will do well under most common circumstances. With enough care and attention, they will be easy to breed and look after. More so than the females, the male canaries are sure to produce an intricate and lively weave of melodies. That\u2019s why the males often have a cage of their own, where they can fully express the natural talent that makes them one of the best singing birds. Their melody has a full and natural sound that is always pleasing to hear and is hard to become tiring or a nuisance. Its relaxing tone and subtleness will surely bring a dose of calm into a busy and bustling home. As the name suggests, the Red Factor Canaries sport an overall color that is more than often a deep and burning shade of red. This vivid tone gives this bird a majestic and powerful look. With its striking color, this canary will become a little red spark of liveliness that is sure to bring a smile to your face. The variations of the red color are present, although subtle. Some birds tend to have a lighter shade bordering orange, while others retain a prominent crimson red. The Red Factor canary owes its name to the vibrant and deep red color of its feathers \u2013 a shade guaranteed to leave an impression. Like most other canaries, the Red Factor\u2019s diet will consist mainly of various seeds. Most commercial seed mixes are suitable for this breed as they already contain all the necessary goodies and nutrients. Also, don\u2019t hesitate to add a bit of fresh vegetables to their daily diet, to boost their intake of vitamins and fiber. Their intense red color can be maintained with certain additions to their diet in the form of fresh tomatoes, berries, paprika, and beets. These predominantly red vegetables contain important carotenoid chemicals that will benefit your bird and its vivid color. Canaries are well-rounded birds and will do good in many common conditions. Provided sufficient basic care, they will thrive without any special needs or problems. The main threats to their health are usually damp and drafty places, lousy hygiene, carelessness and improper diet. Keep your eyes peeled for the main indications that something might be wrong. For example, as a lively and singing bird, a canary that is overly silent and shows apathy is sure to be ill. Ruffled feathers, eye sores, and similar signs will tell you your canary needs to see a vet. With enough space and sufficient looking after, your Red Factor Canary will be a hardy, happy bird. These canaries are known to be gentle and lively, without producing too much noise and ruckus. Make sure their cage is roomy and provide them with a perch, a swing or an artificial branch. They don\u2019t require too much interaction, and even when alone, they will sing their lovely melody. Putting two males in a small space can result in territorial fights, so males are often kept on their own.", "facts": " Canary Intensive red Singing bird, Whistler Somewhat social", "tags": "birds for beginners, birds for seniors, birds for singles, canaries, colorbred canaries, low maintenance birds, red canary, Red Factor Canary, small birds, somewhat social birds, "}, "red fronted macaw": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/bird/red-fronted-macaw/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/red-fronted-macaw.png", "name": "Red Fronted Macaw", "type": "bird", "text": "One of the so-called \u201cmini macaws,\u201d the Red fronted macaw is a unique, affectionate and endlessly fun parrot, and truth be told, not at all that \u201cmini.\u201d They can be quite calm and affectionate, being one of the cuddlier breeds of the macaw.

With their mysterious, elegant looks and a lot of unique traits, the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo is charming in every aspect. A lot of people are intrigued by the exotic and magnificent appearance but think that they are hard to raise as pets \u2013 due to their rarity. But the truth is totally different \u2013 Red-tailed Black Cockatoo makes a silly yet calm pet and is not as noisy as other cockatoos. They adapt to most conditions better than any other black cockatoo breed and make best household pets. Let\u2019s find out more about these marvelous parrots. In the mythology of Australia\u2019s Tiwi aborigines, Red-tailed Black Cockatoo accompanies the dead to the heavens. Red-tailed Black Cockatoo is one of the most recognizable parrots of Australia. They leave a strong impression and have always been an important symbol. From sports mascots, postage stamps, to important aboriginal mythologies \u2013 the popularity of these parrots is widespread.  They are found in most parts of Australia, including the dry and arid regions, but also along rivers and in Eucalyptus growths. They adapt easily to harsh conditions and are one of the rare parrots that are nomadic \u2013 moving to different locations with the changing seasons.  Although they are a part of the cockatoo family, the similarities are only basic, and these parrots display a whole variety of unique details.  These, paired with their striking color, will make them easy to spot and identify. The adults reach an average length of 24 inches (60 centimeters) and will weigh up to a 2.20 pounds (a kilogram). Their imposing size makes also means that these cockatoos are strong and will need a lot of free space. Before becoming an owner, make sure you have a spacious home and plenty of room for a feathery friend of this size.  Another unique detail of these parrots is their zygodactyl feet. This means they have two toes in front and two in back, helping them grab things with ease and surprising skill. But the most prominent and impressive detail is their beak. It is huge, stubby, and robust, and can cut open the hardest nuts with ease. Where humans need a hammer, the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo uses its beak.\n We all know that cockatoos have a reputation for being extremely noisy, raucous and difficult to tolerate to some. But these unique members of that family are totally different, and not at all loud. Red-tailed Black Cockatoo owes this to its calm personality. Their natural calls are drawn out \u201ccaws\u201d and \u201ckree\u201d sounds, and they often sound cute and goofy. It is a well-known fact that a happy cockatoo with his needs fulfilled will be much quieter in general. When raised from a young age, these parrots can even learn a few words to repeat. Like most cockatoos, Red-tailed Black Cockatoo is also simple in its coloring, without a lot of fancy details. But they are still totally different from what you\u2019d expect from the species, and incredibly elegant as well. The males are entirely black, with a unique, fluffy crest on the top of the head. They have two red stripes on the tail.  The females are slightly different. While they are also black, they have yellow stripes on the tail, and subtle yellow and orange shades on the cheeks. Even if it is simple, the black color gives these parrots a graceful and noble look that\u2019s rarely seen in the world of parrots. With a few key differences between them, the males and females are easy to tell apart. Today, we have a great variety of commercial seed based mixes that are designed especially for cockatoos. This is the best choice when starting a balanced diet for your pet. But in order to complete it, you will need to add a regular amount of nuts such as almonds, walnuts, and pine nuts. They are a big part of their diet in the wild. They function as tasty treats and sources of important nutrients as well. Make sure that their food is always fresh and the remnants quickly removed to prevent spoiling. Birds of this size are well known for their longevity, durability, and strength. A properly cared for Red-tailed Black Cockatoo can live from 50 to a 100 years, which makes them a lifelong commitment and a companion for more than one family generation. A parrot must have a lot of interaction, plenty of free space, sufficient natural light and a carefully prepared diet. You should also provide them with fresh, untreated branches which they will love to chew and break apart. Their extremely powerful beaks can open a coconut \u2013 and they will require the practice! The Aborigines call these parrots \u201cKarrak\u201d \u2013 which is simply the sound of their natural calls. With enough time to bond, Red-tailed Black Cockatoo can become very affectionate, especially if raised from a young age. They have a few differences in personality when compared to other cockatoos, and are much calmer and friendly. As they are very smart, these birds will surprise you with their inquisitive side, and won\u2019t hesitate to explore and investigate.

With all these good traits comes a fantastic combination of colors that is unique and strikingly beautiful. The Regent parakeet is a one of a kind bird, and a loved pet all over the world. Regent parakeet is a complete package: fun, affectionate, and beautifully colored. These parakeets are widespread throughout the southwestern parts of Australia, where they live in dense shrubland, woodlands, and eucalyptus groves. In the wilderness, they are often observed in small flocks that number from 20 to 100 birds. They are considered one of the best flying birds in Australia, and often zoom around at high speeds in between wooded areas as they search for seeds and water sources. These medium-sized birds reach an average length of about 16 inches (40 centimeters). Unlike some other parakeets, they have rounded chubby bodies and somewhat shorter tails. They also have a distinct beak \u2013 small and sharp, and similar to the Budgerigar parakeet. Males and females can be distinguished by their slight color differences, and with some practice, you will be able to easily tell them apart. These energetic little parrots have a natural tendency to be heard. They are vocal, and besides an occasional loud tweet or chirp, they will often learn a few words to repeat. Besides those, they easily mimic familiar household sounds \u2013 alarms, doorbells, and phones. To train them you can start with whistles and work from there. You\u2019ll be surprised how quickly they learn. But in general, apartment settings might not be the best choice when your parakeet gets chatty. You are bound to fall in love with the graceful look of these parrots. The males have a generally yellow base color, with a lot of details besides. The top of the wings is black with blue patterns and a few red drops here and there. The tail and the flight feathers have a bluish tint.

They are amongst the prettiest pet parrots. Check your local pet stores for the regular seed mixes that are made especially for parakeets. They include a variety of millet seeds, sunflower and oats seeds and a lot of similar goodies. These mixes make a great basic diet which you\u2019ll want to supplement with regular fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Take care to replace fresh water sources on a daily basis as they have a tendency to bathe in every water dish that\u2019s close by. You can also remedy this by regular showers, either in the bathroom or your kitchen sink. Although they might look fragile and small at first glance, these parrots are actually hardy and robust. This is especially true when they are given the necessary attention and care. Remember that Regent parakeets are excellent flyers and require a lot of free space. Besides a spacious cage, they need freedom of movement around the house. They will explore, follow you around and fly as much as they want. This exercise is a basis for good health and happiness. Often called Australia\u2019s best flyers, Regent parakeets have high energy and require the freedom to move as they please. For the most part, the Regent parakeets are docile and affectionate parrots. They will create a bond from an early age, and as they establish trust, they will exhibit the funnier and more energetic side of their personality.

The Rock Parrot, also known as Rock Elegant, can thank the charming looks, and friendly, spirited personality for its popularity. Even though a pet Rock Parrot might require a little bit more care and patience than some of the other parrots of their species, it is more than worth the effort. In return for your love and care, you can expect to get a loyal feathered friend.  These birds thrive best in an aviary setting, where they can enjoy more freedom and a lifestyle closer to their natural one. As their name suggests, these parrots are found in some of the rockier, coastal areas of Southern Australian regions. Their habitat spans from Robe in the south, all the way to Shark Bay in the west. They are almost always near the sea level and choose to breed on small islets offshore. This gives them a good defense against potential predators. They are also seen in coastal shrublands, arid areas, and mangroves. They are a species of least concern, and their numbers are stable. The Neophema genus holds some of the most popular pet parrots in Australia, like the Elegant and Turquoise Parrot. Usually, they share some distinct traits among themselves, which makes them easy to categorize. Rock Parrot is a clear example of its family, with its round, chubby body, a small head, and an even smaller beak, and a  tapered long tail that\u2019s easy to spot. The adults reach an average length of 9 inches (22 centimeters) and can weigh around 2.5 ounces (70 grams). Keep in mind that almost half of their overall length is reserved for the tail. Even though it\u2019s not really big, the Rock Parrot will need plenty of space to be happy. They are susceptible to obesity if not given enough room to roam and explore. An aviary or a bird room are perfect choices for this type of pet bird. The Rock Parrot is not too loud, which makes them a good choice for apartment dwellers worried about noise levels. During flight or feeding time, they can repeat their natural call, consisting of various pitched chirps and tweet sounds. But in general, they are very easy to tolerate and work both as apartment and house pets.  Even if many owners around the world favor parrots that flaunt as many exotic colors as possible, the colorfulness is not always the measure of a parrot\u2019s beauty. Sometimes, there is a graceful charm in simplicity and subtle colors. And the Rock Parrot shows us precisely that. The body is almost entirely olive green, with brown overtones. The lower body and the chest are lighter and yellow. The wing tips and tail are streaked with black and dark blue. Above the beak, there is a single blue band which gives a distinct detail of their own. One look at the Rock Parrot will tell you that their simplicity does not prevent them from being some of the most charming and pretty birds in Australia. The subtle and simple coloring of the Rock Parrot has a certain graceful charm. In the wild, these parrots are known as ground feeding and have evolved to a variety of grass seeds and fruits. In captivity, they will need a balanced diet which is best compared to that of the other members of the Neophema family. Small seed mixes, fresh fruits and veggies, and an occasional parrot treat will be a great start. Just make sure to feed the right amounts, as you don\u2019t want your chubby parrot to become obese.  Their lifespan is around 12 years, but with good care and (especially) good diet, a Rock Parrot could live even longer than that. The impressive ability to adapt allowed the Rock Parrot to thrive in a harsh natural habitat. Even so, they\u2019ll need to adjust to household conditions first. Besides a spacious cage, they need freedom of movement around the rooms. Obesity is a real threat for these birds and it\u2019s best counteracted with a balanced diet and plenty of exercise. Rock Parrots are explorers and goofs. If they lack activity, it will be the main cause for potential weight problems. These unusual parrots are quite smart and will become inquisitive little explorers if allowed. Often, they will also show their cuddly and affectionate side, so don\u2019t deprive them of the much-needed head scratches and gentle petting. Even if the Rock Parrot is docile and amiable by nature, they\u2019ll still need to be socialized. Social interaction with their owner is an absolute must, as it ensures that they stay happy and friendly pets. With a bit of an effort put into their care and plenty of love, a Rock Parrot will be a great and rewarding pet bird for singles and families alike.", "facts": " Parrot Olive green Vocal, Natural calls, Moderately Noisy, Whistler Social, Smart, Fun, Affectionate, Docile, Friendly", "tags": "Australian Grass Parakeets, pet birds for apartment, pet birds for aviary, pet birds for experienced owners, pet birds for house, pet birds for seniors, pet birds for singles, Rock elegant, Rock parrot, "}, "rose breasted cockatoo": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/bird/rose-breasted-cockatoo/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rose-breasted-cockatoo.jpg", "name": "Rose Breasted Cockatoo", "type": "bird", "text": "The Rose Breasted Cockatoo is most commonly known as the Galah, and it\u2019s one of the most unique, widespread and popular parrots in the large and diverse cockatoo family. This bird stands apart with its distinct and beautiful plumage, as well as with its fun and lovable temperament. Although very peculiar, this parrot is one of the most common sights in its natural home and has become a popular and loved choice for a pet parrot. Let\u2019s meet the Galah! Galahs are unique and lovely members of the cockatoo family.  There\u2019s so much to love about them. Galahs are native to almost the entire Australian continent, with only a few small regions as an exception. With such an impressive distribution, the populations of these parrots are steadily rising and have adapted to live in most conditions. They can be seen in the wilderness but in major Australian cities as well. In Melbourne, Perth, and Adelaide, small flocks of Galah cockatoos are a loved and common sight.   These bright and lively cockatoos are unique but still share a plenty of traits with the rest of their family.

The adults reach an average length of 14 inches (35 centimeters) and can weigh up to 12 ounces (350 grams). Although seemingly identical, the males and females have one tiny difference \u2013 the color of the irises!  The first thing you learn about cockatoos is that they simply love to be loud- they are nagging talkers with a big appetite for noisy behavior. Galahs, on the other hand, can be significantly quieter than their relatives, owing to their shyer demeanor. But they\u2019ll still love to talk and mimic human speech in their own peculiar and endlessly funny way. These intelligent parrots never fail to surprise you with a new word or a new way of getting what they want. Due to their possible noisiness, Galahs and cockatoos, in general, are not the best choice for apartment birds.  The best feature of the Rose Breasted Cockatoo and the thing that sets them apart is their splendid and beautiful plumage. With a majority of common pet cockatiels being white, the Galah comes as a wonderful exception. The wings, back, and the rump are a silver gray, while the breast, belly, and face are a vivid bright pink. Their distinct crest is less prominent when flaccid, and is colored in a pale, light pink, with darker feathers hidden beneath. This graceful and lovely combination of simple colors sets the Galah apart as one of the prettiest cockatoos and parrots in Australia.   One of Australia\u2019s prettiest birds, the Rose Breasted Cockatoo is best known for its bright and lively pink plumage. In the wild, the Rose Breasted cockatoos can be spotted both as ground foragers and on the trees. They have a varied diet of grass seeds, nuts, flower buds, and insects. As a pet, they have the option of a commercial seed based mix designed just for cockatoos. As an added source of advanced vitamins, you should introduce fresh common fruits and green vegetables. Cockatoos enjoy an occasional bath and they should be encouraged \u2013 they help prevent dangerous skin and feather diseases which can happen to most parrots. As such a popular and common bird all over the entire Australian continent, there\u2019s no doubt that the Galah is a durable and extremely adaptable bird. While rapid European settlement critically endangered some parrots, the Rose Breasted Cockatoo thrived and adapted, which resulted in their abundance and increased population. As pets, they are also hardy and healthy. They have a long lifespan of up to 80 years, which will have little troubles if you give them enough of good care and looking after. Rose Breasted Cockatoo has a long lifespan of 80 years \u2013 these parrots are lifetime companions. These affectionate and fun parrots have a strong tendency to create deep bonds with their owners. As you get to know your pet and its personality, it might just be that you meet your new and lifelong friend. A Galah is energetic and full of silly behavior like most other cockatoos, but it is also quite affectionate. It\u2019s not unusual for a Rose Breasted Cockatoo to be quiet in their play or to cuddle up to their owner in search of some scratches.

Wild populations can be seen even in London. These parrots live in one of the largest areas, which makes them unique in the parrot world. This wide range separates this species into two slightly different breeds \u2013 the Indian and the African. Their habitats include countries such as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Burma, and in Africa \u2013 Senegal, Sudan, Uganda, Egypt, and many others. But that\u2019s not all \u2013 they have been introduced into many of the big cities around the world. Escaped birds created small colonies and thriving populations. They are a common sight in Britain, Belgium, France, Japan, and Germany. Most breeds of closely related parakeets share the same physical traits, differing only in their coloring. With its distinct features and patterns, the Rose Ringed Parakeet is easy to recognize and it stands apart as one of the most popular parrot breeds. The adults reach an average length of 16 inches (40 centimeters) and can weigh about 5 ounces (150 grams). Remember that parakeets have exceptionally long tail feathers. This, and their large wingspan will require a large and roomy cage or even an aviary. You need to ensure plenty of free room and exercise. Rose Ringed Parakeet is quite vocal and loves to express itself with natural calls. Luckily, these calls are not often piercing or intolerable \u2013 they consist of distinct high pitched calls and shrieks, which are often repeated.

Without a doubt, the Rose Ringed Parakeet is a parrot you\u2019ll fall in love with- at first sight. Remember that males have much more details on the head than the females. This sets them apart and makes the differences obvious. Their wilderness diet is limited and consists mainly of grass seeds, small fruits, and berries, insects, and crops. For a pet parakeet, you want to imitate this with a commercial small seed mix that includes all the important contents such as millet, maize, spray, canary seeds and similar. They will also love some finely chopped fresh fruits and vegetables, which also act as a source of much-needed vitamins. Since cleanliness is a big priority, a shower, a spraying bottle or a small bathing dish is a good choice and will work fine and keep the hygiene in order.

This makes them very tough and they adapted easily to most of the world\u2019s surroundings.

Beautifully colored, intelligent and with a strong attitude, Rosella Parakeets are exotic and sought after pet bird, even though they can be quite willful and feisty at times. Certainly one of Australia\u2019s most colorful and intriguing birds, the Rosellas remain an iconic sight and a unique pet bird. While undoubtedly stunning, Rosellas have a strong and feisty attitude. You should know that they can be a handful sometimes. Discovered as early as 1790\u2019s by English zoologists, Rosella Parakeets inhabit a large area in Eastern Australia and Tasmania. They like to nest in lightly wooded areas, shrubbery, and bushland. Since then, large feral populations were established in New Zealand. Their flocks number as much as 100 birds, and they\u2019re known as very territorial and quarrelsome in the wild. A little bit of this grumpy personality remained even in captivity, as a pet bird. Rosella Parakeet is a medium-sized bird, as their length can reach up to 12 inches (30 centimeters). However, a good portion of this length is taken by their long tails, similar to other parakeet breeds. The body is stocky, well built, with a small, round head and a distinctive blunt beak. While males and females are strikingly similar, some slight color differences will set the female sex apart. These energetic, lively birds love to make their voice heard. Talking and mimicry are present, but not a strong side of Rosella Parakeet. What they like though, is to be loud, with a full arsenal of whistles, caws, and melodies. Most of the time these repetitive, but melodic tunes are used to express their needs or anything that is not according to their wishes. They\u2019re not always noisy though, and during certain times will be moderate and quiet. Still, their loud nature makes them a poor choice for apartment living. The biggest pride of these feisty little parrots is their vibrant and colorful plumage. White cheeks, red head, yellow belly and greenish rump \u2013 the combinations are wild, exotic and endlessly fascinating. The back and wings are intricate and detailed, with yellow-black patterns and blue undertones. It is without a doubt an exciting and vivid bird and will be the central attraction in your home. Some sub-species, like the Crimson Rosella, are equally radiant, with different tones, like dark red and blue combinations. Rosella Parakeet\u2019s plumage is a real whirlwind of colors. The vibrant and bright feathers are bound to impress you! In the wild, Rosella Parakeets will feed mainly on seeds, fruits, and flower buds, holding the food in their little feet as they eat. As a pet, most of this diet is taken care of by the usual store-bought seed mixes. What you\u2019ll want to do, though, is supplement their diet with fresh fruits and green vegetables. Rosella Parakeet will also appreciate some cooked chicken or rice from time to time. Don\u2019t forget to provide them with fresh water for drinking and bathing. Rosellas are hardy and renowned for their resilient nature. The main things to keep in mind is their hygiene, which should not be neglected, and their need to move around. They are very energetic and inquisitive, and keeping them closed in a cramped cage will lead to problems with their health. Ensure a large cage and enough time daily for flying and exploring the house. With these basic needs taken care of, your pet will be pleased and in peak health. Resilient and healthy, the Rosellas are easy to look after. Just keep in mind their energetic, exploring personalities. It\u2019s no secret that these parrots are one of the most stubborn and bossy birds around. When the mood is not centered on playing and peaceful cuddling, it will be turned into a loud proclamation of your pet\u2019s grumpy and feisty mood.

These robust, loud and unique parrots have strong personalities, and you\u2019ll certainly find that out for yourself. With their vibrant, bubbly and sociable behavior, these parrots can prove to be a challenging pet. That\u2019s why they will fit perfectly with owners who have a friendly and energetic personality as well. But with just a little bit of patience and understanding, every owner can and will fall in love with these big goofs. Let\u2019s meet the Sulphur Crested Cockatoo. These cockatoos are very intelligent and energetic. They will often surprise you with their constructive behavior. One of the iconic breeds of Australia, these parrots are found in large areas in north and east of this continent. Sulphur Crested Cockatoo is also found all over the island of New Guinea and the numerous small islands nearby. They easily adapt and thrive in a variety of different areas, mostly dense forests, mangrove fields, savanna, urban surroundings, and agricultural plantations. In certain urban areas, they are really numerous and invasive, that they are considered as pests. Seeing one in your suburban garden in Sydney shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Although their numbers are stable in the wild, some areas still show a significant decrease, mostly due to continued illegal trapping and selling on the black market. Most of the popular cockatoo breeds are similar in their appearance. They are easily recognized but easily mixed up as well. The best way to know the difference is by their colorful crests. The adults reach an average length of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) and can weigh from 2 to 2.2 pounds (900 to 1000 grams). Needless to say, these are robust and large parrots and an aviary will be the best surrounding for them. A very large and roomy cage could work as well.  But you will quickly realize that a lot of time outside of the cage will be the best solution for a Sulphur Crested Cockatoo.  The first thing that comes prospective cockatoo owners want to know about is how noisy these parrots actually are. These big parrots are very vocal and can sometimes be difficult to endure. They love to mimic human speech in a goofy, slurred way and very loudly too. But this doesn\u2019t occur all the time. It is mostly a way to express boredom, hunger or a wish to play. With a bit of patience, you can get used to it as you get to know your pet better. Nonetheless, a Sulphur Crested Cockatoo is not an apartment pet. A roomy house is the only fitting surrounding for this parrot.  A lot of popular cockatoo breeds are lacking in variety and exotic colors that many other big parrots have. This might be an issue for some owners who prefer variety in color. These parrots are entirely white. Although this is simple it still gives them a feeling of elegance that few birds possess. They have subtle, pale yellow shades on the tail, and their iconic crest is bright yellow \u2013 a unique detail that provides a balanced contrast. Sulphur Crested Cockatoo is a pretty and charming parrot. A cockatoo\u2019s crest signifies its mood. Bored, hungry, excited or scared? Pay attention to its crest. In the wild, these parrots thrive on a variety of seeds, fruits, insects and crops. This is a carefully selected natural diet that offers all the necessary nutrients for these large birds. For your Sulphur Crested Cockatoo, you should begin with a commercial seed mix, usually designed for cockatoos. It contains all the important seeds such as millet, safflower, canary, and oats. Supplement this with a lot of fresh green vegetables and fruit and you will have a balanced and nutritious diet. It is a very important part of the overall care for your pet. Robust, large and hardy, these parrots are rarely ill. With enough good care and attention, you will have no problem caring for your pet cockatoo. One thing to take care of, though, is exercise. Large parrots can become obese and this is no good. Plenty of playing and exercising during the day will keep this at bay. The other important aspect is hygiene.  Cockatoos can suffer from \u201cpsittacine feather and beak disease\u201d which makes them lose all their feathers. This can be prevented with regular showers and a healthy lifestyle. Did you know that the oldest cockatoo was 120 years old? He was very intelligent and a real celebrity in one of South Sydney\u2019s pubs. Cockatoos are a whirlwind of fun. Be prepared to enrich your life and your home with an energetic, smart parrot whose favorite thing is having a good time. While their noisy and energetic behavior might take a little getting used to, you will still be charmed by all the good-natured fun and silliness of a Sulphur Crested Cockatoo. Besides that, they can be quite cuddly when they like, and they have an affinity for cuddles and scratches. And with their long lifespan that can go well over 65 years, you will have a companion, friend, and a family member for a lifetime.", "facts": " Cockatoo White Vocal, Loud, Mimics, Talkative, Noisy Social, Fun, Friendly, Cuddly, Affectionate, Playful", "tags": "cockatoo pets, companion pet birds, goofy pet birds, large parrots, long-lived pet birds, pet birds for house, Sulphur-crested cockatoo, talkative pet birds, "}, "sun conure": {"page_url": "https://www.petguide.com/breeds/bird/sun-conure/", "image_url": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sun-conure.jpg", "name": "Sun Conure", "type": "bird", "text": "There are a couple of reasons why the Sun Conure is a highly popular pet bird.

They prefer these tropical regions \u2013 the coastal, savannah forests \u2013 as their nesting places, choosing palm groves and blooming trees as their home.

Cuttlebones and commercial mineral blocks both serve as a great source of vitamins and a chance for your pet to work on their beak. A source of fresh water must be changed regularly. Stoutness and good health are a significant advantage for Sun Conures. They are known for their ability to adapt and thrive in most common conditions. To ensure a long life free of sickness, pay attention to avoid some regular issues like draft, cold, neglected hygiene and lack of space and exercise. These parrots are energetic and sociable, which means they will require a lot of space outside of the cage, playing around the house.

Loved as a pet from early 19th century, the Turquoise Parrot is again becoming a very popular choice. Small, playful and gentle, these charismatic birds have a lot to offer and are known as a great pet with unique traits. They are one of Australia\u2019s protected breeds. Finding one on the pet markets should be no problem, and if you do, don\u2019t hesitate \u2013 the Turquoise Parrot might just be the pet you\u2019ve always wanted.  The ease of care, lovable temperament and charming looks all make the Turquoise Parrot a wonderful choice for a pet. One of earliest breeds to be spotted by English colonists in Australia, the Turquoise Parrot was first described in 1792. From then on, its story as a pet bird began. They are found natively in the east of Australia, through Queensland and Victoria. Thriving at altitudes of up to 700 meters, they live in grasslands and scrub light woodlands and forest edges. They are one of the so-called grass parakeets, and their flocks are spotted feeding on the ground and in the grasses. They are a breed of least-concern and their numbers in the wild are reaching 20,000 birds. Similar to the other birds of their family, Turquoise Parrot has some easily distinguished physical traits, mainly the small head and a very long tail. But similarities end there. This breed stands completely apart with its wonderful and unique appearance. The adults reach an average length of 8 inches (20 centimeters) and will weigh on average between a little under 2 ounces (50 grams). One thing to keep in mind when your pet is as small and energetic as the Turquoise Parrot is their need for space. Please ensure a lot of room for their activities, but more importantly an opportunity to fly around the home. This is the central aspect of their nature and they need it to thrive. Birds that are as small as the grass parakeets, usually have no talent for talking and mimicry. More often than not, that trait is reserved for the big birds. But what they do have are vocal talents \u2013 their natural calls are often pleasing to hear, with soft tweets and chirps unique to them.  They could be acceptable for an apartment pet, but a house is still the best choice, due to the abundance of room. When they settle in the evening, they will sing in a soft murmuring song. A lovely lullaby of sorts! Turquoise Parrot has much more colors to flaunt than their name would suggest. With a lot of different patches and bright hues, they are a real sight. There are very subtle differences between males and females and it takes a good eye to spot them. The body is mostly full of colors, with the back being a dim green, and the chest and belly bright yellow, speckled with orange. The face of the males is bright, sky blue, and that color is repeated on the wing tips. Blue, green and yellow are all mixed in the long tail. The females are similar but with much paler colors and subtler details. However you look at it, these small parrots are certainly big charmers and one of the more unique birds out there. Several artificial colors have been created over the years in aviculture. The most popular is an all yellow variant. In their natural surroundings, these little parakeets will thrive on a balanced diet of seeds, fruits, insects and grasses. The logical first step when starting your pet\u2019s diet is the commercial seed mix specifically designed for smaller breeds like budgies or other parakeets. These mixes ensure a healthy combination of millet, oats, sunflower seeds, and other similar goodies. In order to provide needed vitamins, you will need to supplement the diet with a reasonable dose of fresh fruits and vegetables, such as oranges, apples, pears, cabbage, and carrots.  Additionally, you should know that every Turquoise Parrot loves to bathe. Provide regular baths and offer small bathing dishes. To much surprise, these tiny parrots are tough and hardy. Of course, they had to adapt to life in arid conditions in Australia, so no wonder they became resilient. When given optimal living conditions and basic care, the Turquoise Parrot will be a  thriving and healthy pet parrot. As you will quickly notice, their energy and playful behavior are one of the main traits. They need to be taken into account, and a lot of free space provided as an outlet for that spiritedness. Offer daily exercise around the home and outside of the cage. Keeping these birds together with larger, territorial parrots is not recommended. An injury may occur. Lively and full of personality, the Turquoise Parrot is quite the pocket-sized charmer. They can deeply bond with their owner, especially when kept from a young, juvenile period, and regularly interacted with. Keep in mind \u2013 these are sensitive parrots when it comes to company.

Their popularity goes back as far as seventh century AD, where they were cherished pets on the courts of China\u2019s Tang dynasty.

They quickly became widespread and popular pet birds, which remains unchanged: these days, they\u2019re often the stars of viral cute parrot videos! The Umbrella Cockatoos have been cherished for centuries. They are loving and affectionate birds, with many unique features. The home of these parrots is reserved for only a few islands in the northern cluster of Maluku islands, in Indonesia. Umbrella Cockatoos enjoy living in lowland tropical forests and mangroves in small flocks. Even though this bird is common as a pet, in the wild its numbers are declining, causing it to become an endangered species. White Cockatoos are large and graceful birds. The adults can reach a length of around 18 inches (46 centimeters) and weigh up to 1.8 lbs (800 grams), making them one of the largest in the cockatoo family. Like some other parrots, Umbrella Cockatoo has a unique feature \u2013 the zygodactyls feet. This means that they have two toes forward and two toes backward, allowing them to grasp objects and hold onto branches with relative ease. They also like to hold their food in one foot and nibble on it. The most interesting detail, though, is their radiant crest, which inspired their name. When excited, your pet will spread the crest on top of its head, which resembles a large fan or an umbrella.

With their friendly personalities and unusual appearance,  these parrots have no trouble capturing the heart of every new owner. Big, smart and goofy, the Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo is so much fun to hang out with. Although they require plenty of space to be happy, this doesn\u2019t stop them from being rewarding pet parrots. Let\u2019s learn more about one of South Australia\u2019s most beloved birds.  Did you know that these cockatoos can feed like woodpeckers, clinging to trees as they search for insects? Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo is found in a few smaller regions in southern Australia. These include parts of Queensland and New South Wales, but also Tasmania and Kangaroo Islands. Mainly present in coastal areas and further inland, they can be seen even at altitudes of up to 2000 meters. They thrive in Eucalyptus woodland, high rainforests, plantations, and interior heathland. Most of the time they are spotted in large flocks of 300 birds, making for an impressive and noisy sight.  After the introduction of Australia\u2019s strict laws that protect wildlife, the populations of these cockatoos have been stable and not critically threatened.  The members of the small family of Calyptorhynchus \u2013 the Black Cockatoos, share a lot of similar physical traits. One of the features they share is a short, stubby crest that really looks like tousled hair. This crest is considerably smaller than what we see in most other breeds. Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo takes the top spot when it comes to their size, as the adults reach an average length of impressive 26 inches (67 centimeters). These robust birds will weigh around 2 pounds (900 grams) on average. Naturally, a bird of this size needs a lot of exercise. Lethargy and obesity are all very real threats, so a spacious aviary would be the best choice for this pet.  With some pet owners in areas where climate allows it, outdoor aviaries are becoming a popular choice. They give your pet cockatoo a natural experience, but a bird room will do just fine, as well.  The Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo is not as vocal as other members of its family. Their natural calls can be loud but are heard sparsely throughout the day. Caws and short screeches, as well as their size, can make these birds difficult to keep in an apartment setting. Keep in mind that a noise level is directly influenced by how happy your pet is. Hungry, lonesome, sick and neglected birds can be much noisier than they naturally are. Also, all black cockatoos, especially in outdoor aviaries, can be considerably vocal when the full moon is out. Another unique quirk of these unique birds! The solid color of a parrot\u2019s plumage doesn\u2019t make them ugly or uninspiring. On the contrary, this unique appearance gives them an undeniable dose of elegance and charm. Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo is also one of the rare cockatoo breeds that display sexual dimorphism \u2013 meaning that the males and females are different. Both sexes are almost entirely black, with slight brown tinges throughout. Their cheeks have large circular patches of yellow color, giving them a blushing, cute look. The chest feathers are bordered with slight yellow edges. Males have a black beak, while for the females it is pale, horn colored. These gorgeous birds give us all the proof we need that a lack of vibrant and tropical colors can still make a parrot look out-of-this-world beautiful. Pay attention to the color of the beak. It will help you identify males and females with ease. Another unique trait of these large cockatoos is their diet. One of the rare breeds to feed primarily on grubs that live in wood, Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo will feed in a woodpecker stance, searching the trees for some tasty insects. As a pet, their diet should be based on a seed or pellet mix designed for cockatoos. This offers a good base with the important nutrients, and it can be easily added upon. Mealworms are one of the favorite treats and a source of important protein. Keep in mind that these large birds love and need baths. An occasional shower will benefit them and serve as a rewarding treat. These are one of the long-lived cockatoo species, and they have a robust built that is the chief cause of their good health. You should count on a lifelong friendship that can span for more than 50 years. But remember, to ensure a lengthy, healthy life, you need to provide good care and conditions. Exercise and attention are mandatory, as well as a balanced diet. To minimize the risk of obesity and ensure a well-adapted parrot, you should strongly consider keeping your Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo pet in a spacious aviary or a bird room. This gives them the freedom they need and deserve. Outdoor aviaries are a popular choice for these cockatoos. They ensure plenty of space and a life close to that in the wild. The down-to-earth, laid-back behavior of the Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo is very different from the highly energetic behavior that we\u2019re used to from other cockatoos. They can tolerate other parrots in their vicinity, but when the breeding season comes they will require a space of their own. It is a known fact that these large parrots are very intelligent. This means that your Yellow Tailed Black Cockatoo will use every chance to explore the house and investigate any new thing in their surroundings.
