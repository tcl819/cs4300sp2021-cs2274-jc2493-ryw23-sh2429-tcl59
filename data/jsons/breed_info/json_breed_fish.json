True acaras are the larger of the two, growing between 6 and 12 inches in length while other Acaras grow no larger than 6 inches. Most acara cichlids are somewhat aggressive and territorial and they have a tendency to eat smaller fish. Acaras come in a wide range of colors including blue, green, brown, gray and black. Fishes belonging to the Acara family are found only in the tropical regions of Central and South America. Different species of Acara Cichlid can be found in both still waters and turbulent waters, including clear flowing streams and tributaries. Acaras come in a wide range of colors including blue, green, brown, gray and black. Some Acaras exhibit horizontal stripes, broken lines, or patches of color on the body, often with a dark lateral stripe running through the eye and along the midsection of the fish. While each species is different, most Acaras are hardy fish that can adapt to a range of different water conditions \u2013 this makes them moderately easy to care for. Acaras tend to prefer warm water with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5 and a water hardness between 2 and 18 dH. The ideal temperature range for Acaras is 72\u00b0F to 79\u00b0F. Acara tanks should be kept open and free from large d\u00e9cor items in the center to allow for free swimming. These fish also appreciate rock caves and other hiding places. Most Acaras are hardy fish that can adapt to a range of different water conditions. Acaras will eat a wide variety of foods including live foods as well as flakes and pellets. In the wild, Acaras feed on small crustaceans, insect larvae, and small fishes. In the home aquarium, these fish should be offered a combination of flakes, pellets, meaty foods, and carnivore pellets. Different species of Acara Cichlids exhibit different breeding habits, though all Acaras are egg layers. Some species divide into monogamous pairs and lay their eggs on flat rocks while others scatter their eggs on plants. Some Acara Cichlids are mouth brooders, incubating the eggs in their mouths until hatching.

Most species are also fairly hardy and are perfect for both novice and experienced aquarists. They can be a bit more aggressive than your average tropical fishes, though, so not all types of African cichlids will get along well with other tank mates. That said, it is very important that aquarists carefully research each species\u2019 specific requirements before attempting to raise them.Whether it\u2019s which other species they tolerate or what food they need to eat, it\u2019s crucial to get all the details right if you want your cichlids to thrive.  To find out if any of the varieties of African cichlids is the right choice for your aquarium, read on.  African cichlids are considered to be one of the most diverse, intelligent, active and colorful families of freshwater fish in the modern aquarium hobby. As their name suggests, most species of African cichlids originate from one of Africa\u2019s three great lakes \u2013 Lake Malawi, Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika. Even though they make up just one branch of the enormous and diverse Cichlid family, these freshwater fishes come in many different types and varieties. Some African cichlids thrive in the depths of the Lake Malawi, finding their home 490 feet under the surface, whereas others prefer shallow waters.  African cichlids come in a dazzling array of colors ranging from red, blue, orange, yellow, green, brown and black. In fact, it\u2019s precisely their stunning variety of vibrant colors what makes this family of fishes so popular among aquarium owners.  Colors of African cichlid differ between sexes, and males will be much more flamboyant than females, who tend to be a bit toned down in comparison. The vibrancy of the colors of your fish will also be a good indicator of their health. Fishes whose colors are dull or seem faded are highly likely to be sick, as healthy African cichlid has bright scales.   Despite their highly exotic appearance, African cichlids are actually one of the hardiest families of freshwater fish. In fact, they are resistant to most diseases that plague other species of freshwater fish and can easily live for 5 to 8 years in a well maintained aquarium. Whenever you\u2019re introducing a new species of fish into your tank, you should pay attention to what their original habitat was and try to recreate the conditions as closely as possible. Of course, in the majority (if not all) cases, the fish you\u2019ll be keeping are bred in captivity, but it doesn\u2019t mean that their needs are not the same as they are in the wild. There are many different types of African cichlids, but, in general, they all have similar requirements.  The aquarium in which these fishes live should be spacious enough. Most varieties are around 6 inches in size when fully mature, and will do well in a 20 gallon tank. Those who are slightly bigger and grow to be about 8 inches in size should have a 30 gallon tank. As for the water inside your aquarium setup, these fishes need moving water to be happy. For some species, the current generated from the filter will be enough, but those like Lionhead Cichlid or Nigerian Green Cichlid will need a water or an air pump to mimic the stronger currents of their river habitat. The water in the great African lakes is actually quite hard, and these cichlids will prefer it to soft water. The ph of the water should be between 7.8 and 8.5, depending on the specific variety you have. Naturally, the temperature of water in their place of origin is warm, so you\u2019ll have to make sure the heater keeps water toasty at a temp of 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29.4 degrees Celsius). In their natural habitat, African cichlids dwell in lake bottoms littered with vast amounts of rock and rubble. It is advisable to recreate this type of atmosphere in the aquarium. Not only will this help most species feel at home, but it will also minimize territorial fights because each fish will have an ample number of hiding places to choose from to guard as its own. They will also like to dig at the bottom of the tank, so it\u2019s advisable you choose a fine aquarium substrate that won\u2019t cause injury. Another important thing to keep in mind when keeping African cichlids is that they are aggressive and territorial. For this reason, they are best kept in aquariums with their own kind as they can often harass and sometimes kill easier going species of fish. When matching various species in an aquarium it is important to carefully research their specific water requirements, temperaments and regions beforehand. A general rule of thumb is not to mix fish from different regions of Africa. African cichlids are gregarious eaters and will readily devour most types of foods. They should be fed on a varied diet consisting of both frozen and processed foods like pellets, brine shrimp, bloodworms and beef heart. Despite their highly exotic appearance, African cichlids are actually one of the hardiest families of freshwater fish. The various species of African cichlids have vastly different and extremely interesting breeding habits. For the most part they are parental and zealously guard their eggs and young from other fish.

Angelfish are a relatively hardy species of fish and can live for 5-10 years when provided with adequate care and excellent water conditions. They do not require large open swimming spaces and do best in aquariums planted heavily with reedy plants. They should be housed in large aquariums with sufficient height to accommodate their tall body shapes. Angelfish are diurnal and prefer dimly lit aquariums with ample hiding spaces. Although they are generally considered a peaceful species of fish, they can sometimes be territorial. It is advisable to raise them in a group of 6 or more as this often dulls their aggression and bullying. They are also known fin nippers and can harass species of fish with long flowing fins like Betta splendens, guppies and goldfish.

They have distensible jaws and stomachs which enable them to prey on fish up to twice their size. Anglerfish are a family of predatory fish consisting of over 200 separate species. Anglerfish originate in the North Atlantic Ocean. Anglerfish come in subdued shades of red, yellow, tan, orange and black. Choosing tank mates for an anglerfish is a tricky business because it can prey on fish up to twice its size, and because it can also be injured by larger more aggressive fish. There are plenty of reports of anglerfish that have lost their illicium after being housed with puffers and triggers. For this reason, most aquarists prefer to keep these fish alone or in species aquariums. These fish are not active swimmers and spend most of their time lounging at the bottom of the aquarium. They are reef safe and also prefer aquariums with plenty of rock and coral cover which they can blend in with. They also produce a significant amount of waste, so filtration is an important consideration in their aquariums. Anglerfish thrive when fed on live foods such as small fish, brine shrimp and ghost shrimp. They can also be trained to accept frozen foods like krill, mysis shrimp and chunks of fish. This can be done by attaching the food to a stick and wiggling it in front of the fish to stimulate its prey drive. Anglerfish are not active swimmers and spend most of their time lounging at the bottom of the aquarium. It is unheard of for anglerfish to breed in the home aquarium. In their natural habitat, they display extremely intriguing reproductive behavior where the male attaches itself to the body of the female. When this happens, the male will excrete a special enzyme onto the body of the female and literally blend its body into hers, sharing her blood system. The male will also gradually shrink in size to enable the female to function without a great deal of hindrance to her movements.

It is extremely important to research specific species of anthias before attempting to raise them because the more timid species can sometimes become stressed out by more active tank mates. In fact, it is not unheard of for these fish to die of stress caused by the swimming movements of non-aggressive but active tank mates. Although they are known to swim in large shoals in the wild, it is hard to replicate this behavior in the home aquarium. This is because of their extremely complex social hierarchy systems.

They are considered a Jurassic era species and have been around for over a 100 million years. The Arowana has a bony head and a long, powerful body. Their bodies are also covered in large, heavy scales with a mosaic pattern of canals. They are sometimes referred to as \u201cbonytounges\u201d because of the toothed bone at the bottom of their mouth which bites against the roof of their mouth. Arowana are also characterized by two, darkly colored, barbells that extend from its bottom lips. These barbells are often delicate, and can easily be damaged by rough handling. Due to their demanding nature and sheer size, the task of raising this fish should only be attempted by dedicated and experienced aquarist. They are also one of the most expensive species of aquarium fish, with some adult specimens commanding tens of thousands of dollars. In fact, a platinum arowana keeps the record as the most expensive aquarium fish ever sold when its price tag reached a whopping $400,000. The high value of these fish makes them very coveted among aquarists, but they\u2019re not easy to come across. Arowanas are microchipped before they reach maturity to ensure the buyer knows that they were bred in captivity. In the wild, arowanas are considered endangered so the aquarium species all come from Asian arowana farms. Sometimes referred to as the dragon fish, arowanas are one of the most beautiful and most fascinating species of fish in the aquarium trade. Arowanas are ancient fish with millions of years of history. Currently, there are about 10 arowana species that are kept as aquarium fish, and they originated either in South America, Australia, Asia, or Africa. In fact, they are the only freshwater species that can be originally found both in the waters of Asia and Australia.  The most exotic and colorful species is from southeast Asia, the aptly named Asian Arowana or dragonfish. The silver arowana comes from South America, and it is native to the Amazon, Essequibo and Oyapock basins. This type of arowana is the least expensive one, as they are least restricted to import and export. Black arowana is also a South American species. Lastly, there are the rare Australian arowanas, also known as southern or gulf saratoga. They are native to the Fitzroy river system and the Gulf of Carpentaria drainage system. Australian arowanas are not considered endangered.  The sleek, metallic scales of arowanas are one of the things aquarists most like about them. There are at least ten different aquarium arowana species, and the color of their scales will largely depend on the species they belong to. For instance, the Asian arowanas are, without a doubt, the most vivid and vibrant of the family. Some of the colors of these fishes are green, blue and gold, silver, and the popular blood red. The colors start out a bit duller in their juvenile years and intensify and transform when the fish matures.  Their cousins, silver and black arowanas from South American waters keep their hues throughout their life. The Australian arowanas are mostly dull in coloring, leaning towards darkish grey and brown tones, although they can sometimes have spotted scales.  Arowana are one of the largest growing species of aquarium fish and can sometimes reach lengths of over 4 feet. For this reason it is recommended that they are raised in extremely large tanks of over 250 gallons or large outdoor ponds. Arowanas prefer aquariums with both large open swimming spaces and sufficient hiding spots. They mostly swim near the surface region of the aquarium and are incredibly powerful jumpers. Arowanas in the wild have been spotted jumping 10 feet or more to capture insects and birds. For this reason it is crucial that the arowana\u2019s aquarium be tightly covered with a heavy lid. Arowana are extremely heavy eaters and tend to produce a lot of waste. Therefore it is crucial that aquarists pay careful attention to their water conditions and not let the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate content of the arowana aquarium reach hazardous levels. Water changes of up to 20% are recommended twice a week. Additionally, their tank will require a powerful filtration system. Most arowana owners that keep these fishes in a tank decide on getting a sump filter, or a powerful, high-end canister filter. A well cared for arowana will often live for up to 15 to 20 years. This is one of the reasons why these fishes are a bad choice for inexperienced aquarists- they require a lot of care and commitment and often for two decades. Keeping arowanas is a serious commitment, both financial and effort-wise, as these striking specimens will need a lot of space and care to thrive in a home setup. However, even though their size dictates special care requirements, when it comes to the water itself, they are not overly finicky. Most arowanas can adapt to a variety of conditions, but making sure that the water pH value and temperature are close to their preferred values will only increase their longevity and quality of life. These imposing fishes do best in well filtered, soft, and slightly acidic freshwater. The pH value of 6.4 to 6.8 is ideal for them. As for the temperature, they are usually happy when it\u2019s around 28 degrees Celsius in the tank. While younger arowana prefer to be kept in fairly large groups of 6 or more, they can turn extremely territorial and aggressive towards one other when reaching maturity. For this reason most arowana keepers prefer to keep arowanas alone. However, adult arowanas can be kept in large groups of 6 or more when raised in a large aquarium or pond with sufficient room. Arowanas are extremely predatory and should not be kept with smaller sized fish. They can be kept in community tanks with large, non-aggressive species like knifefish, pacus, oscars, plecostomus, jaguar cichlids, green terrors, gars, tinfoil barbs, siamese tiger fish and other large species of catfish. Feeding arowanas can sometimes be a challenge because some adults only accept live foods. Arowanas are carnivores and have strong predatory instincts. They can be fed on a diet of feeder goldfish, frogs and shrimp. Arowana are one of the largest growing species of aquarium fish and can sometimes reach lengths of over 4 feet. Breeding arowanas in an aquarium is virtually impossible and most arowana are bred in large fish farms in Asia. Arowana are mouth brooders and the males of the species carry the eggs in their mouths until the fry are hatched and their yolk sacks are fully absorbed. Arowana eggs are bright orange in color and the fry look like tiny marbles during the first few weeks of their lives. In most breeding farms, breeders \u201charvest\u201d arowana fry by capturing the brooding males and forcing their mouths open, causing them to drop their broods of eggs or fry.

While barbs are generally a hardy species of fish and are capable of adapting to a wide range of water conditions, it is recommended that you research each specific species\u2019 requirements and recreate those conditions in the aquarium in order for them to thrive. Barbs are omnivores and can be fed on a diet of flake or pellet based aquarium foods. Their diet should also be supplemented with occasional live foods and vegetables. Barbs are a schooling species of fish and should ideally be kept in large groups of 10 or more. Most species of barb aren\u2019t difficult to breed and will spawn readily in the aquarium when given adequate nutrition and good water conditions. It is however recommended that separate breeding tanks be used to breed them because the adults of the species will readily devour their own eggs and fry on sight.

The basslet is a relatively peaceful and hardy species of fish, making them a popular choice among most marine aquarists. Basslets are native to the Western Atlantic Ocean. Basslets are an extremely colorful family of fish. They come in shades of red, yellow, orange, purple, tan, black and white. Basslets are generally a peaceful species of fish and make great additions to most community aquariums. They can also be housed in reef and nano reef aquariums. As deep water dwellers they prefer aquariums with plenty of coral and rock cover and subdued lighting. Basslets, however, can be extremely aggressive and territorial to their own kind in an aquarium environment. Each one will claim a small territory including a hiding place as its own and will fight other basslets viciously for these territories. When raising a few basslets in the same aquarium it is important to provide them with ample hiding places and to introduce them to the aquarium simultaneously. When first introduced to the aquarium it is not uncommon for these fish to spend days, if not weeks, hiding in caves and crevices before feeling comfortable enough to explore their new habitat. For this reason, it is unadvisable to introduce them into aquariums with aggressive tank mates as they can sometimes hide out for long periods of time and starve to death. Basslets are carnivores and will readily accept live foods such as brine shrimp and mysis shrimp. They can also be trained to accept most flake and pellet based foods. Basslets are generally a peaceful species of fish and make great additions to most community aquariums. Certain species of basslet have been bred in captivity since the 1960s. When spawning, the male will build a nest using algae and tiny pieces of plant matter. They lay up to 400 eggs per spawn and both parents guard the spawn until they hatch. Like many other marine species, they are sequential hermaphrodites meaning they have the ability to change sex depending on their reproductive situation.

While the most common type of Betta Splenden found in pet stores is the veil tail Betta, modern Betta Splendens have been selectively bred to create a dazzling array of fin shapes and color variants. Bettas are a generally peaceful species of fish, but are extremely aggressive towards their own kind. Often referred to as Siamese fighting fish, Betta males cannot be kept together in the same aquarium as they will fight each other, sometimes to the death. When confronted with their own reflections, male Bettas will flare out his gills, spread his fins and attempt to attack this reflection. Males and females should also be kept separately, except when breeding, as the males will harass and attack the females as part of the courtship ritual. However, it is possible to keep one male with several females in a moderately sized aquarium where the females can escape the male\u2019s aggression by swimming out of reach. Betta Splendens are one of the hardiest species of freshwater aquarium fish and are an incredibly popular mainstay among hobbyists. Bettas are native to the swamp lands and paddy fields of Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. Betta Splendens come in a variety of colorations such as blue, turquoise, red, yellow, white, opaque, chocolate and black. They also come in various bi-color and multi-color variants referred to as marbles, butterflies and Cambodians. Betta Splendens are an incredibly hardy species of aquarium fish, and this sometimes leads to aquarists housing them in very poor aquarium conditions. It is not uncommon to see Betta Splendens housed in tiny jars full of dirty water. However, Betta Splendens thrive when raised in a moderately sized aquarium with lots of plant cover and subdued lighting. Betta Splendens are Labyrinth Fish and are able to breathe by inhaling surface air. For this reason, it is important to ensure that the Betta Splenden aquarium has sufficient open surface areas and also that the water in the aquarium is not disturbed by powerful filters. Although Bettas can be kept with other types of tropical freshwater fish, they should not be kept with tank mates with large, flowing fins like guppies or angel fish, as the Bettas will often start nipping at them. Betta Splendens are carnivores and can be fed on a diet of flakes and pellets. Their diet should also be supplemented with protein rich live foods such as bloodworms and mosquito larvae. Betta Splendens are an incredibly hardy species of aquarium fish, and this sometimes leads to aquarists housing them in very poor aquarium conditions. Great care should be taken when breeding Bettas because of the particularly violent nature of their mating ritual. If introduced into a small breeding tank, a male will quickly start chasing and harassing a female. For this reason, it is advisable to condition the two fish separately for a week or two prior to breeding on a high protein diet. The female should then be introduced to the male\u2019s breeding tank in a jar or breeding trap. The male will flare his gills and fins and dance around the female, attempting to attack her. If the female is ready to breed at this point, she will often display two to three vertical stripes along her abdominal region. The male will then start constructing a bubble nest by inhaling air from the surface and blowing out tiny bubbles that stick together. Once the bubble nest is complete and the female is released, the male will entice her under the bubble nest and wrap himself around her, squeezing out her eggs and fertilizing them at the same time. This spawning ritual will repeat itself over and over until all the eggs are collected and placed in the bubble nest. Once spawning is complete, the male will chase the female away and she should be then removed from the breeding tank. The male will then take care of the eggs and the newborn fry.

They are characterized by their long, eel-like bodies and unique dorsal finlets. These spiny finlets vary in number from 7- 18 and have double edged tips. The rest of the bichir fins are spineless and are made of soft rays. Their body is covered in thick, bone-like scales which along with its fleshy pectoral fins give it its prehistoric appearance. Most bichir are large in size and can reach up to 38 inches in length. There are a lot of unique traits this unusual fish breed boasts. Bichirs are capable of breathing surface air through a specialized swim bladder and can use their powerful pectoral fins to crawl over short distances over land. Owing to this, they will need a large aquarium with a lid, as they\u2019re prone to slinking out of the tank. These freshwater fishes are imposing nocturnal carnivores, and as such, they will need to be housed properly. Choose their tankmates carefully and make sure that they\u2019re only housed with compatible roommates- in other words, those fishes that won\u2019t become their food or eat all of the food. Bichirs are certainly an impressive breed, with a distinct ancient appearance that appeals to many aquaristics enthusiasts. Their prehistoric looks also earned some of the varieties appropriate common names, such as the dinosaur eel, dinosaur Bichir, swamp dragon, or dragon fish.  If you are looking for an unusual-looking addition to your freshwater tank and think Bichirs are a perfect choice, read on to see if this breed is compatible with your set up and its inhabitants. Bichirs are a species of primitive freshwater fish. They are characterized by their long, eel-like bodies and unique dorsal finlets. All species of Bichir are native to tropical Africa and the Nile River system, extending their habitat to India as well. They live in muddy waters and hide in vegetation to hunt their prey. Experts claim that Polypteridae, which is the scientific name for this fish family, first appeared in the last period of the Mesozoic era. This means that these ray-finned fishes don\u2019t only look archaic, but they actually are ancient- their family has been around for about 60 million years. In addition to their thriving populations in the wild, Bichirs are also bred in captivity and make a popular aquarium fish. If you want a flashy fish whose vibrant colors will brighten your tank\u2019s interior, this freshwater fish breed is not for you. Bichirs are often dull colored in shades of brown, grey and black. There are some minor exceptions to this rule, though, with varieties such as Ornate Bichir. The black and yellow intricate patterning might not be as exotic as the colorful scales of Discus or Flowerhorn, but it is far more impressive than beige and grey tones of other Bichirs.  To no one surprise, the Bichir fishes are exceptionally hardy and adaptable. These freshwater dwellers are not overly demanding and won\u2019t need much fussing over to thrive in most set up. However, there are some important requirements to take into consideration if you want to make sure this archaic fish lives long and healthy in your care. In captivity, Bichirs can live for up to 10 years if their needs are met. All Bichirs are large and will need a size-appropriate aquarium to live in. As a rule of thumb, the tank shouldn\u2019t be less than 50 gallons. When it comes to pH and general quality of water, these fishes are not finicky and won\u2019t mind if they\u2019re swimming around in plain tap water. Just be mindful of their tropical habitats and make sure that the water temperatures are between 25 and 29 degrees Celsius. Adult bichir are primarily bottom dwellers but will often shoot up towards the surface to breathe in air. Bichir are also powerful jumpers and are known to wander off using their powerful pectoral fins after escaping from aquariums. They can even use their strong fins to climb out of the tank, so you could say they\u2019re somewhat of a fish Houdini. It is important to cover their aquarium with a heavy, tight fitting lid. Bichirs also prefer aquariums with a soft substrate on which they can rest comfortably on. They are a predatory species of fish and also appreciate hiding places made of rocks and driftwood to which they can retreat to. However, even though they are a predatory species of fish, Bichirs can coexist peacefully with most large, non-aggressive types of Cichlids and Catfish. Basically, as long as as their tank mate is half their size, they will get along well. This makes them a great choice of fish for the aquarist looking to start out with raising large predatory species of fish. Bichir are carnivores and thrive on meaty foods such as shrimp, mussels and baitfish. Bichir use their sense of smell to locate food and sometimes can be late to discover their feed. Attention should be paid to ensure that bichirs in a community aquarium get their fair share of food. Adult bichirs are primarily bottom dwellers but will often shoot up towards the surface to breathe in air. The task of breeding bichirs is a highly demanding task which may sometimes take months of planning. Bichirs can also be highly aggressive towards new mates and can start fight each other.

Clownfishes are characterized by their beautiful colorations and waddle like swimming motions. They are also unique in the fact that they develop special symbiotic, mutually beneficial relationships with sea anemones. Unlike most other species of fish, clownfish are immune to the anemones poisonous tentacles and use them as hiding places to escape from predators. The anemones benefit equally from the clownfish\u2019s presence because the fish lure unsuspecting predators into the waiting tentacles of the anemone. These fish also feed on the leftovers of the anemone\u2019s victims and in turn help provide further nutrition to the anemone through their feces. Clownfish are arguably the most popular species of fish amongst saltwater aquarium enthusiasts. Clownfishes originate from the warmer regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans. Clownfishes usually come in yellow, orange, red and blackish colorations. Most species have several distinctive white bars or patches. Clownfishes are a relatively hardy species of fish and make a good choice for most beginner aquarists. When given adequate nutrition and excellent water conditions they can often live for up to 6 years in captivity; and there are also reports of aquarists who claim to have raised even older clownfish. Tank raised clownfishes will often adapt much faster to aquarium life than their wild counterparts, but are slightly more expensive. Clownfish prefer aquariums with open swimming spaces and plenty of hiding places. If you plan on providing your clownfishes with a host anemone, it\u2019s best to research the best species of anemone for your specific species. That said there is no guarantee that your clownfish will take to the anemone as a host. It\u2019s also important to research the specific requirements to raising anemones as they often require very specific lighting conditions to survive. Clownfishes are a fairly peaceful species of fish and make excellent tenants for most community aquariums. They can however turn aggressive towards other clownfish and it is best to keep a single clownfish or a mated pair in an aquarium. Clownfishes are omnivores and will readily accept most types of food including aquarium flakes. Their diet should also be supplemented with various live foods and vegetable based foods. Clownfish are a relatively hardy species of fish and make a good choice for most beginner aquarists. Clownfish are all born male. When breeding, the larger, more dominant males turn into females and form breeding pairs. They lay their eggs on flat surfaces and will guard them zealously. Clownfishes are considered to be one of the easier species of saltwater fish to breed in the aquarium.

Also known as cories or cory catfish, Corydoras catfish are generally docile fish that do well in a community setting. With their cute little \u201cmustachios\u201d, these fishes are a scaled-down, miniature version of a classic catfish. Being well known as an aquarium pet, the cory catfish can display a wide range of unique and fun patterns and colors. In optimal surroundings they showcase a great temperament and plenty of favorable features \u2013 all of which make them ideal aquarium fishes. These catfish are bottom feeders and they are best kept in groups with six or more of their own species.  Corydoras catfish are generally docile fish that do well in a community setting. Different species of Corydoras catfish can be found in different areas, but most are distributed throughout South America. These fish tend to inhabit quiet, slow moving waters where the bottom is heavily planted or covered with mud and detritus. This means that they are commonly found in small streams, marshlands, river margins, and ponds. These environments allow them to engage in bottom feeding along the murky waterbed, where they get necessary nutrients from the bottom deposits. Of course, this somewhat inhospitable natural environment allowed the corys to become hardy and resistant, and quite easy to thrive. And these attributes are perfectly transferred to their life as aquarium fish. Still, they do not do well in salt water, so keep that in mind. Corydoras catfish come in a variety of colors and patterns, though most exhibit some combination of black, gray, or brown in their coloration. Many Corydoras species exhibit spots or bars of color on their bodies and fins, though there are albino variations of several species as well. Their diverse coloration makes them quite a unique addition to any aquarium. In some cases, they can blend in perfectly with the bottom layers of sand, detritus, or silt. Then again, certain spotted color patterns can make them stand out easily. Either way, corys can be the true masters of aquarium camouflage, and it can take you quite a while to find them once they are hunkered down at the bottom. For those who love unique and mesmerizing patterns, bright colors, shimmering hues, and a unique presence in the tank, a Corydoras catfish can be the ideal addition to any setting.  Because these catfish come from the tropical regions of South America they prefer warm, slightly hard water with a pH between 6.0 and 8.0 as well as a water hardness level between 5 and 19 dGH. The ideal temperature range for Corydoras is between 68\u00b0F and 82\u00b0F. These fish prefer planted tanks with plenty of hiding places available, especially with broad leafed plants for spawning. Corydoras catfish are fairly hardy and easy to keep with other community species, though they do not do well in tanks with high nitrate levels and hard substrate should be avoided so they do not damage their barbels. Keep in mind that corys tend to work well with other fish in the aquarium. They are not aggressive, and will spend their time hunkered down or merrily rummaging for food on the aquarium\u2019s bottom. Contrary to some other fish breeds, corys tend to be most active around twilight. Also, it is worth knowing that a Corydoras Catfish can be quite the long-lived fish. In an ideal aquarium setting, corys can often reach a lifespan of 20 years! One example reached a ripe old age at 27 years old! Talk about a hardy fish! Corydoras catfish come in a variety of colors and patterns. Corydoras catfish are bottom feeders and scavengers that will feed on various types of detritus including decomposing plant material and uneaten fish food. These fish will also eat small insects and crustaceans as well. In the home aquarium, Corydoras catfish should be fed sinking wafers or pellets as well as some live and frozen foods as a supplementary diet. To ensure they are getting the very best for them, and that they can reach their lengthy lifespan, always consult with an experienced aquarist or your vet \u2013 they can provide valuable advice and point you towards the best fish food.   When overall conditions in the tank are considered, one behaviour pattern by the cory can be a great indication. These fish have a tendency to dart towards the surface and grab some air on top. They do this a few times a day and it is completely normal. However, if you observe this numerous times per day, it indicates that the quality of the water in the aquarium is not good. Act accordingly! Sexing Corydoras catfish can be tricky but females tend to be larger and more full-bodied than males. All Corydoras catfish are egg layers and they tend to deposit their eggs on flat surfaces such as rocks, plant leaves, and the walls of the tank. This practice often makes eggs easy to observe. Corydoras can sometimes be encouraged to spawn by systematically lowering the tank temperature by a few degrees over the course of several days to simulate the rainy season. There are more than 150 species of Corydoras catfish but some of the most popular species for the home aquarium include Aldofo\u2019s Corydoras, Bronze Corydoras, Skunk Corydoras, Sterba\u2019s Corydoras, Emerald Corydoras, Pygmy Corydoras, Panda Corydoras, Peppered Corydoras and Albino Bronze Corydoras. This amazing diversity is amongst the best ones in the world of aquarium fish \u2013 it gives plenty of choices for every enthusiast. Hale, hearty and pretty, the cory is ideal!

Most eel are bottom dwellers and prefer aquariums with soft substrate like sand, smooth gravel or peat. Many species even enjoy burrowing deep into the substrate and this should be taken into account when setting up the eel aquarium. Most species of eel are nocturnal and enjoy dimly lit aquariums with plenty of hiding places. Aquarists can use rocks and driftwood to create caves and hiding places in which the eels can hide in. Eel are however very active swimmers and also require large open swimming spaces. Different species of eel vary in temperament and should be carefully researched before purchase. Some species of eel are extremely aggressive and are best in species aquariums. There are however relatively peaceful species of eels that can be kept with large, non-aggressive tank mates. Almost all eel are however opportunistic predators and will eat any fish that they can fit in their mouths. Eels are carnivorous and can be fed on a range of live and frozen foods like shrimp, small crustaceans, mosquito larvae, tubifex worms and bloodworms.

Its most astounding feature is its completely transparent body which reveals its bones and internal organs, hence its name. These stunning fishes also have a shy, peaceful temperament and need to be kept with tankmates of similar size and nature. Even better- buy five or more Glass Fish for your tank, as this will minimize their shyness and need to hide. The reason for this is that they are so-called schooling fish, which means they do best when they have a group of their fellows to stay together and swim in the same direction with. When buying this fish from a pet store it is important to avoid fish labeled \u201cdyed glassfish\u201d or \u201cdisco fish.\u201d These are fish which have been injected with artificial dyes to make them more attractive to the average hobbyist.

Also known as the Indian Glassy Fish and sometimes as the Malaysian Glassy Fish, the glass fish is one of the more fascinating species of aquarium fish. These striking translucent fishes originate from South Asia. Their native habitat is in areas from Pakistan to Malaysia, which accounts for the Parambassis Ranga common name- Indian Glassy Fish or Malaysian Glassy Fish. They usually occur in standing water, such as impoundments (dammed streams)- and it is freshwater that they live in. This is important to note because the myth that Glass Fish needs to live in a brackish tank is very common among both novice and experienced aquarists.  Glass fish are completely transparent in color. Males often develop a black tinge on their dorsal fins. Any traces of exotic, vivid colors is the result of artificial dyeing, a process that is painful and harmful for the fish.   Glass fish are a small species that grows only up to about 3 inches in length. However, this does not mean that they don\u2019t need a spacious tank. As a rule of thumb, the tank shouldn\u2019t be smaller than 10 to 20 gallons, but the ultimate size will depend on other inhabitants and the number of Glassfish in it. They are a schooling species of fish and do best when kept in large shoals. A minimum of 5 Glass Fish per tank is recommended, but you can get more of them is the size of the aquarium allows it. When kept alone or in small groups, these fish can become extremely timid and suffer from stress. They will hide all the time and their quality -and length- of life will be seriously lowered.  The water in the tank should be freshwater, slightly acidic to slightly alkaline with a pH value of 6.5 to 7.5. Brackish water makes them lethargic and it\u2019s not suitable for their living environment. Glass Fish prefer large freshwater tanks with a lot of free space for swimming (they are fast and playful swimmers), paired with heavy vegetation and rocks to mimic their habitat. Owing to their place of origin, these fishes also require the water temperature to be at approximately 68\u00b0 to 86\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit to thrive.  These fish are a very peaceful species and make excellent tank mates for other small to medium sized, non-aggressive fishes. They should not be kept with larger, predatory species which may harass or devour them. Ideally, their choice of aquarium companions would include species such as Guppies, small Tetras, or White Cloud Mountain Minnows. In general, Glass Fish is not demanding in terms of maintenance and care they require. Compatible tank mates, basic equipment setup for optimal freshwater conditions and your translucent stunner will be healthy and happy in your tank. As long as their needs are met, they can live for up to 3 to 4 years- if they weren\u2019t injected with dye.  Glass fish are carnivores and thrive on live foods such as mosquito larvae, tubiflex worms and blood worms. They can also be fed with frozen and freeze dried foods. Flakes should be avoided, because they don\u2019t seem to have an appetite for it.  Glass fish are a small species of fish that grows only up to about 3 inches in length.

Gobies are carnivores and can be fed on both live and frozen foods like brine shrimp, blood worm, daphnia and Cyclops. Most species of goby rarely grow more than a couple of inches in length. Gobies are not an easy species of fish to breed in the home aquarium. They often require very specific changes in their water parameters to spawn. The breeding tank should also have ample caves and hiding places. Most breeders advice keeping one male goby with three females. When the fish are ready to spawn, the male will try to entice the females into a spawning site, usually a cave or flower pot. The female will then lay her eggs on the roof or wall of the cave and the male will promptly fertilize them.

Over the years they have been selectively bred into many variants with different body shapes, physical characteristics and colorations. Goldfish are one of the first species of fish to be domesticated and are also one of the most commonly kept aquarium pets. Goldfish first originated over a thousand years ago in ancient China as a result of a natural color mutation that occurred in the common Asian carp. The ancient Chinese started selectively breeding these fish with the naturally occurring yellow and orange color mutations and developed the first goldfish during the Song Dynasty. Goldfish are most commonly red, yellow or orange in color, but also come in black, white, chocolate, bicolor, tricolor and calico color variants. Most goldfish breeds are incredibly hardy and can survive in the most meager of aquarium conditions; but when given adequate space and care they can reach lengths of over ten inches and live for up to fifteen years. Fancier breeds, however, require more specialized care. They prefer soft, pH neutral water with colder temperatures. They can also survive for short periods of time in bodies of water that are frozen over, making them excellent pond fish. Except for the Comet and Common, most breeds of goldfish are slow swimmers and should not be kept with fish faster swimming fish that can out-swim and out-compete them for food. They are also extremely peaceful and should not be raised with more aggressive species of aquarium fish which can start harassing them. These fish also produce a very high amount of waste, so an adequate filtration system and timely water changes are a must for the aquarium.

Most goldfish breeds are incredibly hardy and can survive in the most meager of aquarium conditions. Goldfish are one of the easiest species of aquarium fish to breed and will spawn quite prolifically when given adequate space and the right conditions. The easiest way to induce breeding is to first condition the goldfish on a protein rich diet and then gradually increase the aquarium or pond temperature by a few degrees. They will readily devour their own eggs and fry, so the use of a heavily planted aquarium or spawning mats is recommended when breeding them.

Gourami are generally a peaceful type of fish but can turn territorial when not given adequate space. When raised in aquariums less than 30 gallons in size, they can sometimes start harassing their tank mates in an attempt to mark out their territory. It is always advisable to keep one male gourami with a few females due to the tendency of males to turn aggressive towards each other despite the size of the aquarium. Gourami are a relatively hardy species of freshwater aquarium fish and are thus suitable for most intermediate aquarists. Gouramis are native to parts of South and South East Asia. Various species of gouramis range in color from blue, green, yellow, gold, pink, white and red and also come multicolored varieties. Gouramis are relatively easy to care for and will thrive in moderately soft, pH neutral water conditions. They are a species of labyrinth fish and are able to inhale surface air. For this reason, it is important that the aquarium has sufficient surface space and also that there is no great water turbulence. Gouramiss, depending on their species, can vary in size from a few inches in length to over 24 inches. For instance, the dwarf gourami only grows to about 1.5 inches in length, whereas the giant gouramis can grow to over 2 feet in length. Thus it is important when selecting gourami for your aquarium to be aware of their growth potential. They are a relatively non-aggressive species and can co-exist with most other species of tropical fish. They do however have a tendency to start harassing and on occasion even kill smaller species like guppies and male Bettas with long flowing fins. Gouramis are omnivores and can easily be fed on a diet of flake or pellet based aquarium foods. They will also devour most types of worms and insect larvae. Gourami are relatively easy to care for and will thrive in moderately soft, pH neutral water conditions. When breeding gourami, it is important to use a separate aquarium meant especially for this purpose. The aquarium should be dimly lit and well planted. When spawning, a male will build a bubble nests made of saliva covered bubbles. The male will often incorporate pieces of plant matter to these nests and they can sometimes cover nearly a quarter of the aquarium\u2019s surface. Gourami spawning occurs in a characteristic \u201cembrace\u201d where the male wraps himself around the female, fertilizing her eggs as she releases them.

Most aquarium kept species of grouper are incredibly colorful and have complex patterns and markings on their bodies. They come in shades of red, yellow, orange, blue, green, purple, brown, white and black. The most important consideration before purchasing groupers for your aquarium is its potential size. It is not uncommon for novice aquarists to purchase young fish that are only a few inches in length to soon find out that they cannot keep up with the growth potential of their fish. For this reason it is advisable to always house groupers are in very large aquariums of 200 gallons or more. They also prefer aquariums with large open swimming spaces as well as plenty of hiding places. They feel more comfortable and will be less reclusive in the aquarium when they have hiding places which they can retreat to when feeling threatened. The size of the aquarium is also important because of the significant amount of waste that these fish produce.

Guppies prefer fairly hard, pH neutral water and well planted aquariums with ample swimming space. Guppies thrive in well oxygenated water, but do not like too much turbulence. So it is advisable to use a less intrusive filtration system like a sponge or box filter in the guppy aquarium. While not a schooling fish, the guppy does well when kept in large groups. They can co-exist peacefully with most other small to medium sized, non-aggressive species of aquarium fish. Care should be taken not to raise guppies in aquariums with larger cichlids or catfish, as the guppies will often be swallowed whole by these larger tank mates. When given adequate care, a guppy will often live up to 3 years. Guppies are omnivores and will readily accept most flake based aquarium foods.

Guppies are one of the hardiest species of freshwater aquarium fish and the care that they require is very minimal. Guppies are prolific breeders and need no encouragement whatsoever to start breeding in the aquarium. Once they reach maturity the males develop a modified anal fin called a gonopodium which they use to impregnate the females with tiny packets of spermatozoa. Guppies are livebearers and the females give birth to the fry after a gestation period of 28-32 days. Female guppies also have the ability to store sperm from various males for long periods of time, enabling them to give birth multiples times even in the absence of a male. It is important to provide adequate plant cover or hiding places for the fry because guppies will quickly devour their own young when spotted. It is advisable to remove pregnant female from the community tank and into a smaller, heavily planted 5 gallon birthing tank.

Hogfish are a reef-dwelling species of wrasse extremely popular in the modern aquarium trade. Hogfish are native to the Western Atlantic Ocean. Hogfish are a vibrantly colored species of fish that come in dark shades of red, yellow, maroon, green, blue, brown and black. Their bodies are also often covered in intricate patterns and markings. Hogfishes are a fairly hardy and disease resistant species of fish that are able to adapt to life in the aquarium quite easily. They are also generally a peaceful species of fish and make excellent additions to most community aquariums. Adults can however turn territorial towards newer tank mates and other hogfishes. For this reason it is important when keeping groups of hogfish in the same aquarium to introduce them all to the tank at once. Hogfishes are active predators and should not be housed with smaller species of fish. They will also actively hunt small species of crustaceans and worms kept in the aquarium. Hogfishes do best when housed in aquariums with a large amount of coral and a soft sand substrate. They should also be provided with a fair amount of open space in which to swim in. Hogfishes are a fairly hardy and disease resistant species of fish that are able to adapt to life in the aquarium quite easily. Hogfishes are carnivores and should be fed on a varied diet of meaty foods like worms, snails, shrimp, mussels, squid and small fish. Little information exists on the topic of breeding hogfishes in the home aquarium. Most species of hogfishes sold in the marine aquarium trade are wild caught specimens.

Jawfish are species of saltwater fish very similar in appearance to blennies. Jawfishes are found in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Most species of jawfishes have dazzling body colorations and patterns. They come in shades of pastel, yellow, blue, green, brown, black and white. The jawfish is an extremely peaceful species of fish and makes an excellent addition to most community saltwater aquariums. However, care should be taken not to house jawfish in aquariums with larger, more aggressive tank mates that can harass or prey on them. Jawfishes do best when housed in aquariums with a thick layer of sand substrate. These fish enjoy digging lengthy tunnels in the substrate and use these tunnels as protection from potential predators. In the aquarium they can be seen lounging near the openings of their tunnels and darting in and out of them in search of prey. They defend the immediate areas surrounding their tunnel openings, and when keeping several jawfishes together it is advisable to use a great deal of rock and coral to break up each fish\u2019s line of sight. This reduces the area that each fish will feel the need to defend and will help curb displays of aggression. These fish will also often spend a considerable amount of time arranging the sand and rubble to create the perfect burrow for itself and this makes for a highly fascinating sight in the aquarium. These fish should also be housed in aquariums with tight fitting lids as they can sometimes attempt to jump out when feeling stressed or threatened. The jawfish is an extremely peaceful species of fish and makes an excellent addition to most community saltwater aquariums. Jawfish are carnivorous and do best when fed on a meaty and varied diet.

Most species are no more than an inch or two in size, and the largest species often only reach a length of 6 inches. Most aquarium varieties are vividly colored and have medium length, brightly colored fins. These fish are extremely hardy and also exhibit many fascinating behavior patterns. This makes them a popular choice among beginner and more experienced aquarists alike. Most killifish available for purchase are referred to by their scientific names, which can make choosing somewhat difficult for the beginner aquarist. It is advisable to first familiarize yourself with the different scientific names and descriptions of various species through industry specific journals like the Journal of the American Killifish Association before setting out to purchase your own specimens. Killifish are a large family of freshwater fish comprising over a thousand different species. Killifish originate in many different regions of the world including Norm America, Central America, South America, Africa and Eurasia. Most killifish come in a mixture of vibrant colors ranging from blue, red, gold, green, orange, silver and brown. Killifishes are an extremely hardy species of aquarium fish and most aquarium bred varieties can adapt to a range of different water conditions. They\u2019re often kept in smaller aquariums of 5 gallons or less which makes observing them easier. Filtration and aeration is an important consideration in the killifish aquarium because smaller sized tanks tend to accumulate harmful toxins much faster. It is advisable to use a small box type filter or sponge filter in the aquarium. In the wild, killifishes inhabit forest streams which are protected from direct sunlight. For this reason they prefer aquariums with subdued lighting. A heavily planted aquarium with surface growing plants like duckweed can be used to create a dimly lit aquarium which killifish will thrive in. One more important thing to remember when rearing killifish is that they are spectacular jumpers. Even the tiniest of cracks in an aquarium cover is enough for a killifish to jump through. For this reason killifish aquarists should take special care to ensure that their tanks are securely covered with an overhead lid. Most killifish purchased from pet stores will readily accept flake type foods, but it is important to supplement the killifish\u2019s diet with a variety of live foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, mosquito larvae, tubifex worms, black worms, white worms and fruit flies. Killifish are an extremely hardy species of aquarium fish and most aquarium bred varieties can adapt to a range of different water conditions. Different species of killifishes have different spawning methods. Some are referred to as plant spawners and spawn on submerged or floating plants. Other species of killifishes are known as gravel spawners and lay their eggs on the gravel bed of the aquarium. Certain species of killifishes even burrow a few inches deep into the substrate to lay their eggs. Thus it is important to identify the spawning behavior of your killifishes before setting up a breeding tank. Also it is important to note that some species of killifish eggs require a period of dry incubation before being hatched. These periods can vary from a few weeks to even longer than a year. Once spawning has occurred, the eggs should either be harvested from the breeding tank or the parent fish should be removed because killifishes fill readily devour any eggs or fry that they come across. The fry can be fed on baby brine shrimp, infusoria or micro worms until they are large enough to accept crushed flakes.

Their bodies, which are long and powerful, are very similar to that of the wild carp. The Koi\u2019s physical appearance also resembles that of a common goldfish, but unlike the goldfish the Koi has two barbells on the underside of its mouth. They often grow to lengths of over 24 inches and are more suitable for outdoor ponds than aquariums. Koi are one of the most popular types of pond fish. Like its goldfish cousins, the Koi too originated from the common Asian carp. While the exact origins are unclear, it is widely believed that the natural color mutations in the common carp occurred across China and Japan around the same time. But it was the Japanese that started breeding these natural color mutations of carp to create them. While Koi mostly come in white, black, red, yellow, blue, and cream color variants, there are thousands of other color combinations that occur. When fed well and given adequate space, Koi will often grow to lengths of 24 inches or larger. For this reason, it is not advisable to attempt to raise them in an aquarium. Instead they should be raised in large ponds of 1000 gallons or more. Very large Koi will often require ponds of 10,000 gallons or more. They are a relatively hardy species of aquarium fish and thrive in medium hard, pH neutral, moderately cold water. Koi, like their carp ancestors are community fish and thrive when kept in large shoals. They are extremely fast swimmers and should not be kept with slower species of fish because they will often out-swim and out-compete them for food. They should also not be kept with smaller species of fish because they can turn predatory towards them. Koi are omnivores and will eat almost anything that will fit in their mouths. In fact, care should be taken when feeding to ensure that they do not overeat. They can be fed on a regular diet of specialized pellets and sticks and fed occasional treats such as shelled peas, Romaine lettuce, oranges, earthworms, and ghost shrimp. It is also important to remember to lower the protein content of the Koi\u2019s diet during the colder months of the year when their metabolism slows down, and cease feeding altogether in extremely cold temperatures. When fed well and given adequate space, Koi will often grow to lengths of 24 inches or larger. Koi usually spawn during the late spring/early summer months when there is a slight increase of water temperature. Spawning can be encouraged by feeding Koi a high protein diet and slightly increasing the quantities that they are fed over a few days. They often look for heavily planted areas to lay their eggs. This can sometimes be a problem in a pond because they are known to quickly uproot and destroy any sort of plant growth. This problem can be solved by introducing a spawning mat into the pond. It is important to remove the spawning mat as soon as the eggs are laid because Koi will instantly devour any eggs and fry they come across. The eggs usually hatch within 4-5 days and the fry can be fed on brine shrimp and crushed flakes.

It is also important to note that adult angelfish can be very destructive to reef habitats so you may want to limit decorations to live rock rather than corals and other delicate invertebrates. As for the water conditions angelfish prefer, a slightly alkaline pH range between 8.1 and 8.4 is ideal with moderate hardness between 8 and 12 dKH. Marine angelfish are known for their laterally compressed bodies and their bright colorations. Most saltwater angelfish feed primarily on sponges and tunicates \u2013 this is what makes them difficult to keep in the home aquarium. Some species feed on plankton or algae. In the home aquarium, it is best to feed angelfish a wide variety of foods to entice them to eat. Also read: 6 Popular Aquarium Fish You Need To Avoid Most angelfish change drastically in color as they approach sexual maturity. Juveniles and females of different species tend to have more drab coloration while males are brightly colored. It is also interesting to note that it is possible for female angelfish to turn into a male if the dominant male from a harem is removed. Angelfish are pelagic spawners, releasing large quantities of buoyant eggs into the water which then float with the currents until hatching. There are approximately 87 species of saltwater angelfish divided among 9 genera and not all of them are popular in the aquarium hobby.

These cichlids are some of the most aggressive and territorial of all cichlid species so they generally need to be kept alone or in large tanks. For the best results you should pair a single male with multiple females rather than keeping more than one male in the same tank. You should also avoid keeping conspecifics (fish that look similar to each other) in the same tank. The name \u201cMbuna Cichlids\u201d is generally used to describe any of the rock-dwelling species of cichlids native to Lake Malawi. Lake Malawi is one of the two largest Great Rift Valley lakes located in Southeastern Africa. This lake is home to an estimated 1,000 species of cichlid, including over 100 species of Mbuna cichlid. Twelve genera of Lake Malawi cichlids are classified as Mbuna cichlids \u2013 these genera include the following: Mbuna cichlids are some of the most brightly colored freshwater fishes in the world, exhibiting a wide range of colors and patterns. These cichlids are unique in that both the males and females of each species exhibit bright colorations, not just the male. Because Mbuna cichlids are endemic to Lake Malawi, they all have very similar requirements for water conditions. The pH of Lake Malawi ranges from 7.8 to 8.6 and the water is fairly hard with a hardness level of 4 to 6 dH. At the surface, the temperature for Lake Malawi ranges from 76\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F while a lower temperature around 70\u00b0F is common for the lower levels of the lake. Lake Malawi is very rocky along the coastline and that is where Mbuna cichlids are found. An Mbuna cichlid tank should be decorated with plenty of rocks, caves, and other hiding places. Mbuna cichlids are some of the most brightly colored freshwater fishes in the world, exhibiting a wide range of colors and patterns. All Mbuna cichlids are herbivores except for those belonging to the Labiochromis genus. In the wild, these cichlids feed on algae growing on the rocks, supplementing their diet with small insects and crustaceans. In the home aquarium, Mbuna cichlids should be offered commercial flakes, pellets, and granules designed for herbivorous species as well as some fresh vegetables and seaweed wafers. Also read: Cost-Cutting Tips and Tricks for Aquarium Enthusiasts Mbuna cichlids generally begin breeding by the time they have grown to a length of 3 inches \u2013 this usually occurs when they are about 1 year old. Males of the species are usually larger than females and more brightly colored \u2013 the dominant male of any territory will be the most brightly colored. Like other Lake Malawi cichlids, Mbuna cichlids are polygamous mouth brooders. The male digs a nest in the substrate where the female lays her eggs \u2013 the male fertilizes them as she gathers them in her mouth where they will be incubated until hatching.

The male molly is much slimmer in shape than the female and has a modified anal fin which is used in mating. Mollies are one of the most popular species of livebearers in aquarium culture. The molly originates from Central America. Mollies come in a range of colors like black, orange and white and also come in various spotted colorations. In the wild mollies inhibit brackish water environments like estuaries and prefer hard, slightly base water conditions in the aquarium. Mollies also benefit when a little sea salt is added to their aquariums. A relatively adaptable fish, mollies are also able to survive in marine aquariums and freshwater aquariums. Mollies are very active swimmers and their aquariums should be heavily planted with abundant open swimming spaces. Mollies are a relatively peaceful species of fish and are suitable additions to most community tanks. However, they are known to start harassing fish like goldfish or angel fish that have long flowing finnage. For this reason, mollies should either be kept with other livebearers of comparable size like swordtails, or larger more assertive fish that will be able to scare them away if they get too rambunctious. Mollies are herbivores and can be fed on a diet of vegetable based flakes and algae. In the wild mollies inhibit brackish water environments like estuaries and prefer hard, slightly base water conditions in the aquarium. Like most other species of livebearers, mollies are extremely prolific breeders and can quickly overpopulate a large sized aquarium with sufficient plant growth. When breeding mollies it is important to use a heavily planted aquarium or to separate pregnant females into dedicated breeding tanks. Mollies will readily devour their young on sight and the fry should be provided with lots of hiding places in order to survive. Molly fry, like all other livebearer fry, are free swimming at birth and can be fed on crushed flakes or algae.

They are also highly territorial as adults and should ideally be raised by more experienced aquarists. Oscar fish are one of the most popular species of freshwater fish in the aquarium hobby today. Oscars originate in the Amazon River basin in South America. The primary colorations that Oscars occur in are black, brown, orange and red. Albino varieties have also been bred selectively over the years. Although Oscars are often sold as young specimens of 2 inches or less, they can quickly outgrow most medium sized aquariums. They are also active swimmers and require aquariums with large open swimming space. Therefore it is important to house them in fairly large aquariums of 100 gallons or more. Oscars are also a very destructive species of fish and will uproot and destroy any plant life in the aquarium in a matter of hours. They are also fond of rearranging rocks and other aquarium decorations. This should be taken into account when decorating the aquarium. Although the level of aggression can differ from individual to individual, Oscars are generally regarded as an aggressive and highly territorial species. They will often cordon off a specific area of the tank as their own territory and vehemently guard it against other fish regardless of species. Oscars are also aggressive fighters and will sometimes lock jaws and engage in long, drawn out wrestling matches to establish dominance. They are also highly predatory and will readily attack and devour smaller species of fish that they can fit in their mouths. They sometimes also attack larger, less aggressive species of fish like angelfish. For this reason they are best housed with large, moderately aggressive South American cichlids, large species of catfish or pacu. Oscars produce a significant amount of waste and require aquariums with very strong filtration systems to prevent diseases caused by poor water quality. Although Oscars are often sold as young specimens of 2 inches or less, they can quickly outgrow most medium sized aquariums. Oscars are carnivores and can be fed on a diet of fish, worms, shellfish, shrimp and occasional servings of beef heart. They will also accept most meat-based pellet foods. Oscars generally do not display obvious signs of sexual dimorphism and are often very difficult to sex. The best way to obtain a breeding pair is to raise 6 or more juveniles in a large aquarium and to let a pair form naturally. Once a breeding pair is formed, they will try to guard an extremely large territory in the aquarium and can sometimes even kill off most of their tank mates.

Additionally, most of the similarities these two species share end in maturity, especially size-wise. Pacus are also known to develop personalities as they grow older and can sometimes recognize their owners. Their fascinating behaviors make them a popular choice among aquaria enthusiasts. However, the impressive size of these fishes makes them a good choice only for the experienced aquarists who can provide the care they require. An adult Pacu can be over 30 inches long and will need to be kept in a pond or an enormous tank. Even the two types of Pacu that are most commonly sold in pet stores, the Black Pacu and the Red-Bellied Pacu, will grow to this size. In case you have a big aquarium or you are prepared to get one to keep your fish happy in their environment, read on. Pacu has a lot to offer to the right owner but they also have a few quirks and requirements that don\u2019t make them a good match for everybody.  Pacu are a large family of freshwater fish related to the piranha. Pacu fish originate from tropical and subtropical South America. Their natural habitat includes river, lakes and flooded forests, and spans from the depth of the Amazon to River Plate basin. However, despite the fact that their place of origin is South America, several species of Pacu can be found all over the world in the wild. This is the result of the illegal release of Pacu pet fish into the wild after the owners realize that they have grown too big for their tank. Now, there\u2019s Pacu in the wild everywhere from the United States to Scandinavia, and in some areas, these aquarium fishes are becoming an invasive species and a threat to the ecosystem.   Pacu family consists of many different species of fish. Naturally, this accounts for some variations in appearance, and it\u2019s mainly colors that help experts make the distinction between different Pacu species. Not unlike most freshwater fishes, Pacu will also be a bit dull in comparison to their colorful tropical relatives. The main colors of their scales are the typical greyish olive, but the accent colors will depend on the particular species. For instance, the Black or Black-Finned Pacu will have a mainly black body, whereas the Red-Bellied Pacu sports a striking scarlet underside.   The most important thing that you need to know before deciding to raise pacu is that they are an extremely large species of fish. And contrary to popular belief, some species can reach over three feet in length no matter how confined their aquariums are. It is not uncommon for inexperienced aquarists to purchase and raise younger specimens only to realize that they cannot keep up with their great size and extremely demanding aquarium requirements over time. Pacus should ideally live in extremely large aquariums of 150 gallons or more or large outdoor ponds. Care should be taken when decorating and maintaining your aquarium because they are known to use their powerful teeth to sometimes crush aquarium heaters and accessories. Pacu are extremely powerful and can sometimes knock glass lids off aquariums when excited. You should also be mindful of their size and power while you clean the tank. Although they are an extremely peaceful species, they are very inquisitive and have an extremely powerful bite. There are several reports of aquarists who have been severely injured from bites by inquisitive pacus. As for the rest of their care requirements, Pacus are surprisingly undemanding. They feel good in water that has a pH value of 6.0 to 8.0. The temperature of the water should be around  75 to 81 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words, a basic simple freshwater aquarium setup will be a great fit for the Pacu, as long as the tank is big enough to accommodate them.  As for the decoration, live plants are the only thing that\u2019s not always the best idea, as Pacu will gladly devour it in no time.  Pacu is an omnivore and in its natural habitat it will eat anything from seeds, nuts, and locally available plants to smaller fishes and snails. While the Pacu is in its juvenile stages of life, flakes could make the basis of their diet, but as they grow older, their nutrition becomes more complex. Ideally, you would feed them quality pellets, paired with plant food and the occasional worms, blood worms and tubifex. While some species of pacu do look like piranhas, they are herbivores and an extremely peaceful species of fish. Breeding pacus in the home aquarium is incredibly difficult and not a lot of knowledge exists on the subject.

Look no further than Paradise fish, a species that has been tickling the eyes of fish owners for well over a century. Paradise fish are a remarkably colorful species of freshwater fish belonging to the gourami family. They were actually the first species of tropical fish to be imported to Europe nearly 150 years ago, giving them a rather rich history as pets that is uncommon within this species. They have remained popular after all of these years for a reason: these fish really pop in a tank and it is practically impossible to tear your eyes away from them. So what do these glorious creatures look like? Paradise fish have thin, rectangular bodies and are characterized by their long flowing fins. Like gouramis, they also have two thread-like pelvic fins and adult paradise fish tend to grow to around 4 inches in length. Their beauty and extremely hardy nature have made them a popular choice among aquarists for decades. It\u2019s practically impossible to find a home aquarium without at least one of these glorious fish inside. But are they the right fish to bring home to your tank? You\u2019ve come to the right place to find out. Keep your eyes glued to this page and scroll away. We are about to reveal everything worth knowing about Paradise fish. All you need to read the info and make your decision. Paradise fish are a highly colorful species of freshwater fish belonging to the gourami family. Paradise fish originate from the paddy fields and ditches of East Asia. The fish currently exist all over the world as pets. But East Asia is their initial origin. Wild paradise fish usually have both red and blue markings. In modern times, solid red and solid blue paradise fish have been produced by breeders. Paradise fish are extremely hardy and can survive in a range of water and tank conditions. This versatility and relative ease of care is a huge reason why they have remained so popular for so long. However, to keep them at their healthiest, a heavily planted aquarium with moderately soft water is preferred. They can adapt to other scenarios, but that\u2019s the best environment to create for them. In its natural habitat, the paradise fish lives in stagnant pools of water, thus the paradise fish aquarium should have little or no surface water movement for the sake of the fish\u2019s serenity as well as far more important matters. Like gouramis and bettas, paradise fish are also a species of labyrinth fish and can breathe surface air. Thus it is important to ensure that the paradise fish\u2019s aquarium has sufficient surface area for it to breathe. So, maintaining that calm surface should be a top priority of any Paradise fish owner. Paradise fish are highly territorial towards each other. For this reason, it is advisable to keep only one male with a group of females in the aquarium. If multiple males are introduced to the same aquarium, they will fight each other aggressively (typical). Unless you are planning on running an illegal, cruel, and impractical fish fighting league, it\u2019s best to limit your tank to one male Paradise fish. Slow moving fish with long fins like goldfish or angel fish also make bad tank mates for the paradise fish because it will start nipping and harassing them. Paradise fish can also start competing for dominance with other aggressive tank mates of similar size. For this reason, it is best to house them with larger non aggressive species of cichlids and gouramis. Paradise fish might be pretty, but they can also be rather dangerous without the right aquarium partners. So be careful with how you populate your tank if you plan to include any Paradise fish. Like killifish, Paradise fishes too are avid jumpers and care should be taken to adequately cover the top of the paradise fish aquarium. You don\u2019t want any escape artists acting up and causing trouble. So use an adequate cover to ensure that there aren\u2019t any issues in this regard. Paradise fish are omnivores and will readily accept most flake and pellet based foods. However, it is important to supplement their diet with live foods such as mosquito larvae, bloodworms and daphnia. A healthy balance between these to elements of your Paradise fish\u2019s diet will lead to a happy and healthy life for your colorful new gilled friend. Paradise fishes are extremely hardy and can survive in a range of water and tank conditions. Male paradise fishes are often much more brightly colored than females. They also develop much longer finnage when they reach sexual maturity. Like gouramis and bettas, paradise fish are bubble nest builders. To breed them, the male and female fish should first be conditioned separately on a protein rich diet of live or frozen foods. Once the female starts to ripen with eggs, the pair should be introduced in a heavily planted breeding tank. The male will promptly start harassing the female while simultaneously building a bubble nest. Once the nest is complete, the male will entice the female underneath the nest where they will spawn in an \u201cembrace\u201d characteristic of fish in the gourami family. The male will wrap his body around the female and fertilize the eggs as she releases them. This embrace will occur a few times until the female has released all her eggs. Once spawning is complete the male will turn extremely aggressive towards the female. These fish aren\u2019t known for having particularly healthy romantic or parental relationships. So at this point, the female should be removed from the breeding tank and the male left to take care of the eggs and fry. The fry, once hatched, can be fed on a diet of infusoria, baby brine shrimp and micro worms.

Although a peaceful and extremely beautiful species of fish, their highly specific dietary requirements make them unsuitable for beginner and novice aquarists. Parrotfish are a large family of marine fish made up of over 90 distinct species. Parrotfish are found in the tropical and sub-tropical oceans across the world. Most species are vibrantly colored and are adorned with fascinating color patterns and markings. They come in shades of red, blue, green, yellow, orange, grey and black. One of the most challenging aspects of keeping parrotfishes is their very specific feeding habits. They enjoy grazing on coral and rock for algae and adult specimens can wreak havoc on a reef aquarium. Most species grow between 12-20 inches in length and should only be housed in large aquariums with sufficient swimming space. The  aquarium should also be decorated heavily with rocks and live plants to provide numerous hiding places for the fish. They are an extremely peaceful species of fish and make excellent additions to community aquariums. They may however prey on smaller species of fish and crustaceans on occasion. Parrotfishes also excrete a mucus-like substance to form a protective cocoon around themselves in the night. When given adequate care and attention, parrotfish can often live for up to 13 years in captivity. One of the most challenging aspects of keeping parrotfish is their very specific feeding habits.

Everything that you could possibly want to know about about Peacock Cichlids is about to be revealed\u2026 Compared to other Lake Malawi cichlids, Peacock cichlids are relatively peaceful. These fish may be territorial (especially males of the species, ain\u2019t it always the way?), but they are generally not aggressive. Peacock Cichlids can be kept in the same tank with other cichlids as well as other peaceful community species. You\u2019ll have to do a little research to make sure that you that you have the right tank mates for these beauties, but once that is achieved, these fish will be the stars of your aquarium. Compared to other Lake Malawi cichlids, Peacock Cichlids are relatively peaceful. So, where did these gorgeous fish come from? Peacock cichlids are those cichlids belonging to the genus Aulonocara. There are 22 species of Peacock cichlid that have been described, and all of them are endemic to Lake Malawi in eastern Africa. Lake Malawi is one of the African Rift Valley lakes (the second largest) and it is the ninth largest lake in the world. Of course, outside of the wild, these fish are now found in far more places across the globe than within a single lake. These have become quite a popular domestic aquarium breed and with good reason too. Cichlids in general are some of the most brightly colored freshwater fish in the world and Peacock Cichlids are no exception (just look at these pictures, if you need any proof). Male Peacock cichlids exhibit a wide variety of bright colors, often in iridescent shades. Female and juvenile Peacock Cichlids are often drab in color but the males transform as they mature, exhibiting a wide range of colors including blue, yellow, red, orange, gold, and more. It\u2019s this almost show off color palette in the males that lead to the memorable name of these Cichlids. They truly are the peacocks of the fish world. Because all Peacock Cichlids are endemic to Lake Malawi, the habitat requirements of the different species are all quite similar. Essentially, you must recreate the specific nature of that African lake within your home fish tank in order for your Peacock Cichlids to thrive. The pH of Lake Malawi ranges from 7.8 to 8.6 and the water is fairly hard with a hardness level of 4 to 6 dH. At the surface, the temperature for Lake Malawi ranges from 76\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F but the lower regions \u2013 where Peacock cichlids tend to live \u2013 the average temperature remains fairly constant around 70\u00b0F. The ideal tank for this fish will have sandy substrate with plenty of rocks to create caves and hiding places. In order for your Peacock Cichlids to thrive, it is as important to recreated physical environment that these fish are used to as it is to match the pH and temperature. Unlike other Lake Malawi cichlids, these cichlids do not eat plants so you can use some in your tank decoration without fear of them being nibbled down to nothing. These fish exhibit a wide variety of bright colors, often in iridescent shades. Peacock Cichlids are insectivores, which means that they feed primarily on insects. Don\u2019t think that means that they will merely subside on the bugs floating around your house though. That\u2019s ridiculous. Obviously, you\u2019ll still need to feed them through good old fashioned store bought insects, insect corpses, various fish foods. These fish are benthic species, which means that they tend to live in the lower regions of the water column, sifting through the substrate for food. In the home aquarium, they should be offered sinking pellets, wafers, or granules as well as fresh and frozen foods. They won\u2019t necessarily come up to the surface to snack, so you\u2019ll need to choose the food that you purchase accordingly.

The Male Peacock Cichlids tend to be fairly solitary and quite territorial, plus it is easy to distinguish them from females due to their bright coloration (the boys are the ones who truly earned this species the Peacock moniker). Many breed readily in the home aquarium and, like all cichlids, they are egg layers. These fish are mouth brooders so the female will pick up the fertilized eggs in her mouth after spawning and incubate them until hatching. After hatching the female might care for the fry for a week or so but then they will be left to fend for themselves. These fish aren\u2019t particularly dedicated parents.

It is important to remember that it is illegal in many parts of the world, including the United States, to buy, sell or raise most species of piranhas. Piranhas are a family of extremely aggressive freshwater fish made up of more than 30 sub-species. Piranhas originate from the rivers of South America. Piranhas are typically colored in shades of red, blue, green, brown, silver or black. Although commonly thought of as a schooling species of fish, research has shown that piranhas only school as a means of protection from larger species of fish that prey on them. Piranhas appreciate aquariums with heavy plant growth and ample hiding spaces. Different species of piranha vary from 8-18 inches in length when fully grown and should be kept alone or in large groups of four or more in very large aquariums. When cramped for space, these fish can turn extremely jumpy and start attacking each other. While some aquarists are known to have successfully raised piranha with other larger species of fish and sometimes smaller species like tetras and guppies, it is never a foolproof strategy. While they can often be tolerant of extremely large or extremely small tank mates, they can also attack easily when feeling threatened or starved. Care should be taken when cleaning the aquarium as they can easily remove large chunks of flesh with a single bite. Piranhas are heavy eaters and thus produce an extremely large amount of waste. For this reason it is important to ensure that the aquarium has adequate filtration and also that water changes are carried out every week. Most species are omnivores, but show a strong predilection towards meat. Piranhas thrive on live foods and it is virtually impossible to get piranhas to accept most flake based foods.

Century later, there are many Platies varieties on the market, in all colors and color combinations, but still retaining the original charm that made them so popular in the first place. Without asking much in return, Platies bring a lot of interest to any tank, especially if kept in groups. Their energetic swimming only draws attention to their pretty scales and delicate form. Platies are fairly small fish, growing no more than 3 inches long, and they are peaceful and non-aggressive \u2013 this makes them a great addition to the community tank. To boot, their vibrant and vivid scales give them a striking appearance that doesn\u2019t go unnoticed, no matter who their aquarium mates are. If you\u2019re a novice hobbyist or an experienced aquarist, you will surely find room in your tank for these lovely, undemanding fish. Read on to learn more about the Platies and the care they require! Platies are small fish, growing no more than 3 inches long, and they are peaceful and non-aggressive. The Platy is native to the warm waters along the east coast of southern Mexico and Central America. These fish tend to inhabit slow-moving waters such as ditches, canals, and warm springs. The wild Platy is drab and dull in coloration with no distinctive markings. The Platy known in the aquarium trade has been selectively bred to exhibit a variety of colors and patterns. The most popular colors of the aquarium Platies include black, blue, brown, gold, red, and green. And that\u2019s just when speaking about the mono-colored fish! In addition to the stunning array of vibrant shades these fish display, there are even more popular varieties of Platies that combine patterns or colors in unique and striking ways.  For instance, salt-and-pepper Platies have dark or light spots sprinkled all over their bodies. With the wagtail pattern, the rays of the caudal and dorsal fins are black, whereas the rest of the body is usually red or gold (sometimes, other colors are possible). Variegated pattern results in dark splotches and these fish are sometimes called the painted Platies, as the pattern resembles a stroke of a painter\u2019s brush. There are many other popular variations that Platy breeders have developed- you will be surprised by the variety and colorfulness of the species.   Platy is a fairly small but active fish that does well when kept in groups with others of the same species and with other small, non-aggressive community fish.  Even though they are quite small, these vibrant fish need to have enough space to comfortably swim around. As a rule of thumb, they will need an aquarium that holds at least 10 gallons of water. A lot of people think that Platy fish don\u2019t need as much space, you should consider the fact that they are rarely kept on their own. Usually, Platies are kept in groups of few specimens and they couldn\u2019t all possibly feel comfortable and happy in a tight, cramped aquarium. A tank for Platies should be planted densely with plenty of rocks, caves, and driftwood hiding places. Every two weeks, replace about 25 percent of the tank\u2019s water, to make sure the environment clean enough. Don\u2019t change more than that- it can shock the Platies into an early death.  Another important thing when it comes to the tank setup is to make sure that you have a tight-fitting lid over it. Although you might not think it when you first see them, the vivacious Platies are notorious jumpers and will easily find their way out of the aquarium. As for other conditions in the tank, these fish are not demanding. Platies prefer warm tank waters in the 70 to 77 temperature range with a fairly neutral pH value between 6.8 and 8.0. These fish do best in soft to slightly hard water between 10 and 28 dH and they can tolerate some salt in the water. Platies are social, peaceful fish that does best when kept in small groups. When you\u2019re buying a Platy, make sure to get at least a pair if not more. Their suitable tankmates are other non-aggressive small species. Potential candidates include Guppies, Mollies, Tetras, Danios or Zebras, to name a few. Wild Platies are drab and dull in coloration with no distinctive markings. Platies are an omnivorous species so they will likely accept anything you offer them. Feed your Platies a high-quality commercial flake or pellet food supplemented with fresh vegetables, spirulina algae, and brine shrimp or other fresh and frozen foods.

These fish prefer to be kept in very large schools with others of their own kind, though they can be peaceful with other fish of similar size. The name porkfish is usually used to describe a particular species of grunt that can be found in the tropical regions of the world. The species most commonly known as the porkfish can be found throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean ranging from Florida to Brazil and throughout the Caribbean Sea into the Gulf of Mexico. The coloration of porkfishes varies, but the main species of this type exhibits a bright yellow coloration with bright blue horizontal striping and vertical black bars through the eye and the pectoral fin. Because these fish prefer to be kept in large groups, you will need a very large tank. Porkfishes tend to inhabit coral and rocky reefs, so the tank should be sparsely decorated with live rock and hardy corals. These fish prefer tropical to subtropical temperatures between 72\u00b0F and 78\u00b0F with a slightly alkaline pH range between 8.1 and 8.4 is ideal with moderate hardness between 8 and 12 dKH.

Puffer fish are often brightly colored and come in shades of red, yellow, green, brown and black. Puffers do best when kept in very large aquariums with plenty of hiding places made of caves, logs and plants. Often, puffer fish will claim a few hiding places as their own. They can also be highly territorial towards each other. For this reason, it is advisable to arrange the puffer fish aquarium in a way that breaks up their line of sight, decreasing the size of the territory each fish will feel it needs to defend. Puffers are an extremely intelligent species of fish and are known to develop distinct individual personalities. Their personalities and temperament can also change as the fish grow older. Most puffers are predators and therefore should be kept alone or in a species tank. Even the milder species of puffer fish can sometimes nip and harass their tank mates resulting in death from stress. There are also reports of puffers that existed peacefully in a community environment as juveniles suddenly turning aggressive towards their tank mates as they grow older. Most species of puffer are carnivores and prefer live foods like shrimp and aquarium snails. Puffer can also be trained to accept a variety of frozen foods.

Many species of goby also enjoy burrowing in the aquarium bottom and should be kept in aquariums with a soft sand substrate. Gobies are also prolific jumpers and should not be kept in open aquariums. They should only be housed in tanks with tight-fitting lids. Gobies are primarily carnivores and should be fed on a meaty and varied diet consisting of live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, krill and plankton. Gobies are also extremely hardy and can adapt to a range of aquarium conditions. There are no known reports of successfully breeding gobies in the home aquarium. In the wild gobies build burrows on the ocean floor out of sand and tiny pieces of coral rubble. Once spawning is complete, the female goby tends to the burrow while the male stands watch over the eggs.

Most aquarium varieties of sharks are dully colored in shades of tan, yellow, brown and grey. Their bodies are often market with various spots and bands. The most important thing to remember when attempting to raise saltwater sharks is that they need extremely large aquariums of 200 gallons or more. The aquariums should also ideally be circular or hexagonal in shape as sharp corners can often restrict the shark\u2019s swimming movements. Shallower aquariums with large surface areas are also preferred. When decorating the saltwater shark aquarium it is important to leave as much open swimming space as possible. It is however advisable to include a few hiding places into which the shark can retreat into. Water quality and stability are two important factors when raising sharks in the home aquarium. A very high quality filtration system and protein skimmer is an absolute must. It is also recommended that large water changes be carried out weekly. Sharks are highly predatory and should not be housed with any other species of fish.

Seahorses are a family of marine fish characterized by their distinctly equine appearance. Seahorses originate in the tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions of most of the world\u2019s oceans. Most aquarium varieties of seahorses come in dark shades of green, yellow, tan, brown, grey and black. Most aquarium kept species of seahorses do not grow more than a few inches tall. However, they should be housed in aquariums with large open swimming spaces and sufficient depth. This is because seahorses often swim in vertical motions as well as horizontal ones. Care should also be taken when choosing a filtration system for the seahorse aquarium as they are best housed in tanks with slow water currents. Seahorses are poor swimmers and will often suffer from stress when housed in aquariums with a strong water flows. As far as the tank d\u00e9cor goes, seahorses should be housed in aquariums with plenty of potential \u2018anchoring spots\u2019. These include live or plastic plants and corals with thin branches. Although an extremely peaceful species, seahorses fare best when kept in a species specific tank or with their close cousins the pipefish. This because the slow seahorses can often be outcompeted for food by other faster swimming tank mates. Seahorses are also fairly sensitive to rapid changes in water parameters. They are easily stressed out by fluctuating water conditions and suffer from weakened immune systems as a result, making them more susceptible to various diseases. Tank bred seahorses are considerably hardier than their wild-caught counterparts, and although significantly more expensive, are much more disease resistant as well. Most aquarium kept species of seahorses do not grow more than a few inches tall. Feeding wild-caught seahorses can sometimes be a challenge because some specimens will only accept live foods. In fact, it is not uncommon for wild-caught specimens to starve to death in the aquarium when not provided with a constant supply of live food. Tank bred seahorses on the other hand will readily accept frozen foods like mysis shrimp and frozen brine shrimp. The seahorse\u2019s spawning ritual is a unique one. When reproducing, the female seahorse deposits a batch of eggs into a special brood pouch located on the male\u2019s body. The eggs are fertilized while within the male\u2019s pouch and are carried around by the male until they are hatched.

Swordtails are also the largest growing species among livebearers and adult swordtails can reach up to six inches in length. A relatively hardy and easy to care for livebearer, the swordtail is one of the most popular aquarium fish species among beginner aquarists. Swordtails are native to the North and Central areas of America including Veracruz, Mexico and northwestern Honduras. While wild swordtails are mostly a drab green in color, most aquarium varieties come in a range of colors including red, orange, black, tuxedo, gold, spotted, neon, albino, silver and blue. Swordtails are relatively hardy and can survive in a range of aquarium conditions. However, they thrive when housed in fairly large aquariums with clean water conditions.

Tangs, also known as surgeonfish, are a highly popular species of saltwater aquarium fish. Tangs originate primarily in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Almost all species of tang are vibrantly colored and come in bright shades of red, yellow, blue, green, purple, brown and black. Most species of tang reach anywhere between 6-12 inches when fully grown and should therefore be housed in sufficiently large aquariums. The royal blue tang can in fact grow up to 16 inches in length and requires extremely large housing. The tang aquarium should be decorated with abundant hiding places as well as ample swimming space. Tangs are also highly susceptible to disease and require extremely stable water conditions. They can easily fall sick when tank conditions decline. When introducing tangs to an aquarium it is very important to quarantine them for at least two weeks to ensure that they are disease free. Frequent water changes and an excellent filtration system are a must. Tangs are generally a peaceful species of fish and make excellent additions to most community aquariums. Fish that have established themselves in the aquarium for some time can however turn aggressive towards new tank mates.

There are over 150 different species of tetras, most of which have small, compressed body shapes. Tetras are also characterized by their tiny adipose fin which is located between their dorsal and tail fins. Most aquarium varieties of tetra are extremely colorful and relatively hardy, making them a popular choice amongst beginner and experienced aquarists alike. Tetras are a species of tropical fish extremely popular in the aquarium trade. Tetras originate from Africa, Central America, and South America. Tetras come in a wide array of shades and color combinations, including red, blue, silver, grey, yellow and white. Tetras are an extremely timid, schooling species of fish and do best when kept in large groups of 10 or more.  When kept in smaller groups or in pairs, tetras can often turn jumpy and suffer from stress. They are active swimmers and thrive when provided with large open swimming spaces. They also appreciate heavily planted aquariums with plenty of hiding places where they can retreat to when feeling threatened. While the water requirements of each species of tetra differ slightly based on their natural habitats, most tetras can adapt to a variety of water conditions. Tetras are extremely peaceful and make excellent additions to most community tanks. However they should not be kept with aggressive species that might harass them, or larger, predatory species that might prey on them. Tetras are omnivores and will readily accept most flake based aquarium foods. There are over 150 different species of tetras, most of which have small, compressed body shapes. While breeding tetras isn\u2019t as easy as breeding livebearers like swordtails or mollies, it is not altogether impossible. However, it is a task that takes a great deal of effort and careful attention. The first step in attempting to breed tetras is learning to sex them. Mature female tetras will be larger in size and will be plumper around the belly region. Males, on the other hand, are usually more vibrant in color and have longer fins. Another important aspect that needs to be paid attention to when breeding tetras is their diet. It is crucial to provide tetras with a varied diet that includes different types of live foods which provide essential vitamins and minerals that are required to get the fish into breeding condition. The water parameters of the breeding aquarium too are of utmost importance. It is sometimes necessary to carry out sporadic water changes and temperature changes to mimic naturally occurring weather patterns to entice tetras to spawn. Once spawning occurs, it is important to promptly separate the parents from the breeding tank because they will readily devour any eggs that they come across.

Trunkfish secrete a poisonous material from their skin which acts as a chemical defense mechanism against predators. Different species of trunkfish can be found around the world in the warmer regions of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The Lactophrys genus of trunkfishes which includes three species is native to the western Atlantic Ocean while Trunkfish vary widely in terms of color and pattern from one species to another. Common colorations for trunkfishes include black, brown, white, gray, yellow, and red. Many trunkfish exhibit spots, splotches, or patches of color. Many species of trunkfish inhabit coral reefs in tropical regions so they require warm water temperatures and reef-like decorations consisting of hardy corals and live rock.
